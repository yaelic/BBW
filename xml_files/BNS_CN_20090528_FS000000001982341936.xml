          <p>Welcome to the presentation of Scotiabank's Second Quarter Results. I'm Luc Vanneste, Chief Financial Officer. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of our results.</p>
          <p>Next, I will go over the financials, including a review of business line performance. We will then have our business line heads review the outlook for their respective businesses. Brian Porter, our Group Head, Risk and Treasury will then discuss credit quality. We will then be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements. Rick, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Luc. Well, clearly the challenging environment that we have been experiencing continues in the second quarter. However, as you can see with our results, we are earning through it. We delivered another quarter of solid earnings.</p>
          <p>Net income of $872 million, or $0.81 a share. Profitability remains high, which looks like an industry-leading return on equity nearly 18%. Furthermore, earnings were driven by record revenues, which increased 12% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Solid performances from all our business allowed us to earn through higher credit provisions.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we have been proactively managing risk. Our focus continues to be on cautious underwriting, increased collections efforts, and prudent provisioning. We continue to have solid capital. Most importantly, we continue to generate a high level of internal capital, which provides support for our dividend, and as needed we have been able to raise capital, mostly non-dilutive from the private market.</p>
          <p>Overall, our capital strength and a high level of profitability gives us the flexibility to pursue growth across all our businesses and support our dividend, which we have maintained at $0.49 per share.</p>
          <p>Canadian Banking delivered strong retail volume growth, while maintaining the appropriate risk tolerances. Personal deposit growth, an area of focus, has also been strong. International benefited from year-over-year wider margins. They also benefited from higher contributions from acquisitions, particularly from Peru. The countries in which we are most active continue to withstand the crisis better than most and have excellent prospects as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Scotia Capital had a record quarter, in part due to wider loan spreads and increased fee income in corporate and investment banking as well and these results reflected strong &#x2013; very strong trading revenues.</p>
          <p>Overall, given the environment, we are pleased with results for the first half of this year. We are maintaining our earnings objectives and our targets, and we think we are well positioned for growth. I would like to provide you with some context as to the outlook and how we see the future.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our outlook is balanced in both the terms of positive influences as well as negatives in arriving at the new normal. On the positive side, the global financial sectors and capital markets are stabilizing, and will improve. The signs are quite evident. Monetary and fiscal government stimulus are having an effect and will continue to positively impact markets and the economy's return to growth.</p>
          <p>Also, while some emerging markets will struggle with GDP growth throughout the remainder of 2009, we believe in 2010 these economies will rebound and we will see renewed growth and at a higher rate than in the developed world. We also believe that in the long-term favorable demographics, impressive improvements in technology, and the continual benefits of globalization will have a positive impact on economic development and growth. But it will affect countries and markets differently.</p>
          <p>There will also be negatives to overcome, which adds some uncertainty to this new normal. Firstly, markets and economies are still fragile and will remain so for some time. Economies and markets will be resetting to lower leverage, new consumption patterns, especially in developed markets such as the United States, and to lower growth and profitability expectations. And finally, we will all be facing more government, more regulation.</p>
          <p>How governments adjust to the new normal and mitigate this unprecedented stimulus will determine how well markets and economies will perform in the long run. I believe we are on the cusp of reaching a more stable economic environment. It will be followed by two or three years of slower growth before a period of more rigorous expansion occurs.</p>
          <p>The big unknown is will governments make those sound and necessary policy decisions and scale back their interventions. For us at Scotia, this all represents a bright future and one of growth and opportunities that we can realize on.</p>
          <p>Our home markets and the international markets in which we have chosen to operate will perform above average. As our numbers show, we have the proven strategies, the strong management teams, and the capital to take full advantage as new opportunities as they arise. This quarter's results reinforce our conviction that we are definitely headed in the right direction.</p>
          <p>With that I will pass to Luc, who will talk about our results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Rick. Net income was $872 million this quarter, up 4% from Q1. This was driven by growth in net interest income, stronger trading and securitization revenues, and lower non-interest expenses. These were partly offset by higher PCLs and higher taxes. Net income was down from last year, primarily due to higher PCLs, writedowns on securities, and higher taxes partly offset by higher net interest income and trading revenues.</p>
          <p>Our productivity ratio was strong at 51.4%, well below our target of 58%. The following three items of note affected our results this quarter: writedowns on available for sale securities were 104 million pre-tax this quarter versus 236 million last quarter; a loss of $36 million on the sale of a portion of our credit card portfolio in Mexico; and thirdly a $29 million reversal of the retail provision no longer required in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenging operating environment, revenues continued to climb to a record level in Q2.  As Rick mentioned 7% up over &#x2013; quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Compared to Q1, net interest income was up 6%. We benefited from the favorable change in the fair value of financial instruments partly offset by the impact of a shorter quarter. Other income grew by 9% driven by higher securitization revenues, higher trading revenues, and higher credit fees. Partly offsetting were lower underwriting and mutual fund fees. Compared to last year, the revenue increase was mostly due to growth in net interest income, strong capital markets revenues and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year asset growth was strong, up 14% in part reflecting the impact of the lower Canadian dollar. Assets were down slightly from Q1. Higher personal loan balances were more than offset by a decrease in residential mortgages and business and government loans. This decline was a function of both reduced demand and more disciplined pricing in our lending products.</p>
          <p>Turning to the margin on slide 12, it increased 18 basis points from the first quarter. The increase was driven by a number of factors including improved lending margins and a favorable change in fair values of financial instruments. Partly offsetting was continued competitive pricing on loans and deposits.</p>
          <p>Moving on to expenses, non-interest expenses decreased 6% compared to Q1. This was due primarily to lower stock and performance-based compensation as well as the positive impact of a shorter quarter. There was also a reduction in discretionary spending in the current quarter commensurate with the Bank's target to maintain the productivity ratio below 58%. Year-over-year expenses are up 5%. However, excluding acquisitions and forex they are actually down by 1%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, we continue to maintain strong capital ratios with a Tier 1 ratio of 9.6% and a TCE ratio of 7.7%. We have been able to do this by selectively raising new capital as well as carefully managing risk-weighted assets. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised $650 million of innovative capital, which will add 25 basis points to our Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the business lines. Canadian Banking had a solid quarter with net income of $410 million. Earnings were down 7% from Q1 mainly due to higher PCLs. Revenues were down slightly from last quarter primarily due to lower Dundee Wealth earnings. Net interest income remained unchanged as the positive impact of a higher margin was offset by the shorter quarter.</p>
          <p>Expenses continued to be well managed, down 4% versus Q1 from lower discretionary and initiative spending in some areas as well as lower stock-based compensation. Compared to Q2 '08 earnings were down slightly as good revenue growth and strong operating leverage was offset by higher PCLs and acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>International also had a solid quarter, with net income of $332 million. Revenues were down 8% quarter-over-quarter driven by three factors: the loss on the credit card sale I previously mentioned; mark-to-market losses on securities; and lower forex revenues versus the record level achieved in Q1.</p>
          <p>Similar to Canadian Banking, expenses continued to be well managed down 6% versus last quarter. PCLs were flat quarter-over-quarter. Higher underlying retail provisions were offset by a $29 million reversal of a retail provision no longer required in Mexico. Year-over-year net income was down 1%; the positive impact of acquisitions, foreign exchange translation, and strong asset growth were offset by higher expenses and higher PCLs.</p>
          <p>As Rick mentioned, Scotia Capital had a record quarter with net income of 328 million, up 9% versus last quarter and 29 year-over-year. Compared to Q1, revenues were up 20%. Global Capital Markets had a record quarter driven by strong broad based trading results, including higher derivatives revenues and a record quarter for precious metals. Fixed income had another strong quarter, although down from a record Q1. Global Corporate &amp; Investment Banking also had a very good revenue quarter, the highest level since Q4, '02.</p>
          <p>Higher spreads and strong credit fees were partly offset by a small decrease in loan volumes. Expenses were down 21% versus last quarter due to lower performance based compensation. Provisions were up 149 million quarter-over-quarter. Q2 provisions included a $50 million auto sectoral provision which Brian will cover in more detail. Compared to Q2 '08, net income increased 29% driven by very strong revenue growth and lower expenses, which more than offset the increase in the PCLs.</p>
          <p>Finally looking at the Other segment, which had a loss of 198 million this quarter compared to a loss of $284 million last quarter. The main reasons for the reduced loss were: higher securitization revenues; a favorable change in fair value of financial instruments; lower net securities write-downs, which were partly offset by continued high mid term funding costs.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. I'll be starting on slide 20. As Luc mentioned Canadian Banking had a solid second quarter. As a result for the first six months of 2009, our earnings are 7% ahead of the same period in 2008. While we have begun to see signs of improvement in the marketplace, we have been operating in a difficult economic environment. That being said, the outlook for Canadian Banking for the remainder of the year is positive in a number of key areas.</p>
          <p>First, looking at revenue and volume growth. We see a number of opportunities for continued growth particularly in retail banking. Year-to-date revenue was up over last year and for the whole year we expect to exceed last year's record level, which underlines our progress in generating sustainable revenue growth. Going forward we are confident that we will continue to grow our balances and fee income in key segments as customers take advantage of historically low interest rates and increased spending. For instance, we expect our new VISA Momentum card, which provides customers with money back savings, to add to our revenue base.</p>
          <p>We are also pursuing opportunities to further strengthen our insurance platform by expanding our product offering and distribution channels. On the deposit side, growth is expected to level off somewhat. We have seen very strong increases so far in 2009 with average balances up 13% compared to 2008. This should moderate in the second half of the year as balances start to move back into mutual funds and equities.</p>
          <p>As equity markets improve, we are well positioned for revenue growth in our existing wealth management businesses and from our investments in CI and Dundee Wealth and our acquisition of E*TRADE. We are making steady progress in building our wealth business. According to Investor Economics, our share of the total Canadian wealth market has increased on each of a six-month, one-year, and three-year basis.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with respect to our acquisitions and investments, in March we rebranded E*TRADE Canada to Scotia iTRADE and our operational integration is progressing very well. Customer retention has been strong, and account acquisition is up 17% from last quarter. Duncan Hannay, the CEO of E*TRADE Canada has been retained as the CEO of Scotia iTRADE. Our existing direct investment business will be merged into Scotia iTRADE. We expect to lever the entrepreneurial spirit of E*TRADE with the strengths of our existing online operations to improve service to our clients and grow this business.</p>
          <p>On the mutual fund side, over the long-term we are pleased with our investments in Dundee Wealth and CI Financial despite market volatility. These are two of the leading wealth management companies in Canada and we see a number of opportunities to partner with them going forward. Dundee Bank has been an excellent source of deposits, which have increased averages by almost $2 billion year-over-year to more than $5 billion this quarter. We are currently working on a white label banking partnership with CI which when implemented will continue to add to this deposit growth.</p>
          <p>Third, we remain focused on managing our costs. The Q2 expense level will likely be the low point for the year, as we benefited from the shorter quarter, lower volume related expenses and lower stock-based compensation. Going forward, however, we will continue to be disciplined with our discretionary spending and have slowed spending on new initiatives while continuing to invest in our key growth platforms. We will continue to deliver positive operating leverage for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>Finally, continued tight risk management remains a key focus going forward. Brian will speak on this issue in more detail later. While provisions increased this quarter, our ratio of losses to assets at 39 basis points continues to be well within our expectations. Similarly, delinquencies have increased but are for the most part where we expected them to be at this stage.</p>
          <p>We have seen some growth in consumer and auto related PCLs, mainly related to our acquisition of Travelers, now called Scotia Dealer Advantage, a small specialized business aimed at first-time car buyers. This is a high profit margin business. We have started to see some results from steps taken to improve the underwriting standards, risk modeling and collections. PCLs should level off going forward.</p>
          <p>Loan loss provisions in the other consumer portfolios have remained fairly steady quarter-over-quarter. On the commercial side, losses are up this quarter due to a couple of specific accounts, as well as the $10 million auto sectoral provision, but they remain within our expected range. Again, we don't foresee any large events in 2009.</p>
          <p>Overall we are comfortable with how our portfolios are performing at this point in the credit cycle. In summary, we are keeping a close eye on the economy, managing our costs and risk base, while still taking advantage of select growth opportunities in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. The year has gone well for International Banking with record first quarter and solid results this quarter. Core businesses continue to perform well. We have achieved these results while growth is slowing in our key markets. The slowdown in North America is being felt globally and our markets aren't immune.</p>
          <p>Mexico for example is feeling the impact of the U.S. downturn through lower exports, foreign investment and tourism. In this challenging environment, the strength and diversity of our franchises and institutional disciplines in areas such as credit risk management, prudent asset growth, margin management, non-interest revenue management, and of course expense control are serving us well and should continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Credit risk management remains a key priority for us. We'll continue our program of stepped up contacts with high-risk customers, and helping good customers meet their payment obligations. We've added resources in technology and collections and we believe the steps that we've taken will ensure that our credit quality stays within approved risk tolerance levels.</p>
          <p>We've traditionally been prudent lenders building strong enduring customer relationships, carefully evaluating and pricing risk and we'll keep this focus. Our margins are up from last year and last quarter, due in part to initiatives that we took well into the year before. We've focused on the basics, not only margin management, non-interest revenues, pricing and focusing on ancillary businesses such as wealth and insurance.</p>
          <p>We kept a tight rein on expenses and we're improving productivity by implementing best practices, consolidating functions, standardizing systems and operating platforms. We've launched a comprehensive review of our purchasing practices that we would expect will produce meaningful savings.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're still focused on rolling out initiatives to drive long-term revenue growth. These initiatives are alive in many markets and will be implemented across the division over 2009 and 2010. Highlights: we're rolling out a major initiative to optimize our top value retail customers. We continue to upgrade our call centers and institute regional hubs. We've completed the rebuild of our retail Internet platform and will shortly do the same for our commercial platform. Two of our competitors have already asked if it's available.</p>
          <p>We have rolled out world-class account management pricing platforms to improve our credit risk management. We're introducing a new financial MIS system to improve how we measure the profitability of customers, channels and product. We're working very closely with global wholesale and global transactional banking to optimize our major corporate relationships. Although we'll have a challenging time over the rest of the year, our results are good and our franchises are holding up well.</p>
          <p>So with that I will turn it over to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. This was a record quarter for Scotia Capital with most businesses performing very well. We were able to benefit from market conditions with strong trading results including record revenues in our metals business and strong revenues in our fixed income and equities businesses.</p>
          <p>Results in our derivatives business were solid and we continue to manage down our positions in several of these books. Our lending business continued to benefit from re-pricing, increased spreads and fees. This has enabled these businesses to earn through the higher level of provisions for credit losses. To date about one-third of our facilities have re-priced. We expect to see some further improvement although the pace of re-pricing may begin to moderate going forward. We've experienced higher provisions for credit losses primarily in the United States, but we believe to a much lesser extent than many of our global competitors.</p>
          <p>We are benefiting from our relative strength in this troubled market: while other global institutions are struggling we are able to continue to service our clients, provide liquidity, write new business and get paid well for it.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from our well-diversified platform of businesses, which have provided sustainable revenue streams through difficult market conditions. And we continue to invest in the fundamental parts of our business.</p>
          <p>The equities business enhancement initiative we undertook late last year continues to bear fruit. Our fully coordinated sales and trading and investment banking efforts have already begun to pay off with higher revenues in both Qs 1 and 2. We are also investing in other businesses, such as infrastructure finance and energy trading to further enhance this diversification and provide revenue growth later in 2009 and into 2010.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from our integrated approach to running the business. We've been very successful on leveraging our lending capability to generate cross-sell throughout the firm. We're also executing our global sectoral strategy in mining, energy and infrastructure, which allows us to be much more coordinated and focused in our marketing efforts.</p>
          <p>We continue to prudently manage credit market and operational risks. In our lending businesses, we've realigned resources to increase our focus on managing our existing portfolios and accounts of concern. Our decision three years ago to effectively exit leverage lending in the U.S. and Europe will pay healthy dividends during this significant downturn.</p>
          <p>In capital markets, we are reducing the size of some of our derivatives trading books and stay disciplined about proprietary trading.</p>
          <p>In summary, we're very pleased with our first half results, the market conditions are favorable. But risk management is still our primary objective. Our focus for the remainder of 2009 is continued execution of our strategy and careful management of risks and expenses.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. I will now discuss the issues on risk. We are managing well through the continuing challenges in the credit markets. This quarter we took a special sectoral provision of 60 million against the wholesale automotive sector. We also added 27 million to our general allowance and took 402 million in specific provisions. We will continue to provision prudently and look to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
          <p>There are a few areas we are particularly focused on. Namely some key segments of our retail portfolios, the commercial portfolios within our international banking division, wholesale auto, and North American real estate.</p>
          <p>I'll elaborate on each of these areas in a few moments. But on balance, we are well prepared for the next stage of the credit cycle. On the market risk front, while there was continued volatility in the markets in the second quarter, we managed to lower VaR and it remains well within our risk tolerances. I will comment first on our provisions this quarter, and then provide some details on our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking first at the breakdown of specific provisions by business line on slide 25. As you can see, the major quarter-over-quarter increase in specific provisions was in Scotia Capital, followed by a moderate increase in Canadian Banking, whereas it remained flat in International Banking.</p>
          <p>I'll make some further comments on our specific provisions, starting with our retail portfolios. Provisions were flat quarter-over-quarter in both Canadian and international retail portfolios, though clearly higher than in 2008 given the current economic environment. For the Canadian book, the provisions are consistent with our expectations. You will recall that 92% of this book is secured. As Chris mentioned, while provisions increased in Scotia Dealer Advantage, a small automotive portfolio we acquired, we are seeing positive signs from derisking and increased collection efforts. Our revolving credit portfolios are more than 50% secured and are performing well. Balance utilization, customer migration, and delinquencies were generally stable in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to International, provisions here largely reflect the impact of our acquisitions in Chile and Peru. On the quarter, provision were flat, as increases in most markets were offset by the one-time reversal of 29 million in provisions no longer required in Mexico. Gross spreads are holding up well given our derisking efforts, new customer assistance programs and selective risk base pricing.</p>
          <p>Looking next at the specific provisions against our wholesale portfolio, the major quarter-over-quarter increase was in Scotia Capital. The Q2 provision of 109 million relates primarily to a major commercial real estate finance company and two real estate accounts in the U.S. The quarter-over-quarter increase in Canadian commercial provisions was moderate. The Q2 provision of 52 million was spread over several accounts. International commercial had recoveries of $10 million, basically all in Peru.</p>
          <p>Now looking at ACL coverage on our credit portfolios, the higher level of provisions we have taken this quarter has improved the ACL coverage on our total loan portfolio, with the coverage ratio rising seven basis points to 95 basis points. For this quarter, our ACL coverage has grown faster than the rate of our loan assets. We are comfortable with our current level of coverage and we will continue to take a prudent approach here.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to make some comments on some of our portfolios and how we are monitoring beginning with the retail area. In the context of this continuing economic slow down, our retail portfolios are performing as expected. We are seeing a slow rise in loan delinquencies in some products. However, they are moderate, and are building from historically low levels. For our product lines that are most impacted by the recession, credit performance is holding up well.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a few examples. In our Canadian card portfolio, delinquencies were stable this quarter at 130 basis points and remain below the industry average. In the Caribbean and Mexico, we are tempering delinquency levels through various actions including assistance plans, loan restructurings and tight monitoring of cards and mortgages. For Mexico in particular, we draw comfort that 86% of the portfolio is secured and mortgage LTVs are in the mid-60s with only limited signs of downward pressure on housing prices at this stage. We continue to proactively manage our small credit card portfolio, tightening underwriting and collections.</p>
          <p>With respect to portfolio management, we continue to be very active. We are paying close attention to our unsecured lines where credit metrics have been fairly stable. For our indirect auto portfolio, our focus continues to be tighter underwriting standards, proactive and rapid collections, and well-executed recovery processes. In our consumer finance segment loss rates will begin to normalize as we continue to apply our credit standards in the businesses we acquired in Chile and Peru. We expect this to take a few more quarters. We continue to tighten our credit policies, balanced against the need to de-risk and to support our customers. In summary, our retail portfolios are performing relatively well and we are managing our coverage levels proactively as we work through the downturn.</p>
          <p>Looking at Slide 30, our International Commercial lending portfolio is currently 38 billion. It is well diversified by geography and industry and is performing relatively well. The portfolio is well secured with an average loss ratio of 35 basis points over the past 18 years. The portfolios in Asia Pacific, Chile and Peru are performing well. For our Mexican portfolios we are monitoring the impact of the swine flu and we are comfortable with the results of our stress testing. Finally, we are closely watching our exposures to hotels in the gaming industry in the Caribbean where we are anticipating some increased provision.</p>
          <p>On our wholesale auto exposure it has come down by 600 million, mainly as a result of a repayment from a European OEM. The current OEM balance relates mainly to Ford and General Motors. As for the dealers and floor planning a significant majority of this portfolio is to customers with multiple dealerships, selling mostly foreign brands. In fact General Motors and Chrysler constitute only 11% of our total dealer exposure.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we are actively monitoring the automotive portfolio and we are regularly stress testing it under a variety of adverse scenarios including the impact on parts suppliers, financing companies, and dealers. In light of the restructuring in the North American auto sector, we felt it prudent to establish a 60 million sectoral provision. This anticipates losses that will be identified over the coming quarters. Having said that, our loan loss experience in this portfolio remains manageable at 22 basis points year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Slide 32 outlines our North American real estate book. This portfolio is well diversified by geography and type of project. Our focus here is to deal with top tier customers with whom we've had relationships for an extended period of time. Approximately 75% of the total portfolio was in Canada. Our Canadian residential portfolio is well diversified: 55% to single-family residential construction and land development; 30% to high-rise condominium construction; and 15% to income producing properties.</p>
          <p>Our single-family residential construction and land development loans are to experienced long-term clients. Their projects have substantial pre-sales and are holding their value in today's market. For our condo construction loans, we require greater sponsorship equity and pre-sales in excess of 50% of the total project. Our loans to income producing properties are secured by new or well-maintained buildings in major urban centers. To date, our loan loss experienced has been 29 basis points on the entire portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the remainder of 2009, we believe the credit markets will continue to be challenging. Nevertheless, we are comfortable with how our portfolios are performing at this point in the credit cycle. As I said before, managing risk will remain our number one priority and we are proactively managing it and being prudent on our provisioning.</p>
          <p>We expect the provisions for the balance of the year to remain within our risk tolerances, particularly given the actions we are taking to mitigate risk. That concludes my comments on risk and I will now turn it back to Luc.</p>

          <p>Andre, it's Luc. The largest reduction relates to incentive compensation. On a six-month basis, six months of this year versus last year, it is in line with the increase in net income. We were probably a little too conservative in Q1 in terms of what we recorded.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your NPL formations were far above your provisions. And your net NPLs have now increased to more than 800 million from $279 million last quarter, while other banks have been provisioning in line with their formations. What comfort can you give us that you're not just putting off even higher provisions to the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question, Michael. You saw that if you look at gross impaired loan formations of approximately 600 million this quarter over half of that was in Scotia Capital. We had one as I mentioned in my comments commercial real estate finance company that we provisioned. The gross impaired loan is approximately $200 million. And we think that we provisioned early for this and we'll see how it unfolds in subsequent quarters.</p>
          <p>The other point I'd make on coverage ratios is we obviously monitor this very closely. And we look at it a number of different ways. As you can see, our coverage on specifics in terms of a percentage of gross impaired loans is approximately 40%, all allowances is around 79 or 80. And we look at this a couple of ways: one is we look at historically the loss given defaults going back 15 years on these portfolios in terms of are we adequately covered, and we're very comfortable in that regard.</p>
          <p>The other point I'd make is our general is 1.350 billion. And if you look at that compared to other generals on the Street, ours is basically a wholesaler general. We take care of the retail general through our roll rate methodology. So, that's a significant general for a wholesale business. So my concluding comment is we monitor this every quarter and we think we are more than adequately covered.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Brian just taking you back to your wholesale auto portfolio slide, I believe I heard you say that the remaining OEM exposure is GM and Ford. Can we assume that the sectoral provisions booked is basically against that line and can you give us a little bit of color in terms of how you arrived at 60 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question as well. Look, on our exposure to the two OEMs, we're obviously senior in terms of the total debt structure. Shat we're looking at is we're looking at the &#x2013; at our total auto exposure OEMs, parts, finance companies, the dealer floor planning business et cetera. And given the fluidity in the industry right now we've got one company in bankruptcy proceedings and soon to have another. What are the systemic impacts through the parts supply chain, through the dealer community et cetera? So we felt it was prudent again to provision upfront, and get ahead of the curve on it. I will say that we've done a lot of work on this from our dealer floor planning exposure, which is about 2.9 billion, the total amount of GM dealers closing in Canada, our exposure as a bank including Saturn, Saab and GM is about 33 names and our total exposure on a floor planning basis would be $40 million. And we think that's very manageable and we don't expect any sizable losses there at all.</p>

On the equity side I think our view has to be sort of tempered by a view of what the markets are going to do in the future and there is some prospect there for further losses on the equity side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. For Brian Porter, looking at the $40 billion International Commercial portfolio, if I look at this it looks like 10% of the portfolio is allocated to Peru. Yet you flagged that line or that country for the recoveries that we've been seeing. I've been surprised at how long these recoveries have continued. Could you maybe give us a little bit more detail on what is it in Peru, what area that is responsible for the recoveries and maybe how some of the other pieces of the portfolio by geography are performing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'm happy to do that. When you look at Peru generally, as you know, when we made the acquisition down there, we had &#x2013; there's $1 billion of bad loans. So we've been able to harvest those over time and we've been working hard to get recoveries there. We've also had some recoveries on our commercial portfolio, although smaller in Chile in the last quarter. But Peru as an economy, given all the areas we operate, Peru and Chile would be two of the better economies and they've been buffeted by &#x2013; somewhat in terms of the recovery in commodity prices, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But if you talk about the International Commercial portfolio and the risks we were monitoring, I said in my comments is we're comfortable with the commercial portfolios in Peru and Chile. Mexico, our exposure to the hospitality industry would be approximately $200 million spread across ten names and we are watching for the impact of the swine flu on that portfolio. We stressed it, and obviously it's manageable given its size. The Caribbean would be an area that we continue to monitor aggressively. We've got two hotels in the Caribbean that for a variety of reasons that we think may be classified in the next couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be able to tell us what the recovery for Peru specifically was, since it sounds like maybe the other areas of the book are in provisions and Peru's, that harvesting of that 1 billion in bad loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a variety of businesses. These are small recoveries we're harvesting from a big portfolio. There's no one specific industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can sneak in one for Luc or maybe for you again Brian, that Mexico recovery that you itemized, was this at your discretion? I think you used the term it was no longer required. You mentioned the swine flu a few times. It seems like if it was a discretionary action that it doesn't &#x2013; given your comments on the swine flu I would be surprised if it was discretionary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was discretionary. It relates to the initial increase acquisition in Mexico back several, several years and it was a provision that was set up at that point, Sumit, and it's no longer required.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. If we could revisit the expense type question that Andre had. The reduction in capital markets expenses of Scotia Capital expenses, Luc you said that it doesn't relate so much to revenue, and I guess that makes sense because revenues were up about 57% as you indicated on slide 17 but rather income in Scotia Capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Scotia Capital income year-to-date, the numbers are right there, $628 million year-to-date, 446 million last year, year-to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So income also up pretty significantly. So I guess I am still struggling with the explanation you offered to Andre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the reality is Mario that we had over, over accrued by a certain extent in Q1 and this was a really a true up for the six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So if we look at it on a six-month basis, six month earnings 2009, 628 million, six month earnings 2008, $446 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we &#x2013; the increased expense and accrual relating to incentive compensation for Scotia Capital has increased by the same amount of that net income increase year-over-year, six months, six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will -- another question, there was a lot of references to initiative spending curtailed in the quarter. Could you help us understand how much we are talking about there? What kind of savings was that in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The initiatives really I think to a certain extent was just a deferral to see what the revenues would come in at. That wasn't the largest saving in the quarter. It wouldn't be a huge number overall. The major savings were on things like advertising, travel, training et cetera but not, not other initiatives.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, a question for Brian Porter, please. Brian you mentioned that VaR was down in the quarter. I think you were speaking about year-over-year if I look at slide, I believe it's 51 of the sub-pack, VaR looked around flat for the quarter. However market risk is up about 15% sequentially. So I often think of there being a reasonable linkage there between VaR and market risk. So maybe you could us some give additional color on <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's the difference between average and spot in the VaR, but VaR is generally down and that's a function of credit spreads tightening and just better a tone in the end markets generally. Don't know if that answers -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One other just quick housekeeping question. It was mentioned that securitization revenues were a big driver in the Other segment. Are all the securitization revenues booked through Other or is some of it in Scotia capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No they're all booked through Others and they're retail securitized mortgages which are generally speaking in the Canadian Banking buck. There is no impact on the Canadian Banking. The whole impact is in the Other category, Canadian Banking is oblivious to the securitization and that's because it is controlled by treasury who is responsible for the funding the securitization is a funding initiative.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. A question on slide 12, the higher net interest margin, you mentioned favorable change in fair value financial instruments. I wonder if you can maybe provide details on what exactly that was, maybe par so how much of an impact that had on the improvement, and whether or not that will have an impact going forward in light of or would it create volatility in the margin going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darko, it's Luc. You saw that we had a dip in the previous quarter in terms of our margin. That was negatively impacted by financial instruments. So this quarter, all bank at the total net interest income level it was positive accounting for financial instruments of approximately $60 million. The previous quarter was negative 120 or so. So you had a major swing quarter-over-quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And if I can just sneak one more in, it's been a bit of a crazy day. I guess I missed the explanation for the high tax rate. Can you give us an idea as to why your tax rate was higher in the quarter and what should we expect going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate is higher this quarter is simply because we had lower income in low tax jurisdictions. We also had lower tax-exempt income this quarter. Looking forward, more of our income is coming from the higher tax jurisdictions. I would estimate that the tax rate for the year would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 21 to 24%.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Most of my questions have been asked. Just wanted to refer to the capital ratio. I know you have been able to bump it up after the quarter to just under 10% but it looks like the bar continues to get raised and we are seeing some of the other banks' operations approaching 11% and the TCE ratios significantly higher as well. Rick can you talk about the capital adequacy you feel you have at the bank or do you feel that risk weighted assets will be tumbling over the next couple of quarters to kind of help in that perspective of leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is a dynamic ratio, and risk-weighted assets, while we are certainly looking to book good quality ones on and it will be subject to demand, and then making sure the quality is there. So I think the big growth rates on the asset side are behind us and in fact now that capital markets have opened up and particularly the bond market, we are seeing and that is by the way great for credit quality, but the &#x2013; and what is happening is many of them are now repaying their bank loans and their short-term bank loans with long-term capital, and so we anticipate that that trend is going to continue and risk-based assets will go down. And so, that's on that side of the equation.</p>
          <p>On the actual capital box, we feel very, very comfortable with our capital ratios. Yes many of our competitors and especially the international, but in the Canadian have &#x2013; are going higher. We're comfortable for about three reasons. One, the quality of our assets, I think are still fine and we are very comfortable with that. The quality of our capital, the fact that despite substantial model our capital is tangible net worth, where we are industry leading in terms of the tangible. Three but most importantly I think we had probably the highest return on equity or at least one of the highest returns on equity of a bank certainly in Canada and around the world. And that allows us to have significant internal generation which is the best kind of capital, and that continues. And while we do pay out the dividend and it is well covered, we are certainly earning substantially more than we are paying out. And so when you put all of that together and I guess lastly, as has been evident we do feel there's with our name and we do have access if we need it. And we don't feel that there's any need, we're well below &#x2013; above rather the regulatory ratios, and have felt very little pressure from markets in that to do other than make sure we remain adequately capitalized which we are.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Rick just following on that question, what's the bank's appetite to do deals internationally? It would seem to me that there would be opportunities developing for the bank to deploy capital.</p>

          <p>In the last 18 months and two years I have seen huge amount of opportunities, and they will continue. But we will use the discipline. We've done a little tuck-ins and we increased a bit in Thailand. And so we see our internal growth is just fine and our options are there. So we're going to be disciplined. So I don't see it high on the radar screen. I think in my broad comments at the beginning in terms of the challenges that are out there in a lot of the markets, though, we'll never say never, but I don't think it's high on our probability scale.</p>
