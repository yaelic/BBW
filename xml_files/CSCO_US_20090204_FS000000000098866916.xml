          <p>Blair, thank you very much. During the opening comments of this conference call, I will focus on what I view to be the key takeaways for Q2 fiscal year 2009: first, a very candid discussion about what we have seen in the market on a global basis relative to Q2 and its effect on our Q3 expectations; second, an update given the current economic challenges and how we are number one reducing expenses, number two, prioritizing our many opportunities for the future, as well as how we are realigning resources as it relates to emerging markets, new market adjacencies, and emerging technologies.</p>
          <p>Third is a focus on our six-point plan for economic challenges and why we continue to be comfortable with our long-term growth goals of 12 to 17%, assuming that the global economy returns to normal growth rates; and then finally, our revenue guidance for Q3 with the appropriate caveats.</p>
          <p>Frank will follow these opening comments with additional detail on Q2 fiscal year 2009. The third section of the call will focus on business momentum and strategy from a geographic, customer segment, and a product basis. Frank will then follow with some additional financial parameters around our guidance. I will wrap it up with some comments in terms of Cisco's momentum going into Q3, and finally our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Q2 FY '09 was a solid quarter for Cisco from a revenue and an earnings perspective given the many challenges that we are all seeing occur in the global marketplace. In terms of those areas that we can control or influence, we continue to feel very comfortable with our long-term vision and differentiated strategy as we move into new market adjacencies and prioritize our existing opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our organization structure leverages the power of communities of interest, which we call councils, which we believe are $10 billion opportunities, boards that we see as $1 billion opportunities, and working groups. These organization structures allow us to more effectively prioritize resources across over two dozen cross-functional opportunities as well as within each of our corporate functions.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with our progress in aggressively managing our expenses while at the same time aligning resources to where we think Cisco can gain share and differentiate ourselves in the future. We exit Q2 with a compelling financial position and an innovation engine from both a product and a business model perspective that should allow us to continue to be a leader in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The following is a quick snapshot of both our financial highlights and innovation position. First, Cisco generated 3.2 billion in cash in Q2, resulting in cash and investments of approximately $29.5 billion. This is the second highest level of cash flow from operations in any quarter; second, solid balance from a product, geographic, and customer segment perspective, perhaps one of the broadest balances across the IT industry; third, continued success in being the number one or number two player in most of our 20-plus targeted product areas; fourth, an innovation engine that results in broad product leadership across the entire range of products that we've had in our history, architected from the home to the data center, across our enterprise, commercial, consumer, and service provider market segments.</p>
          <p>We believe this product pipeline across almost all of our existing and new priorities is the strongest we've ever had.</p>
          <p>Not only is our architecture across any combination of networks enabling the next generation of productivity, entertainment, and business models, but we believe we have the strongest position in terms of customer relationships with enterprise, government, service provider, and channel partners in helping enable our customers' goals.</p>
          <p>For example, last week in trips across emerging markets, key customer events, and at the World Economic Forum where I met personally with over 100 customers on an individual basis, the consistent feedback was that Cisco is dramatically expanding our value to these customers across all the above mentioned market segments on a global basis from both a technology and a business partnership perspective.</p>
          <p>Many of these customers also stated their increasing preference for an end-to-end player with product leadership strength as well as financial strength and staying power that Cisco represents.</p>
          <p>Just as we led in the first phase of the Internet; i.e. Web 1.0, from both an internal utilization and the expertise we offer our customers to enable this capability, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to provide very similar leadership in the second phase of the Internet, to collaboration enabled by network Web 2.0 technologies. Once again, we are leading in terms of our own utilization and partnering with our customers to drive their goals of changing business models enabled by the network.</p>
          <p>Our internal utilization of collaboration and Web 2.0 is exploding and loading networks aggressively. We will share some of the detail with you later on the call, but we do believe that the same phenomenon will occur in our customers' environments in the next several years.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to a summary of our Q2 financials, while year-over-year comparisons show that we are not immune to the challenging economic environment, I am very pleased with our continued strong profitability and ongoing cash generation, which provides us the flexibility to be agile and differentiate ourselves during this difficult period.</p>
          <p>Revenue was 9.1 billion, a 7.5% year-over-year decrease. Cash generated from operations was 3.2 billion, bringing our total cash plus investments to approximately 29.5 billion, which I think is the highest in the high-tech industry.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP EPS were $0.32, down 16% year over year. And GAAP EPS was $0.26, a 21% decrease year over year. Total non-GAAP gross margins were 64.0%, a decrease from 65.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for Q2 were 38.7%, declining 178 million or approximately 5% quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>Our early stage internal startups that we call emerging technologies were also solid in Q2 in terms of year-over-year order growth. Our strategy is to develop a reasonable percentage of these emerging technologies and do what we categorize as advanced technologies with the realistic possibility of becoming 1 billion plus in sales and the number one market position in their respective product categories. While these numbers are not financially material at this point in time, we believe that with the proper execution, they can become very significant to our growth rate in the long run.</p>
          <p>The emerging technology group orders in total grew approximately 48% year over year. The number of customers that ordered for example TelePresence systems is now 312 in total and grew by 65 new accounts in Q2.</p>
          <p>While growth in most of our countries around the world was challenging, we did see some year-over-year order growth from the mid-teens to the high 20s in the following countries: Mexico, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland. However, we did find that the majority of our large countries such as the U.S., UK, India, Russia, and Italy had negative order growth year over year in Q2. We will provide additional details on products, geographies, and customer segments later on the call.</p>
          <p>In summary, for those areas that we can control or influence, we feel we are doing a reasonably good job. The key market transitions relative to collaboration, virtualization, and visual networking which will drive productivity and grow the network loads for the next decade are evolving even faster than we thought one quarter ago. However, all of us are seeing the same financial and global economic challenges that have accelerated over the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>Our approach and underlying assumptions regarding our short-term strategy in the current environment have not changed. We start with a culture and a track record of using economic challenges to gain market and profit share as well as to move into new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>We do our best to be transparent with you in terms of what we are seeing in the market. For example, it was almost a year and a half ago when Cisco was among the first to indicate that we were seeing some challenges in orders from U.S. financial and some global accounts. It is now clear that we are in a global economic slowdown. And for the company that operates in over 160 countries worldwide, we will obviously be impacted.</p>
          <p>But if there's one lesson learned during the preceding economic challenges that Cisco faced in 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2003, it is the importance of rapidly positioning our company to not only weather the storm, but to lead as we inevitably come out of the downturn. We have traditionally done this extremely well and with the appropriate caveats believe that we have already positioned the company to do it once again.</p>
          <p>Time will tell if this confidence is justified. And as we mentioned earlier, we are already on track to overachieve our total expense reduction goal of at least $1 billion &#x2013; Frank, nice job by the team on that &#x2013; from our annual run rate. And we are well on our way to realigning an additional 500 million of resources based on careful prioritization of new growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We also want to use this call, as we've done in the past, to share very transparently what we are seeing in terms of order momentum and feedback from our customers, again, with all of the appropriate caveats that we could be wrong in our assumptions and strategies.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, we outlined our approach to the economic slowdown, and at this time we would like to give you an update on our progress. When we see these market transitions occurring, we go to our playbook for economic downturns, where there are four basic guidelines that we follow. The first guideline is to be realistic about the calls of your challenges; is it primarily the macroeconomic environment or your strategy. We believe that our long-term strategy is working extremely well and we will stay focused on its continued implementation.</p>
          <p>Second, determine the length and depth of the downturn and respond appropriately. As we were one of the first to discuss in our last quarter's conference call, we felt this downturn was occurring quicker and with more severity than many of our peers. The length of the downturn is still in question. And being very candid, no one, including us, really knows how long it will last. The majority of our customers are guessing 2010 while a smaller group sees the upturn toward the end of 2009. Given the coordinated activities of global central banks and the extremely large stimulus packages that are being implemented in almost all of our major countries, I tend to be a little bit more optimistic than most of my customers. Time will tell if that optimism is appropriate.</p>
          <p>Third, prepare for the upturn. We believe this is the time to differentiate ourselves from our peers and be aggressive in ways that will position Cisco for the future profitable growth and stronger market share leadership. This is the area that I believe we can uniquely position Cisco with our process driven vision, differentiation strategy, and execution, combined with our organizational structure around councils and boards that will allow us to move with speed, skill, flexibility, and with a replicatable process as this upturn inevitably occurs. I will provide additional details on how we're preparing for the upturn in a moment.</p>
          <p>Fourth, expanding customer relationships; we are attempting to move very rapidly across the majority of our service provider, enterprise, and government accounts to dramatically expand both the technology relationship as well as the business relationship as it relates to the customers' future growth and their own flexibility in managing through the downturn while preparing for the upturn.</p>
          <p>There is an increasing interest and understanding of the value Cisco can bring to these customers in both managing through the downturn as well as preparing for the upturn and catching the next wave of both business models and productivity. It is very important to understand our focus on resource prioritization and realignment as we aggressively move into market adjacencies during this downturn as compared to prior economic downturns.</p>
          <p>In short, this time it is different. In 2001, for example, we were at the end of a decade long run on product cycles, productivity, and business model changes enabled by the first phase of the Internet. And unfortunately, our six advanced technology investments at that time were at least three to five years away from being significant in terms of financial results.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we are almost in the exact opposite scenario. Our new product pipeline is extremely strong, and most of the market adjacencies that we're entering have the potential to be material in the next two to three years. Just as we have done in prior challenges, and as we discussed in last quarter's conference call, we have also implemented a game plan for dealing with these challenges. This game plan for the current downturn is called our six-point plan.</p>
          <p>In the six-point plan, point one is, we will drive every major element of our resource prioritization: new products, market adjacencies, decisions through our vision, differentiated strategy, and execution model. First, we believe our vision of how the industry will evolve is being driven by the increasing role of intelligent networks will play and all forms of communication and IT is enabled by the network. This transition is occurring as we expected.</p>
          <p>Our differentiated strategy enabled by network, collaboration, and the products playing together over time in a tightly architectured structure is allowing us to move into market adjacencies with tremendous speed, skill, and flexibility. Cisco will remain focused on both the technology and the business architectures to enable our customer objectives.</p>
          <p>In short, our vision, strategy, and execution is working well and we plan to stay focused on continuing to expand this approach.</p>
          <p>Second, collaboration and Web 2.0 driving future growth and productivity; we will continue our rapid expansion of collaboration technologies and new business models in both our product architectures and our own internal IT implementation. We plan to continue to quickly realign resources to focus on over two dozen market adjacencies that will loosely then tightly come together with our core technologies. Our goal is to be the best example of using Web 2.0 technologies such as TelePresence, WebEx, wikis, blogs, discussion forums, CiscoVision, communities, et cetera in an architectural process driven approach that drives productivity and new business models.</p>
          <p>I cannot overemphasize the importance of any device to any content over any combination of networks enabled by Cisco's technology and architecture approach, but also the importance that video will play in not only bringing communications to light but also in loading networks, what we call visual networking.</p>
          <p>Resource management and realignment; through our councils and board structures, we have already realigned over 500 million of resources to these opportunities, and we expect to realign another 500 million by the end of fiscal year '09. We have successfully identified these opportunities, the resources required, and the timeline. While we believe the some of the opportunities will have short-term impact for the next six to twelve months, most are strategic investments that we believe will position us for the long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Many actions we took this quarter, including our continuing hiring pause along with a significant amount of non-head count related expense reductions, which Frank will provide more detail on later, led to a 15% decrease in our discretionary operating expenses in Q2 FY '09 compared to the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we'll be aggressive in our strategy, prioritize, and execute. We will also be bold in taking good business risks during this downturn to build up our market transitions, opportunities, and put our many assets to use in existing and new markets as the recovery occurs.</p>
          <p>I will attempt to briefly summarize both the approach as well as the required resource prioritization as we move aggressively into new markets. Step one, we are prioritizing our top five opportunities for the entire company and making sure that they are properly resourced. These top five priority opportunities are next generation company and next generation customer relationships or what we call internally Cisco 3.0; second, collaboration/Web 2.0; third, video, visual networking; fourth, data center and virtualization, and fifth, globalization.</p>
          <p>While we will continue to gradually decrease our total operating expenses, we will be aggressive in both realigning and incremental funding based upon future growth opportunities. And then as a third step, we will utilize our strong balance sheet to support our resource realignment, investment, and acquisition strategy, as we broaden our portfolio and continue to fund our conservative but strategic financing arm of Cisco Capital.</p>
          <p>Fifth, investment in the U.S. and selected emerging countries; we intend to invest aggressively in two geographic categories, the U.S. and selected emerging countries. In our opinion, the U.S. will be the first major country to recover. Therefore, we will make many of our market adjacency investments in the U.S. We must gain from this economic pain that we are currently experiencing. This downturn in my opinion is both the biggest challenge of our lifetime, but also represents the biggest opportunity to transform our company as well as our economy through a series of bold steps.</p>
          <p>As a nation, we spent the last decade helping other countries embed smart infrastructure and now we need to invest in leading technology infrastructures that can become the basis for our economic recovery, future productivity gains, and standard of living improvement for the majority of Americans. We believe we can transform our nation and spur our economy with smart digital infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Smart digital infrastructure will have a profound impact on healthcare, energy, broadband, and education. In each of these areas, the role of government and business leaders must not only be to transform, but also must evolve into collaborative structures to achieve benefits for the country. Business must evolve, future business models must reflect global connectedness, but also a collaborative evolution in business structures which move away from the traditional hierarchy of command and control models. Leadership will be based upon innovation and operational excellence.</p>
          <p>At the same time, it is important to realize that we are connected to the environment for global growth. And perhaps for the first time through network technology as well as public-private partnerships, we have the potential to meaningfully impact over 3 billion people in the world making less than $3 a day. It is something that should be a major disappointment to us all that we have not been able to more effectively address this global challenge.</p>
          <p>We also believe countries like China and India are the best positioned among the emerging country peers to minimize the effect of the global challenges on their own economies. We are also optimistic that we will continue to see strong support by many governments around the world to minimize the effect of these major challenges. Therefore, from the emerging countries focus, China and India will be in our first wave where we will continue to invest during the downturn.</p>
          <p>And just as we needed to prioritize in our market adjacencies, we need to do so in emerging markets. There will be a second wave of emerging countries that we will focus on, including Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. And a third wave of approximately two dozen select countries out of the more than 100 emerging countries where we do business. The strategy on emerging countries is simple. Over time, we expect the majority of the world's GDP growth will come from the emerging countries. And expanding these relationships during tough times, our goal is to be uniquely positioned as the market turnaround occurs. This is very similar to what we did in Asia's 1997 financial crisis.</p>
          <p>Fifth, power of the network as a platform driving the future of commutations and IT; finally, we will remain focused on our stretch goal of evolving into the top communications and IT company, which will be enabled by the expanding role of intelligent networks. This could be the definition of a very successful implementation of our six-point plan after the inevitable upturn occurs.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to give you some additional data and customer feedback for you to understand why we are continuing to move rapidly to realign our cost structure and prioritize our investments after a reasonable Q2 fiscal year 2009. There were a number of positives in the quarter such as our financial results, balanced product revenue, advanced technologies, and solid momentum from some of our developed and emerging geographies. As we discussed last quarter, at that point in time the U.S. and Western Europe were seeing the most challenges from our customers' point of view regarding the health of their business and their own orders. However, this challenge has now spread across all countries around the word.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, what we said on last quarter's conference call regarding challenges across the industry segments did continue. Customers not just in the financial, automotive, and retail sectors, but across most of our enterprise, commercial, and service provider customers faced what they view as a very major challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>While we would not normally provide monthly product order growth rates, we believe that during uncertain times, we should share very openly what we are seeing. Total year-over-year product order growth continued to deteriorate throughout the quarter. For example, order growth in November decreased by 9% year over year. In December, our order growth decreased by 11% year over year for products. And in January, our year-over-year order growth decreased by approximately 20%. This order growth was normalized for the Thanksgiving and the end of year Christmas holidays. Overall for Q2, year-over-year product order growth decreased by 14%. While product revenue growth in Q2 decreased by 11%, book-to-billed was slightly below one.</p>
          <p>In summary, just as we were one of the first high-tech companies to report our quarter that included October, the challenges we saw in the U.S. as discussed in our Q1 call has spread globally. The environment has continued to change dramatically in the last several months. It is important to note that Cisco is different than many of our peers and that approximately 80% of our business is non-recurring each quarter, and therefore is a reasonably good indicator of spending patterns.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our balance across all major geographies, four major customer segments, and over two dozen product families normally works to our advantage. But when you are the number one player in many of these categories and the slowdown is truly going global across these industry segments, geographies, and product families, we will obviously be impacted.</p>
          <p>It has been very difficult given all the uncertainties going on in the market to provide a forecast given the dramatic variability, and it continues to be one of the most difficult times in my career in terms of my comfort level with a forecast. It would not be a major surprise to see the numbers vary on either the positive or negative side of revenue guidance that we will provide for Q3. With that being said, I still believe that providing some level of guidance is the appropriate thing to do for transparency and for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As we have said in conference calls over many years, Cisco has always been affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC reports. For the purpose of our long-range goals as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate and that we will effectively execute on that vision.</p>
          <p>In providing our revenue guidance for Q3 fiscal year '09, we are going to assume that what we saw in terms of order momentum challenges, especially in January, will continue into the next quarter. This is also what we are hearing from our global customers, our field forecasts for the next quarter, and our feedback that I received and others received from customers in the last several months, especially at the World Economic Forum last week.</p>
          <p>With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q3 fiscal year 2009, including our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, is for revenue to decrease in the 15 to 20% range year over year. Again as a reminder, during each of the past economic slowdowns, Cisco has always navigated very effectively through difficult times to expand our share of our customer spend while moving aggressively into new market adjacencies. As a result, we were better positioned coming out of the transition versus our peers. This strategy served us well during the last downturn when our strategic investments resulted in our advanced technologies segment today, which represents approximately 25% of our product business.</p>
          <p>As we approach both the opportunities and challenges in front of us, we bring a very experienced and broad leadership team that has been through these challenges together over the last decade. We also bring a culture that adjusts very quickly to changes and has consistently continued to execute effectively regardless of the opportunities or challenges; as we have done before, leveraging market slowdowns to move into many new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>While we all wish these challenges would not occur, it is during these times that we have consistently gained the confidence of our customers, partners, shareholders, and employees to be even stronger versus our peers following these challenges.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe that we are well positioned in the industry from a vision, differentiated strategy, and execution perspective. We believe that we are entering the next phase of the Internet to grow and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by network-enabled Web 2.0 technologies.</p>
          <p>We will do our best to provide product architectures and the expertise to help our customers in the implementation of these collaborative capabilities from a technology and a business perspective. We will also share with our customers how we've done this internally. In short, we're going to attempt to execute a strategy over the next decade that's similar to what we did in the early '90s. And as we said before, it powered our growth for the next decade, except for the obvious difference of being a company that now has a run rate of approximately $36 billion per year and over 67,000 employees focused on these opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, Frank, let me turn it over to you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, John. For today's call, I will provide a recap of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, and will then discuss why I firmly believe our financial strengths, portfolio diversification, and speed of execution helps us navigate market transitions and continues to position us well for the upturn.</p>
          <p>Total revenue for the first quarter was $9.1 billion, a decrease of 7.5% year over year, well within our guidance for the quarter of minus 5 to 10%. Total service revenue was $1.7 billion, up approximately 10% year over year, with solid growth across our geographic theaters. Services revenue and our recurring product revenue stream, primarily from WebEx and IronPort businesses, represented approximately 20% of our total revenue mix this quarter. Total product revenue was $7.3 billion, down approximately 11% year over year.</p>
          <p>Switching revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of 11% year over year, while routing revenue was $1.5 billion, down 23% year over year. Advanced technologies revenue totaled $2.4 billion, representing an increase of 1% year over year, with good performance in video systems with growth of approximately 18% year over year. We also saw growth in security of approximately 2% and application networking services of approximately 1%.</p>
          <p>Unified Communications declined by approximately 5% year over year, and Home Networking declined by 11% year over year. Other product revenue totaled $415 million, a decrease of 22% year over year, related in part to our optical and cable businesses this quarter.</p>
          <p>Total year-over-year revenue growth by geography ranged from up 1% year over year in both Japan and European markets to down approximately 12% in Asia-Pacific. Revenue in emerging markets theater decreased by 11%. And in the United States and Canada, revenue decreased by approximately 9% year over year.</p>
          <p>In a difficult economic climate such as this, the continuing strength of our financial model enabled us to manage our gross margin levels. Q2 total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.0%, in line with our guidance, down 1.6% points quarter over quarter and 1.2 points year over year. For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 63.6%, down 2.6 points quarter over quarter and down 2.2 percentage points year over year. The quarter-over-quarter decline was driven by lower volume, product mix, and other manufacturing related costs. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower volume, higher product discounts and pricing, product mix, partially offset by cost savings.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP service margin for the second quarter was 65.7%, up from 62.4% last quarter and 61.8% in Q2 fiscal year '08. This was driven by strong margins from both our technical support and advanced services and a more favorable services mix. Service margin will typically experience some variability over time due to various factors such as the changes in mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of contract initiations and renewals.</p>
          <p>Total gross margin by geography ranged from 59.5% for emerging markets to 70.3% in Japan. In the U.S. and Canada and Asia-Pacific, our margins were relatively in line with the overall company's gross margin. In emerging markets, gross margins were 59.5% where we did see a decrease quarter over quarter in theater, reflecting lower volume and additional reserves, consistent with our conservative accounting practices. We did see gross margins improve on a quarter-by-quarter basis, both in our European markets and Japan.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expense were $3.5 billion in Q2 fiscal year '09, down from $3.7 billion in Q1 fiscal year '09, representing a 5% reduction quarter over quarter. As we announced last quarter, we have been managing to our target of removing $1 billion from our annual run rate by Q4 fiscal year '09. Based upon our diligent focus and the speed of our execution on this effort in Q2, I firmly believe we are on track to exceed this target. I am pleased that our expense management performance drove discretionary spend down 15% quarter over quarter by reductions in our travel and outside services. I would like to thank the employees of Cisco for delivering these notable results.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately 38.7% in Q2 fiscal year '09 versus 35.7% in Q2 fiscal year '08. The foreign exchange benefit on a year-over-year basis was $95 million.</p>
          <p>Interest and other income was $95 million for Q2, which reflects lower net interest income as a function of lower market interest rates. Our diversified, high-quality cash and investments portfolio continued to perform well within the challenging financial markets with relatively minor asset impairments. I will provide more detail on our investment portfolio in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our Q2 fiscal year '09 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%, consistent with Q1 fiscal year '09 and our expectations.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 was $1.9 billion, representing a decline of 22% year over year. As a percentage of revenue, net income was 21%, a strong performance in this market.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter were $0.32 per share versus $0.38 per share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, which represents a 16% decline year over year. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $1.5 billion, as compared to $2.1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the second quarter were $0.26 per share versus $0.33 per share in the same quarter of fiscal year 2008.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the balance sheet, in this difficult macroeconomic environment, we are also pleased with our historically solid balance sheet and how we continue to further strengthen our key balance sheet metrics as I will highlight shortly.</p>
          <p>The total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q2 were $29.5 billion, up from 2.8 billion (sic) [26.8 billion] in Q1 fiscal year '09. Of this total balance, 3.2 billion was held within the United States.</p>
          <p>During Q2, we generated $3.2 billion in cash flow from operations. This represents near record operating cash flow, even in a very tough environment, and our second highest cash flow quarter ever for Cisco.</p>
          <p>Moving on to accounts receivable, we reduced our receivables 12% from Q1 fiscal year '09 with a remaining balance of $2.9 billion. We remain very pleased with the quality of our receivables portfolio. At the end of Q2, days sales outstanding or DSO was 29 days, which was flat compared to Q1 fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>Total inventory at the end of Q2 was $1.1 billion, a reduction of approximately $100 million quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.3 this quarter, relatively flat quarter over quarter and up 0.7 point from Q2 of last year. Our inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q2 were $2.7 billion, a 6% reduction from the end of Q1 fiscal year '09.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we repurchased $600 million of common stock or 37 million shares of our stock at an average price of $16.40 per share. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.8 billion remaining in the current stock repurchase authorization.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was $9.3 billion at the end of Q2 fiscal year '09, an increase of approximately 16% year over year. Deferred product revenue was $3.2 billion, up approximately 20% from last year, while deferred service revenue was $6.1 billion, up approximately 15% year over year.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q2, our head count totaled 67,318, a net decrease of approximately 329 from the end of Q1. In mid-October, we did implement a pause in our external hiring and we have continued that throughout this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to discuss how we are managing Cisco's financial position and why we believe this gives us a competitive advantage and strengthens our ability to lead in the future. We believe our vision, strategy, and execution model will enable us to move into market adjacencies with tremendous speed, scale, and flexibility. With $29.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, a solid balance sheet, our Cisco Capital financing arm, and our robust portfolio of innovation, all of which provide a key competitive advantage, we believe we continue to be well positioned to compete effectively during the market downturn and thereafter take advantage of the market upturn when it does occur.</p>
          <p>Our conservative investment portfolio is invested in securities with an average credit rating of AA or better. Approximately 90% of our cash and fixed income portfolio is invested in cash or highest rated short-term A1+ or long-term AAA securities. An ongoing focus on dynamic risk mitigation has significantly strengthened the cash and fixed income portfolio for Cisco since the onset of the financial crisis. This has resulted in an immaterial mark-to-market impact on our portfolio valuation in absolute terms when compared to last quarter.</p>
          <p>Continued diligent focus on our accounts receivables, supply chain, and ongoing review of excess and obsolete inventory has delivered positive results again this quarter. As stated earlier, key metrics such as inventory turns, the level of purchase commitment, and DSO remain strong and contribute to Cisco's consistent performance.</p>
          <p>Our financing arm, Cisco Capital, continues to provide financing to our customers and channel partners, which enables incremental sales of Cisco's products, services, and networking solutions. In the first half of fiscal year '09, Cisco Capital originated or facilitated approximately $2.1 billion in lease and longer term loan arrangements.</p>
          <p>To update the numbers previously disclosed at Q2 fiscal year '09, we have a combined balance sheet and contingent liability position of approximately $4.4 billion. Of this $4.4 billion, we have a net reserve and deferred revenue position of $2.5 billion. This represents an overall reserve and revenue deferred position of over 50% of the financing portfolio position.</p>
          <p>We have continued to see positive payment behavior from our customers and we'll continue to monitor that closely, and believe there have been no material impacts to the quality of our portfolio. Broadly speaking, we believe our portfolio has on average an approximate investment grade profile, and we remain comfortable with the credit profile and the way we are deploying our capital.</p>
          <p>Robust portfolio management and continued technology innovation are also key contributors in our ability to move quickly and take advantage of market transitions. As we continue our expansion into new markets, we have the ability to quickly realign resources to accelerate our company priorities, first by freeing up resources and then by strategically applying them to the highest yielding business opportunities.</p>
          <p>In Q2 fiscal year '09, we committed a realignment approaching $500 million for the remainder of this fiscal year in existing talent and budget, basically to specific opportunities on our top five company priorities, which are virtualization, collaboration, video, globalization, and Cisco 3.0. This is a true realignment and balancing within our portfolio and is not an increase in resources.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have long stated that our financial management and position are a competitive advantage for Cisco. And that belief has been even further strengthened, even in light of the current economic condition. In one quarter's time, Cisco has realigned under $500 million into our growth areas and still managed to reduce our expense run rate. In fact, it is my strong belief our business model and financial position will provide us with two key capabilities, speed and flexibility. We have been able to minimize negative exposure to our business as well as position ourselves to take advantage of opportunities in this market because we can react quickly and leverage the flexible, profitable nature of our financial position.</p>
          <p>Through continued prudent expense management along with calculated investments in our highest yielding business opportunities through our resource realignment and portfolio management, I believe we will be able to balance the priorities of growth and profitability as we move through the current challenging economic environment. This will allow us to focus on the things that we believe will grow our company over the long term, capture these market transitions in our industry, emerge stronger, and enhance Cisco as a global and market leader. We think our proven execution speed, market knowledge, management experience, and our financial strength uniquely positions Cisco to continue as leaders of a network centric marketplace.</p>
          <p>I now turn this back over to John. John?</p>

          <p>Frank, thank you very much. At this time, I'd like to move on to the geographic, customer segment, product, and strategy review. First from a geographic point of view; in this section of the call, we will cover our geographies and then we will move on to customer segments and products for Q2 in more detail. The products review will be in revenue growth terms while the geographic and customer segments will be discussed in orders unless otherwise indicated.</p>
          <p>First from a geographic and customer segment point of view in terms of Q2 year-over-year order growth; in terms of our overall customer segment business, the public sector was a bright spot across all geographic markets. Total public sector order growth was in the mid-single digits and four of the five theaters had positive public sector growth. Enterprise and service provider were both down approximately 20% in terms of orders on a global basis. The commercial market was down in the high single digits from an orders perspective in Q2.</p>
          <p>On to Europe, given all the challenges that we have seen across Europe, we have been relatively pleased with our consistent performance. European markets in total were down approximately 5% year over year. The public sector and service provider both had positive growth in the mid-single digits. Enterprise was down in the mid-teens. Commercial was down in the high single digits. Germany was a very bright spot in Europe with growth in the high teens, while the UK and Italy both had a very tough quarter with order growth down over 20%.</p>
          <p>Japan order growth was down year over year in Q2 by approximately 4%. Public sector had a very strong quarter with growth of over 30%. Commercial was up in the mid-teens, while search provider was down approximately 20%. Enterprise was relatively flat.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Asia-Pacific; Asia-Pacific order growth was down 12% year over year. Specifically, China was down in the low single digits and India was down approximately 30% year over year. Public sector had order growth of 3% in Asia-Pacific. Enterprise was down in the mid-20s from an order perspective. Service provider was down approximately 12%, and commercial was down slightly.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the U.S.; for the U.S., orders in Q2 were down by approximately 18% year over year. Public sector growth was in the mid-single digits. Service provider was down approximately 30%. Enterprise was down in the high teens. Commercial was down in the low teens.</p>
          <p>Emerging market theater; emerging markets were down by 23% year over year. Within the emerging markets, enterprise was down 35%. Service providers were down approximately 30. Commercial was down by 10%, and public sector orders were down by approximately 6%.</p>
          <p>Now on to the products discussion; Q2 year-over-year product revenue growth was down approximately 11%. In spite of a difficult economy, we continue to drive technology innovation and product leadership from our core, advanced, and emerging technologies. The following is a summary of these areas for Q2 in terms of year-over-year product revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Core product revenues declined 15% year over year, with switching down 11% and routing down 23%. Services revenue increased by 10% year over year. Total advanced technology revenues grew approximately 1%. Video systems grew 18%, and it became the largest advanced technology in terms of quarterly revenue. Unified Communications was down 5%. Wireless was down approximately 6%. Security grew by 2%. Network Home decreased by 11%. Storage decreased by seven, and application networking services grew approximately 1%.</p>
          <p>The area that I consider the most interesting at this point in time is how quickly collaboration enabled by Web 2.0 is spreading across all of Cisco functions in a viral form with a very rapid takeup. With that in mind, I would like to share with you a brief snapshot as well as proof points as to how quickly the ramp of network Web 2.0 technology is occurring at Cisco in support of our business and organization goals.</p>
          <p>Over the last 12 months, our internal utilization of Web 2.0 has grown at a pace that was much faster than that at the first phase of the Internet that we experienced in the early '90s where we entered orders online and supported our customers virtually over the network.</p>
          <p>A sampling of some of these technologies where the internal ramp is almost in all cases dramatically exceeding the ramp we saw in the early '90s include the following, and this is literally in the last 12 months what the growth rate has been. The utilization of the collaboration enabled by WebEx is up 3,100%. TelePresence meetings, as I said earlier, averaging 4,000 a week, which enables not only new business models but also reduction in our travel expenses from a run rate of 750 million to the current run rate of approximately 350 million.</p>
          <p>Discussion forums are up approximately 1,600%. Cisco's C-Vision, our internal version of YouTube, is up 2,300%. All these together are leading our networks, even in today's challenging times, in a growth rate of over 400%, which obviously requires additional routers and switches to support the network demand.</p>
          <p>In summary from a vision, strategy, and execution perspective, although we would all like to avoid the downturns, our vision of how the industry is going to evolve appears to be playing out very much as we expected. We believe our differentiated strategy is also achieving the benefits to both Cisco and our customers that we thought were possible. And finally, our execution is on target in terms of the results as measured from a customer partnership perspective, market share, and share of our customers' total communications and IT expenditures as the network becomes the platform for delivering these capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now Frank, I'd like to turn it back over to you for additional detail of financial guidance and other financial highlights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review of our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. It is very difficult to provide a forecast given the dramatic variability and the uncertainties going on in the market. These events increase the potential that our actual results could vary materially from these expectations. Therefore, we anticipate total revenue for the third quarter to be down approximately minus 15% to minus 20% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>At this point, let me remind you that in light or Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you additional details on the Q3 financial guidance. As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, variable component cost, customer and channel mix, and also the competitive pricing pressure. That being said, we believe that our total gross margin in Q3 will be approximately 63%, reflecting the revenue guidance I just shared with you.</p>
          <p>We believe Q3 operating expenses will be approximately 40 to 42% of revenue. As you would expect in this environment, we are focused on aggressively managing our expenses through a pause in hiring, further decreasing travel and discretionary related expenses, as well as deferring certain capital related projects.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to reduce our expenses for FY '09 by over $1 billion from our annual run rate by Q4 of FY '09. This means we are targeting our Q4 '09 quarterly expense run rate to be reduced by about 250 to 300 million as compared to what we had in Q1 '09 at that quarterly expense run rate. I believe we are on track to exceed this target. While we will undertake appropriate expense management initiatives in the current environment, we will also make some calculated investments into areas where we believe we can accelerate development and Cisco's leadership. Our strategy in the current business environment is to align our resources to maximize growth opportunities and grow our market position while aggressively managing our expenses.</p>
          <p>Based on this realignment, there may be areas that we may deemphasize in order to move resources to high impact areas. As we deemphasize certain areas of our business, we expect to have some limited restructuring that may result in a loss of some job functions. These are actions that we normally see as part of our ongoing business management but may experience a higher amount of this activity in the near term.</p>
          <p>At this time, despite these actions, we are not planning any across the board workforce reductions. John will give you more specifics on this in his closing comments.</p>
          <p>We expect interest and other income to be approximately $80 million in the third quarter. Our tax provision rate for Q3 is expected to be approximately 22%.</p>
          <p>While we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it is difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding. We are modeling share count to be flat quarter over quarter for EPS purposes. In this estimate of share count, we are not taking into consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the third quarter of fiscal year '09.</p>
          <p>As a point of reference, a $1 movement in our average stock price would change the calculated shares outstanding for purposes of determining earnings per share by approximately 4 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash flow from operations, we would expect to generate 500 million to $700 million per month.</p>
          <p>For Q3 FY '09 GAAP earnings, we anticipate that Q3 GAAP EPS will be $0.05 a share to $0.07 per share lower than non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to acquisition-related charges and stock compensation expense. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call back over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you very much. The following is a summary of my view of Cisco's momentum and opportunities entering Q3 of fiscal year 2009. In areas that Cisco can control or influence our leadership from a product perspective, innovation, architecture, and operational execution continues to be solid.</p>
          <p>Balance in a very tough environment given the global challenges continues to be reasonable across our geographies, products, services, and customer segments. This balance normally works to our advantage when there is a slowdown in a product area, a customer segment, or one or two geographies. However, when you are often the number one player across these categories and the challenges truly go global across all these categories, it is almost impossible to avoid the impact.</p>
          <p>As we said before, even if the market slows, we don't see this changing our long-term growth opportunities if we execute the way we have in prior slowdowns, and assuming that the global economy recovers to GDP growth rates similar to those in the middle of the decade.</p>
          <p>As we continue into Q3 fiscal year 2009, we plan to aggressively invest in new and adjacent markets for the longer term. In terms of major areas where the momentum appears to be solid and even possibly gaining would be the following. Innovation and product leadership look very solid across our core technologies, first and second wave of advanced technologies, and our new emerging technologies.</p>
          <p>Second, collaboration and network enabled Web 2.0 is moving past the early adoption stage and slowly becoming mainstream. TelePresence would be one of the best examples of this acceptance.</p>
          <p>Third, speed, scale, and flexibility as well as replicatable capabilities are key as we move into new market adjacencies. Our vision, differentiated strategy, and execution process driven approach leverage collaboration and teamwork combined with our organizational structure of councils and boards is working very well.</p>
          <p>And fourth, emerging countries, long term inevitably both total GDP and GDP growth in emerging countries will outpace that of developed markets. Therefore, we will stay focused on our emerging country strategy. However, in the short term given the economic challenges, we will prioritize our countries into four groups as discussed earlier. Just like you build relationships with customers during tough times, the same is true with countries and we are very actively implementing this strategy during these challenging times.</p>
          <p>As we stated earlier, we do believe that the challenges that initially affected the U.S. have spread to all other countries in the world. On a global and U.S. basis, we see the same challenges and uncertainties from an economic, political, and capital spending perspective that many of you continue to witness.</p>
          <p>As we said in last quarter's conference call, one area that we watch very closely is service provider spending. And unfortunately, the concern we expressed last quarter turned out to be justified. However, in the long run with increasing loads on networks and the rapidly expanding role of video and other Web 2.0 technologies in both the business and the entertainment segment of the industry, service providers will in our opinion return to very solid growth markets for us. And as such, you will see us continue to invest with these strategic partners.</p>
          <p>One of the most important things you do during periods of uncertainty is to communicate in very open and transparent fashion with your shareholders, customers, and employees. We believe Cisco is very well positioned to capture new opportunities, due in large part to the importance the network plays in all forms of communications and IT as well as our process and organization structure built around collaboration. Our customers and even our shareholders are telling us that we are extremely well positioned for the long-term growth with an ability to move into new markets during the most challenging times.</p>
          <p>While we have always done what is necessary as an organization to ensure the long-term success of our company, we have come to the decision at this point in time that the realignment and restructuring of resources to new opportunities is the most effective way rather than a large scale across the board layoff to position us for the future. If business continues to change dramatically, we would obviously do what is necessary to bring our expense structure in line with revenues. If that is the case, layoffs could be necessary as they have been one time in the past.</p>
          <p>Also in the spirit of complete openness, we are constantly realigning and restructuring resources as part of our normal business process. As an example in fiscal year 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, we realigned and restructured approximately 1,000 jobs of a global workforce of 67,000 employees. With the speed we are now moving on so many fronts, we will continue this normal process, which in the near term could result in a reduction of 1,500 to 2,000 jobs. This is something we will continue to do both in good and challenging times. But I thought it was important to provide this level of detail especially to our employee family during these uncertain times.</p>
          <p>Many of you have asked us if we need to do a broad company layoff in order to manage our expenses. My own view is if you're going to do a layoff and we try everything possible to avoid them, it needs to be of critical mass to justify the loss of business momentum, impact on employees, and disruption in key projects. Being very transparent, our definition of a companywide layoff, if we had to do one, would most likely be at least 10% of our workforce.</p>
          <p>Let me be very specific here. In very direct terms, we are not going to consider a layoff at this point in time. And while there are no guarantees, we think the odds are reasonable that if we execute effectively as outlined in this call that we may be able to avoid large downsizing events.</p>
          <p>I am counting on the help of each Cisco family member to help us effectively realign our resources into the broad growth opportunities in order to potentially avoid the requirement of a broad layoff. And again, as the market continues to slow, we believe this will not dramatically change our long-term approach with a vision of how the industry will evolve and our differentiated strategy. In fact, we have under consideration the next wave of cross-functional priorities. And again, my challenge to the organization will not be for one or two products or market adjacencies but another dozen.</p>
          <p>From my viewpoint, long-term growth I believe is not our challenge. Rather, our challenge is prioritization of both the opportunities and the resource allocation during these challenging times that will allow us to achieve these long-term growth goals. In fact, it is our intent to expand our share of customer spend during these corrections as we have done in the past.</p>
          <p>We also believe that our opportunity to expand in our current markets and market adjacencies is actually increasing. This is true from the data center to the home market, from the service provider to the small business and consumer. Therefore, you will continue to see us invest aggressively where appropriate while maintaining our focus on the financial models.</p>
          <p>Once again, with our usual caveats as discussed earlier in our financial reports, our Q3 fiscal 2009 guidance is for year-over-year revenue to decrease in the 15 to 20% range. We believe our long-term growth opportunities remain in the 12 to 17% range, again assuming our usual caveats and global GDP growth. We will focus on what we can control and influence and attempt to position Cisco to gain momentum in market transitions, whether they are in industry consolidation, product transitions, market adjacency opportunities, or economic.</p>
          <p>In summary, for those areas that we can control or influence, we believe our vision, strategy, and execution are in great shape and producing results.</p>
          <p>As always, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, employees, and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transitions, and challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>Now Blair, let me turn it over to you.</p>

          <p>John, I wanted to ask you in addition to the obviously very difficult environment if you can comment on the competitive environment from the vantage point of first pricing, because it does seem that that was a factor in the declining margins from a year-over-year perspective, if I heard that correctly. And one of your competitors last week, Juniper, also commented on pricing potentially getting more difficult. So how much of that should we expect?</p>
          <p>And then related to that, one of your other broader competitors, HP, has announced some initiatives as far as what they call the Open Network ecosystem with some best-of-breed partners. How much is that playing into the competitive environment as well on top of the downturn that we're experiencing from an economic perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Simona, if you look at what is occurring in this economic slowdown, it's no different in terms of pricing pressure versus what we've seen before. The competitors each time have perhaps changed. We will always have a couple of large competitors and a couple medium size and small. And the good news is if you're in markets that are going to grow and be exciting, you will continue to see many peers around the world both focused on the market as our partners and as our competitors.</p>
          <p>If you look at the discounting pressures, and Frank alluded to it earlier, they are not out of line at all versus what we've traditionally seen. The gross margin decrease was due primarily to mix and to volume. And in the mix side of the house, whenever you have video numbers like we had, which if I remember right, Rick, were 18% year over year. That's set-top boxes, and that does have a major mix on it. I, like you, Simona, immediately went to the routing and switching products and looked up on them, and actually our gross margins in those product areas actually were in very good shape on this quarter. And without giving too much away &#x2013; Frank's giving me a steady line across the table, I think they were actually up slightly. So we've not seen dramatic changes there.</p>
          <p>We will face new competitors. Most of the time, competition comes at us from a price point of view, but we don't see anything dramatically different in this marketplace. And again, we do not focus on competition. We focus on market transitions, and that normally has served us pretty well. So I hope that answers your question, Simona.</p>

          <p>Next question will come from Jeff Evenson of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm wondering about your customers' IT budgets, both what your sense is for how their IT budgets are changing relative to their spending on your products, and also do you feel like your customers currently have a good sense for what their IT budgets are for 2009, or at least for the first half of the year, and when do they arrive at a firm budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, realizing that it will probably vary by customer segment, service providers are obviously different than enterprise, which are different than commercial and different than consumer. But if I were to look at it, the service provider budgets are the ones probably that over the long run I'm most comfortable with because those networks are going to load up videos there. We're getting closer to the service provider customers, and they're looking at new revenue opportunities and how we help them monetize the loads that are occurring on that, and I think we're positioned very well.</p>
          <p>They can hold up for a period of time, and I'm not sure if that's a quarter or two or how long it lasts, and you can run your networks hotter. But you have to at a point in time continue to spend there. They're looking flexibility-wise on how much impact the slowdown is going to have on that. And you are seeing, as we saw this quarter, a number of them kind of hesitate as they watch.</p>
          <p>In terms of the commercial marketplace, their budgets, it's very simple. When they feel good about the business, they spend. When they don't, they don't. So those are probably the best indications that we'd watch &#x2013; when you start to see an upturn is what occurs in the commercial marketplace.</p>
          <p>The enterprise budgets are probably like here at Cisco in some ways, and basically we're squeezing discretionary expenses pretty tight. I view that IT has an unlimited budget, but I take it from someone else. But even within that budget, we've been pretty careful, Frank, in terms of expenses that Rebecca has been making. And a certain amount of her budget is in place. And candidly, I hold flexibility at my level. That's a nice way of saying I think you're going to see IT budgets move during the course of the year. You'll probably see most of them if they're setting an entire year basis be relatively conservative, and then based upon how both their business goes and the return that we can show the customers the flexibility on that.</p>
          <p>So Jeff, it's not an easy answer, but that's as good a job as I can do in terms of what we're seeing in today's uncertain environment. A nice way of saying it would not surprise me to see them change and more likely on the upside than the downside as you get further in the year if the business turns up. I think they'll be set conservatively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will be from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it seems you're extrapolating the last month of orders for your guidance for the entire upcoming quarter. Recognizing you typically see orders improve month to month, are you considering the seasonal lift we see in March and April? And was there any noticeable change between the first half of January and the second half? And, John, do you feel fiscal Q3 is a bottom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boy, I wish I knew, Mark. I normally have a very good feel for markets and listen to the customers. My customers don't really know for sure. Most of them are being conservative, and that can almost be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as all of us understand. I personally believe that with this type of stimulus and candidly pretty effective implementation by central banks and governments around the world, it will be earlier than most people anticipate on the upturn. But again, I talk to all the economists. They don't know for that side.</p>
          <p>In terms of seasonality, Rick tracks those very tightly, but it's remarkable. The seasonality tends to always be there. The question is how much is the run rate off. But it's remarkably similar day by day and week by week. And once you take out &#x2013; if dates are different like the holidays, we track that very closely. So I think you'll see those trends stay, the only question is what's the growth rate off of those trends.</p>
          <p>In terms of the first half of January versus the second half of January, that'd be cutting it too fine, and I'd share it with you if I thought it were material. I don't think it is. I tend to watch the months and we watch the ramp rate of the months. And as we discussed before, the first month of a quarter is usually 25% or so of your business. It then usually ramps up into the 30s and then into the 40s. So you can do the math as you add up in terms of total. But in terms of January, it was probably a normal flow, if I were to look at it, but I don't think it would add value to split it out more than that. Thank you, Mark.</p>

          <p>Okay, next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos of UBS. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. John, I realize this is a sensitive topic and you provided a lot of information on the call. But I wanted to go back to the head count and OpEx discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to make sure I have this right, it looks like the company believes it can reduce OpEx by at least $1 billion on a quarterly &#x2013; on a run rate when we look at first quarter to fourth quarter, and that can be achieved by reducing head count by 1,500 to 2,000 and realignment. So I want to make sure that that's the goal there, I mean the numbers behind it.</p>
          <p>And my question is what &#x2013; let's say revenues stay depressed for a while. That level of head count reduction probably doesn't get you to an operating model that you would like. Is the assumption that revenues start growing again next year and you can avoid a broader reduction, and that's what you'll reassess at the end of the fiscal year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nikos, thank you very much for the clarification. We've already pretty well achieved the $1 billion run rate primarily through discretionary spending. If you watch the ramp, even though last quarter it was 3.7 on expenses, Frank, if I remember right, I think the run rate was actually 3.8. The fact that we did 3.5 already, you multiply that delta &#x2013; let's make my math easy, let's say it's a reduction of 250 million. You multiply that by four. We already have the $1 billion reduction.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue to drive that aggressively. We're going to continue to realign and restructure and continue to keep constructive pressure on that. So again, we're in a pretty good position in terms of expense management. And what is interesting and what we encourage our peers to do, when we reduce expenses this time, we're going to focus not on how do you put the brake on and then when things occur &#x2013; start to turn up, put the accelerator back on. A lot of the expenses will never come back. So our expense per employee on travel has gone from I think about 7,900 per employee down to a almost a run rate of 3,400 here within the next quarter. That will not come back. And so we basically are building models for the future in terms of its implementation.</p>
          <p>The second element, we're going to do a balancing act. We clearly have a number of market opportunities that I very much want to go into. Ned's got a good pipeline of investments, acquisitions. And I've noticed a bias lately, Ned, toward the consumer side and I'm sure that has nothing to do with your irresponsibility. But what I am sharing with you on that is we are going to be aggressive moving into that. But I'd expect to continue to keep very constructive expense pressure on, and that is both through the restructuring, and that obviously is incremental head count reductions as well as additional discretionary spending and realignment.</p>
          <p>But I don't lack for growth opportunities; I want to be very direct here. We will run this company for where we think we should be in terms of revenue growth, profitability, et cetera, and what's right for our shareholders in the longer term. So you won't see our strategy dramatically change on a month or quarterly basis. It would obviously adjust as I alluded to in the careful wording &#x2013; and thank you for understanding the sensitivity of it &#x2013; if we were to get surprised or if the market were to continue to deteriorate. But at the present time, we think we're in pretty good shape in terms of our expense management, our resource allocation, and we would not have said that on this call if we didn't have our arms around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, if I can just add one thing for Nikos; if you look at the guidance that we provided for the third quarter, that would assume an expense rate in the third quarter of about 3.35 billion. Just between what we had in Q1 at 3.7 down for that, that already takes out about 1.4 billion, so it shows in those two quarters. And if you go at the rates that we were truly at at 3.8, it really says that we've taken it down even further. So it clearly shows that there's been some aggressive reductions. And there is still a substantial amount of our expense that's tied to some of the non-resource related expense, which is what we're focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in simple terms, if you look at our expense run rate, which was what about 15 billion, Frank, overall? We're approaching a reduction in &#x2013; we might decide what to do of about 1.5 billion, and we clearly set in place a stretch goal there. We've already realigned 500 million and we're in the process over the next couple months of completing the realignment of another 500 million. That's a pretty dramatic resource realignment. Not many companies can do that on the breadth and depth of where we're headed. So it would be a balance, Nikos, and we will strike that balance. But I would read into it more a level of confidence of not doing a major layoff across the board rather than a hesitation the reverse way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick question for you on where you're focusing your near-term efforts more on the U.S. market along with a couple of the emerging markets, are you seeing anything in the U.S. market that leads you to believe or that makes you more comfortable that that's going to turn first or is it more just trying to play it was the first to feel the pain, you expect that it will be the first to turn up? And then secondly, once you do get the U.S. back, do you think the rest of the globe will follow on relatively quickly once the U.S. gets back on its feet for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair question. It's way more than first-in, first-out. We look at the response the government is doing, the action of the Fed. Candidly in my opinion, President Obama is off to a great start, and I think his economic team is world-class.</p>
          <p>The second is you look at their stimulus and their investment, a large part of that is going to be when consumers aren't spending and business isn't spending, it has got to be government. And a large part of those areas I think will be in infrastructure, smart digital highways, the capability to do healthcare and education differently. Obviously, Cisco hopes to earn our share of business as that occurs.</p>
          <p>Third, whether it is in the data center, smart grids, the entertainment sector, productivity, collaboration, Web 2.0, we see a lot of innovation occurring in our customers across the board in this area. So if you really look at the lot of the market adjacencies we're going into, we see a lot of opportunity there. And Ned, even when you did your consumer announcements in some of our areas of interest, it's the U.S. that often sees it first.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, we still continue to see business process innovation in emerging countries, and China and India I think will continue to be very aggressive within that scenario. So we'll try to strike a balance. Our logic here, John, is that we think the U.S. will be the most creative during this change. We'll obviously adjust if that doesn't occur, but it goes way beyond a feeling of pride and commitment to the U.S. We think the business will turn here first. And candidly, we think the plans look pretty constructive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on the pace, John, from there for the rest of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll see it follow. The U.S. is, unfortunately or fortunately, still the economic engine of the world. So I think as the U.S. comes out, it will have an impact. I actually think India and China are managing this downturn remarkably well.</p>
          <p>If you talk about countries that feel pretty confident about their ability even though I didn't like the numbers that we did in India, Rick, this quarter, I think actually the India business leaders, and I'll be over there next week for a week with them, we're pretty optimistic and dawvish about their approach and the Chinese have an ability to adjust very effectively.</p>
          <p>Rob, I'm going to ask you just to spend a moment also on what we've done over the last year and a half on public sector because while a number of people might suddenly start to focus with these incentive plans on the public sector, both in the U.S. but around the world, we've been pretty aggressive in terms of over the last 18 months restructuring your operation and other operations to focus more on public sector. Share with us a little bit what you're doing there and a little bit your thoughts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John; you already mentioned that public sector was one of the bright spots around the world. Especially in Europe and the U.S., we have seen continued investments in this area. In fact in the U.S., where we had a very successful federal sales model beginning this fiscal year, we shifted resources for state local education into that group, creating a new public sector organization. I think the timing was pretty good because we're pretty well aligned right now to the activities of the Obama government. We see opportunities with smart buildings. We're seeing opportunities with smart transportation, infrastructure, public safety and security, health information networks, and smart grids. So I think we've moved resources already and we're in pretty good shape to catch the upcoming spending, which we expect is going to help bolster the budgets of state and local jurisdictions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Now you also saw similar movement in Europe with Chris Dedicoat putting focus on the public sector, Owen doing the same, and Paul doing the same. So we're getting good at using these on a global basis. But in very simple terms, we've already started to move a pretty fair amount of resources in the field and in our other segments of the company, advanced services, et cetera, into government. So thank you very much, John.</p>

          <p>Your next question will be from Scott Coleman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. John, you started out your prepared remarks in part talking about the power of the platform, and have obviously spent time talking about moving into adjacent markets. There's been a number of press reports lately about Cisco moving into the server market, clearly a ripe opportunity for the company. I'm wondering how you balance that type of move with the partnership ecosystem that you've built over the years, particularly given increased competition and the challenging environment. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Scott, as you would expect, I'm not going to comment about products that we may or may not announce in the future. But to answer indirectly your question, we try to catch market transitions. And within the network becoming the platform, as you articulated and set me up for the question, so I'll try not to blow the answer, it's completely transparent where the movie you're watching is on your &#x2013; or the music you are listening to, Ned, like the CES announcement is on the individual device, if it's on the set-top, if it's on your PC, if it's in the service provider point of presence or their data centers or the content generation data centers or somewhere out in the world wide web, that is tailor-made for routing Cisco and networking.</p>
          <p>And so as you think about that occurring, we are going to move intelligence throughout every element of the network, security throughout every element of the network, storage into most of the elements, application capability into most of them. So you will see us be aggressive from the home through the data center. And we don't focus on standalone markets. We don't do standalone products. Ned won't do a standalone device. We won't do a standalone &#x2013; similar mentality within the data center. It's how it architecturally comes together.</p>
          <p>So if you look at what we did with the Nexus 5000 announcement and how we're going to evolve, it really speaks to a next generation of data centers in how we go after this market, a next generation series of partners, et cetera. And all the way down to the same concept, Ned, was in the consumer space, and I'm going to take this opportunity for you just to kind of weave these two together about interoperability of any device, any content in the home and what we're doing architectural-wise and maybe use the new product announcements you just did that were extremely well received at Consumer Electronics Show. I'll brag on Ned and then give him the ball.</p>
          <p>Many people thought that we did Linksys through an acquisition and then Scientific Atlanta with set-top boxes, but weren't sure we could really play in the consumer market. In this Consumer Electronics Show here of just a couple weeks ago, we received more press than any other player except Microsoft in number of stories written, et cetera. We won a number of the consumer new product announcements and directions. But again, these are not standalone devices. It's how we share any device to any content, data, voice, video, wire to wireless. So Ned?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, John. Thanks very much. So as you point out, I think what we're seeing very simply, and this is driven as we look at all of our strategies, John, by the customer &#x2013; in this case the consumer &#x2013; that the consumer demand is shifting from point products and point applications to what we refer to as the media enabled home, the ability to connect all of their devices together and be able to share and experience their content and media across all of those devices equally, and the network is exceptionally well positioned to be able to be the platform to enable that to happen.</p>
          <p>So when you look at the announcements we made at CES, specifically our media hub platform, which opens up media for the first time to be shared seamlessly across devices connected to the network, both within the home and outside the home, as well as our partnership around connected devices and opening up the technology on the network to enable consumer electronics companies to connect &#x2013; enable their consumers to connect easily and provision easily to the network, we have the opportunity to really drive that network platform, and it really is an architectural approach, as we've always talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's exciting here, Scott, is that it's much what we've seen before. When the network becomes a platform, it opens up a whole new set of applications, business models, directions. And what we've seen in the past is it makes the market bigger for all of us. I think there's some peers who will tend to focus on the device level and say this is my territory and you're in my territory. We've never done that versus our peers, and we're not going to do it forward. We think the pie will get dramatically bigger. We'd like a smaller piece of the pie, but we think it's going to be a lot bigger revenue-wise than what you would get. And I think that comes with us coming out of the Internet background.</p>
          <p>Now, because we had so much material to cover today and we wanted to be very specific on the detail, we're going to run a couple of minutes longer than normal. You won't see our calls go that long normally, but we wanted to &#x2013; and Nikos, I think you worded it best &#x2013; do the importance of getting the data right and people do not misunderstand what we're doing or what we're doing, we went a little bit longer and I apologize for that. So rather than stop at this time, Blair, I'd like to take a couple more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great. So let's go ahead and take another question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next questions will be from Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. John, I wanted to ask you about your approach to acquisitions in this environment. You said I think in the past, or at least I think I've heard you've said that you wished you were more aggressive during the last downturn. And given the transition that's going on in data centers especially and in light of potential for some repatriation legislation as part of the stimulus package, I was wondering, would your approach to acquisitions be different this time around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, breaking the question into a couple pieces; first is the exciting part about today's market is just about everybody's for sale. And the second most exciting part is the prices are pretty reasonable, Ned, even by your standard of toughness. And our ideal target has not changed: 100 engineers, a product that if you just come to market that's hot or about to come to market, and I think you will see us active in all segments of the market. In fact, if I were betting, it would not surprise me to see us move on the consumer side before you see us even move on some of the other areas.</p>
          <p>In terms of your indirect question, John, why haven't you moved? Well, the answer's real simple. The markets continue to go down. So by not moving up to this point in time, it's probably been a good decision on our part. Nobody can judge the bottom, and obviously we're not going to attempt to. But our watching the market at this time has served us very, very well in terms of direction. But my ideal target has not changed.</p>
          <p>Having said that, if we come out of this economic slowdown without being very aggressive on both on our internal development, which we clearly have painted a picture today we're going to do, our new ideas and new approaches, and acquisitions starting with the consumer because I have signed off on Ned's business plan to move to 3 to 5 billion for his area of responsibility with a chance to get to 10 &#x2013; and Ned, I'm going to hold you accountable for that &#x2013; but you will see us active across the board in each category. But I'd say up to now, our hesitation in terms of timing has worked out well, but we don't try to, again, figure out when the bottom will be. We tend more when the market transitions will occur, they clearly are occurring in our opinion over the next six to 12 months. And this is tailor-made for us in terms of the approach.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately the repatriation decision was turned down in the Senate last night. That would have been a great chance to see an additional 600 to $750 billion brought back to the U.S. and put into the market, which is almost the size of the stimulus package. But I understand the decision's on the politics side and we'll move on from that. But that probably should not be part of your analysis, Jason, in terms of cash availability for me or other players.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question will be from Jeff Kvaal of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. John, I was wondering if you could give us a flavor of if there was a particular customer set that was weaker towards the end of the year into this year. And then why would you &#x2013; what gives you the confidence to include the January decline year over year as the bottom end of the revenue guidance range for the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very fair question. I'm not trying to dodge it. I just want to think for a second. I think the one that weakened a little bit faster than we expected would have been service provider, Rick. And we saw that in most geographies around the world, even in Japan where the next generation networks are clearly going to occur. They took the foot off the gas pedal for a period of time, didn't hit the brakes, but sure as heck weren't accelerating. Rob, here in the U.S. our big interface customers such as Verizon and AT&amp;T, where we've got great relationships, they slowed a little bit. And candidly, Comcast, Time Warner, and other cable companies did as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, another thing in terms of providers, particularly in the U.S., Rob, is the extraordinary growth leading up to this downturn that we experienced there, comparisons really exacerbate some of the gross changes in the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They do in the short term. I agree, Rick. But I think also your networks are going to get loaded long term. And if you were to say back to the second part of the question, Jeff, is you can't stop putting in storage or servers. You basically can only run those and when they get filled, you've got to add more. The network you can run hotter and you can balance a little bit and live with a little bit of degradation in the process. And so that was probably the one that surprised me a little bit with the speed at which it slowed down.</p>
          <p>Having said that, our relationship has never been stronger across most all service providers around the world, and the loads are continuing to increase. You will have a temporary perhaps hesitation in terms of the companies lay off people, but the loads will continue to grow in the network. And so that's probably the one that I say has the potential to come back with the most predictability.</p>
          <p>So back to the second part of your question, it's probably the commercial marketplace that I'll watch. That tends to spend &#x2013; when their business goes up, they spend. They tend not to pay as much attention to the "herd" instinct. The bottom line is if business is good, they spend; and if not, they don't. Other aspects, hot products sell. Ned, we've seen that again even in the tough season in the holidays, the real hot products, high definition TVs, et cetera, did sell well, even in tough times. So I hope that helps, Jeff. I know it's not an ideal answer, but it's a snapshot of what we're seeing.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, I think we have time for just one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question will be from Simon Leopold of Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Maybe we can leave on a more positive note then. You talked about being a bit more optimistic, John, in terms of the recovery maybe late in '09. If you could talk about what a recovery actually might look like in terms of what recovers first for you, clearly you've suggested the U.S. What I'm wondering is routers have been down quite a bit. So do they snap back or do we continue to see more favorable trends from some of the advanced technology? So a little bit more color on what the recovery looks like even if you can't talk about the timing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the question that you started with, routers tend to tie very closely to loads on networks and tie very closely to what service providers are seeing. So I think while there is a lot in enterprise and some in the commercial marketplace, your question with about router numbers will turn up as network loads continue to grow. That's inevitable; the only question is how quickly does it snap back, to your point. And the second part is how good a job do we do in partnering with service providers to help them monetize those loads, which is a very important issue for them as they go forward.</p>
          <p>However, to your second part that you're leading me toward, the advanced technologies look pretty good. And Rob, we were talking about that about areas that we think we could be even more aggressive on. And Ned you and I were talk thing morning about video and architecturally playing more across the board. TelePresence, as an example, will become material a year from now in terms of the volume. It's probably the best way for CEOs really to understand what collaboration and Web 2.0 is about.</p>
          <p>Now if you're saying, John, what do you think is going to be the hottest thing we're talking about year from now? It's going to be collaboration and Web 2.0. I mean, you watch those ramp-up numbers, which we saw. That is identical to what happen in '93 &#x2013; '94 when we were doing &#x2013; we were the first company really doing a lot of orders over the Internet and doing the majority of our support over the Internet. These numbers are equally as aggressive except they are by month, not by quarter. And for those of you who have been following those numbers with us, you notice they uptick every month that has occurred over the last 12.</p>
          <p>So my own view of what's going to be most exciting on this upturn is Web 2.0 technologies changing business models and collaboration. People at first tend to hesitate about jumping into that until they see the payback and productivity. And then they begin to ramp, but that's probably an area that I'm personally am the most excited about looking 12 to 24 months out.</p>
          <p>So Simon, I want to thank you for ending on a positive note. Blair, I always tease you about you always saying we'll take one or two more questions and make sure we get one we can end on a positive note with, and Simon saved us and that was very kind. So let me switch it to you.</p>
