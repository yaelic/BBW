          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. The conference is about to begin. Good day, and welcome to the Amazon Quarterly Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2010 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 27, 2011 only and will include forward looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.</p>
          <p>Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion. Return on invested capital was 34% down from 66%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares, compared with 461 million shares.</p>
          <p>Worldwide revenue grew 36%, to $12.95 billion or 37% excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year over year changes in foreign exchanges rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime.</p>
          <p>Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12%, or 13% excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60%, or 62% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 48%. Worldwide unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 130 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 30% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 33% to $2.63 billion, and gross margin was 20.3%</p>
          <p>Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&amp;A combined was $2.01 billion, or 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year over year. Fulfillment was $1.06 billion, or 8.2% of revenue, compared with 7.7%. Tech and content was $456 million, or 3.5% of revenue, compared with 3.1%. Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year.</p>
          <p>Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items.</p>
          <p>In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $7.21 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion. EGM revenue grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin.</p>
          <p>In the International segment, revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion; revenue growth was 29% adjusting for the $143 million year over year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 11% to $2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 billion or 50% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 49% of International revenues, up from 43%. International segment operating income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 16%.</p>
          <p>CSOI grew 4% to $622 million, or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points year over year. Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 7%. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was relatively flat at $474 million, or 3.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4, or a 17% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $384 million and $0.85 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 40% to 34.2 billion. North America revenue grew 45% to 18.71 billion and International grew 33% to 15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year over year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, grew 23% to 1.94 billion, or 25% excluding $28 million of unfavorable year over year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 75 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 25% to 1.41 billion, or 4.1% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities increased 2.4 billion year over year to 8.76 billion. Inventory increased 48% to 3.2 billion, and inventory turns were 11.4, down from 12.2 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 44% to 8.05 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our Q4 2010 capital expenditures were $328 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth including investments in technology; infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services; capacity to support our fulfillment operations; and investments in corporate office space.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results inherently are unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we've described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intracompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.</p>
          <p>For Q1 2011, we expect net sales of between $9.1 and $9.9 billion, a growth of between 28% to 39%. This guidance anticipates approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between 260 and 385 million, or between 34% decline and 2% decline. This includes approximately 140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $400 and $525 million, or between 21% decline and 4% growth.</p>
          <p>We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on with the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great; thanks. Can you hear me? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can hear you, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. Two questions. First, on the gross margin trends, down a little bit year over year. Would that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth quarter? And secondly, could you just talk broadly about the Subscribe &amp; Save offering that you have and what &#x2013; to what extent you've seen cross-selling into more kind of consumer stable items amongst your customer base? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of gross margins, you are seeing some volatility. If you look at the individual quarters from 2010, you saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up the next two quarters slightly, and then down a little bit in Q4, about approximately 45 basis points.</p>
          <p>And we haven't been talking much about gross margins because we don't think it's that meaningful, and that's why we're trying to point people to the bottom again. And the reason we're doing that is because of the mix of business. And so what you're seeing there in gross margins in Q4 is we have a very broad mix of businesses and geographies that are going into that number, and again you're seeing some volatility in the individual quarters.</p>
          <p>But again, we're very pleased with what we saw in Q4 in terms of growth and overall performance of the business, and it reflects a very heavy investment load to support the growth that we expect.</p>
          <p>In terms of Subscriber &amp; Save, could you repeat the question again? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What kind of impact have you seen, and what kind of adoption rate have you seen for that? And just broadly your penetration of kind of consumer staple spending amongst the Amazon customer base? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Subscribe &amp; Save is going very well. It's something that certainly customers like a lot. And we're getting that benefit in the consumer portion of the consumer category today, and again it's something that we're excited about and customers are excited about. So we're happy to offer it to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you for taking my questions. If I could ask just two questions about revenue growth, and I don't want to sound critical of revenue growth because the absolute growth rates are very high, so just speaking into two components. First of all, is there any big obvious reason why International growth decelerated while domestic growth accelerated? And then secondly, in the media business, if e-book sales are now bigger than paperback sales, and paperback sales continues to grow, is there a big obvious reason why total media sales are growing at 13% rather than a slightly faster number? I assume that the agency accounting for e-books is part of that, perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in terms of &#x2013; you're absolutely right -- in terms of overall growth, we are very pleased with what we saw. Just kind of frame up that discussion a bit, we saw 40% growth year over year, total year 2010, which is the best growth rate we've seen since 2000. We saw Q4 growth rates overall of 37% on a local currency basis, which matches our best growth rate for any Q4 we've had on a local currency basis since 2000.</p>
          <p>And then unit growth was 43%, which certainly going back several years we haven't seen a quarter, any quarter that's had that growth. So we're seeing very strong growth across many categories across many geographies.</p>
          <p>In terms of the International growth specifically, if you look back to last year, we did have very strong media growth in International in Q4. You'll see that it's up 26% on a local currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we've had, and we're overlapping at that. There were some new releases that were in Q4 last year, most notably the Windows 7 release, one; Dan Brown's book in Germany is another. Those are a few examples, but there were few releases that were in there.</p>
          <p>The other piece, too, that we haven't &#x2013; certainly difficult to quantify, but there was certainly some impact from some of the weather that we saw in Europe during the month of December. But again, we're very pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including International, and we're happy with what we see there.</p>
          <p>In terms of some of your questions surrounding media, again, we're seeing good growth there. As you mentioned, we're seeing so far quarter to date, this quarter, we saw that Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, and &#x2013; which is very exciting -- and while having paperbacks continue to grow year over year, so again we're seeing very strong growth there. So again, very pleased with the growth we're seeing across the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a drag on the media growth from the accounting for the agency e-books?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say that again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the fact that some of the e-books are being sold on an agency rather than a consignment basis this year acting as a drag on growth temporarily in terms of your reported revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly the agency piece is included in the numbers that we reported today, but in terms of the impact, we're not breaking that out. But again, we're very excited with the growth that we're seeing within books, e-books specifically, and physical books are going well as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. I guess two quick ones. First, Tom, for the first quarter guidance, it would seem like your operating income guidance implies that you're still reinvesting in the business. Could you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers, is it tech and content, all of the above? And secondly, with the LoveFilms (sic) [LoveFilm] acquisition, can you just walk us through the rationale and how you'll integrate that with perhaps your other video-on-demand businesses? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context, and that probably the best way to do it is just again a reminder on 2010, the fact that we had very strong growth, the best growth we've seen in 10 years. Fourth quarter matched the best on a local currency basis growth, matched the best fourth quarter we've had since 2000. And again, very strong unit growth; best we've seen.</p>
          <p>With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most of which was in the second half of last year. We added fulfillment capacity to support our retail business; we added fulfillment capacity to support our growing Fulfilled by Amazon business as part of our seller business; we added a lot of infrastructure capacity to support our fast growing AWS business as well as our retail business.</p>
          <p>And so when you &#x2013; those reflected &#x2013; when you look at our Q4 results and our 2010 results, those are reflected in the CapEx numbers that you're seeing, and those are reflected in the fulfillment as well as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line items. And so because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you're seeing more of that in Q1. So those are reflected in the growth rate.</p>
          <p>Now, the question will be we're not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this mean going forward? And so is one of the things that we're doing is certainly when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about Q1 with very strong growth. And we'll have to see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that.</p>
          <p>But again, I'm very, very happy with the capital we were able to deploy. You should keep in mind that with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010, it doesn't become &#x2013; it's not fully utilized day one, and it's not &#x2013; we don't get the optimum productivity on day one. So what that means is we get productivity on those operations, we get returns on those assets that we deploy over a period of time. If you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that capital, and so to me I'm very pleased to put that capital in place. And if we have to add more in 2011, it will be a high quality problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on LoveFilms (sic) [LoveFilm] ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>LoveFilm, we think it's just a very exciting opportunity. We've had a close association with that business for some time. We're very pleased to be able to offer customers in the video space within Europe their offering. So again we're very excited about it, and you'll have to stay tuned on that one.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking the question. Two things: First, I just wanted to ask in terms of the revenue growth that you're expecting for 1Q, can you give us a sense of how much you're anticipating from acquisitions? And then secondly, if you could comment just on your thinking around the LivingSocial investment, and also what you may have learned from recent daily offer, which you ran within the last week or so? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the guidance for Q1, specifically in terms of acquisitions, LoveFilm or Quidsi, which haven't closed yet, are not reflected in guidance. So those are not in our Q1 numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of LivingSocial, we're very pleased with the investment that we've made there. In terms of any commentary on the recent deal, the recent one-day offer that they had, we're very excited that they offered Amazon gift certificates, and we think it's great for customers, and we're happy to enable that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We will take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Two questions. First, an update on AWS. It looks like other revenue in North America slowed pretty significantly, and I realize that's a decent part of other. Any commentary on what was the main driver of that slower growth? And second, on grocery, can you give us a little more insight on your initiatives there and the potential cost impact from expanding this category? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of AWS, we're extremely pleased with how AWS is going. It's growing at a very fast rate. We're investing in that business to support that growth rate. You're correct in terms of seeing the North America other growth rate drop from 52% to 45% year over year from Q3 to Q4. Keep in mind that there's a number of things in there, including AWS, that tend to be a little lumpy. And &#x2013; but we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from Q3 to Q4. So built into that number, it actually accelerated. So again, we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there.</p>
          <p>In terms of grocery, we have two things that you probably &#x2013; you could be referring to. One is our dry goods business, which is within our Consumer business that we're very pleased with, that we have on Amazon.com as well as some other sites. In addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called AmazonFresh. Again, that is a test that we've been conducting. We're pleased with how the test is going, but again it's a test and we'll continue to see how that goes and see if we invest further on that test.</p>
          <p>Again, we do a number of tests in different parts of our business, and that happens to be one of them. And we have a great team that's working on it, but you'll have to stay tuned to see if we do more there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two quick questions. One, Tom, can you tell us how many distribution centers you actually had at the end of 2010? I know you're not going to guide to 2011 since you were guiding to Q1. Are you planning on opening any distribution centers, and what's your CapEx for Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of &#x2013; we had approximately, approximately 52 at the end of 2010. We added 13 last year. We will add more fulfillment centers this year. We haven't said &#x2013; aren't saying how many yet because again we're trying to determine what the growth rate will be, and based on what we've seen Q1, we're &#x2013; we're certainly cautiously optimistic, which is reflected in the growth rate you see for guidance for Q1. So we'll have to wait and see, and we'll be back with you as we go throughout the year.</p>
          <p>But just to be clear, again, I mentioned in one of the other questions, I think it would a very high quality problem. And the reason why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world right now, which is the same thing we've been doing for last 15 or 16 years, and working with our various fulfillment centers, is &#x2013; even though we're not fully utilized in some of these new assets that we deployed in 2010, or our productivity is not optimum, that team is working &#x2013; we'll work to utilize those assets as we continue to grow. We'll get better productivity as we go, just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we've had experience with.</p>
          <p>So we're very excited about that. And so when we &#x2013; when you think about these new fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit dilutive in the short-term by looking at our fulfillment expense &#x2013; the reason why I'm very excited about it is you can just look at our return on invested capital. If you take our return &#x2013; our invested capital at the end of 2010, we had approximately 7.4 billion of invested capital; that's a five-point average over the last five quarters. If you take out cash and marketable securities over the same period, it's about 6.5 billion. So we have about 900 million of invested capital, and even with our heavier spend in CapEx last year, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow. So we have in excess of 250% return on our invested capital, ex cash and marketable securities.</p>
          <p>And so &#x2013; again, that's the full business, includes a lot of things over a period of time. But if you think about that capacity, where we need it, because of growth, we're certainly very happy. We do it judiciously and make sure we do it appropriately, but very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns for shareholders over time. And again, the returns that we've gotten are certainly historical, not predictive. But again we're very happy to deploy that capital, and I feel very good about it.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you quantifying CapEx for Q1, or no?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't quantified the CapEx for Q1. I apologize. But again, we will do what we need to do to support the growth in both infrastructure and fulfillment.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, one follow-up on the gross margins. I think historically Amazon's pricing philosophy has been to be a price follower, and I guess I'm curious if perhaps you're loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader in more categories. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of pricing, we've had a number of different strategies over the course of our history, but certainly our objective is to have great values for customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies, and that hasn't changed.</p>
          <p>And so we're very excited to offer customers that. It's the reason &#x2013; certainly one of the drivers for the growth that we've been able to have over our history, and so one of the things that we do do is when we enter a new category, and add selection within that category, we price it day one as competitively as we can. So in other words we price it competitively day one, based on the intelligence we have. And sometimes that means that it's very low gross margin because we're just entering those particular categories with those particular items. And so that's something we've been consistently doing for a number of years, and we like that strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot of interest in how the Kindle ecosystem actually impacts to the margin. I was wondering if you could just help us understand &#x2013; well, one question would be all-in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing together, how is that impacting gross margin? And then overall how should we think about how the agency model and the e-books, how that's going to impact margin? And then just one quick one. There's been some speculation about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime. Just wondering if you could tell us how you think about that and is that something that may be interesting in the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First of all, we have a longstanding practice of not breaking out any individual products or categories, but what I can say about Kindle is it's growing very fast. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing. We sold millions of devices in Q4. The content business, the content part of it's growing very fast. As evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings release so far quarter to date this quarter, again, Q1, we have Kindle content, Kindle book sales growing at a faster rate than paperbacks, and &#x2013; which is really exciting.</p>
          <p>And so that business is going very well, and with the opportunity that we see there, we're continuing continue to invest in that business. We think it's a very good business for us, and we're excited about the long-term opportunity there.</p>

          <p>Thank you. One quick follow up: Maybe you could explain why Kindle is a better business for Amazon. And then secondly, you talked about gross margin maybe not being the best way to measure the company. Maybe you could explain why operating margin is better. And do you have individual management targets as far as compensation or as a company as a whole on where you want to get to for operating margins? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understood the first part of your question related to Kindle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm asking why Kindle is a better business than your traditional book selling media business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we happen to like both. Even though we're extremely excited about our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well. And so we're very excited about both parts of our business, and again we think &#x2013; when I was mentioning Kindle, we just think it's a great opportunity for us. It has great tracks right now; customers like it. We're able to offer so many titles right now on less than 60 seconds right to &#x2013; for a customer to be able to read.</p>
          <p>And one of the things you can't do with a physical book is you can't from a service perspective, with our model, it's very difficult to get it to a customer now. And with Kindle we can do that in less than 60 seconds. You can carry around your library with you, very likely. And so we think it's just great for customers, and we're seeing that the growth both in terms of devices and content is just fantastic, and so we're continuing to invest and continuing to improve that experience for customers.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross margins versus operating margins, we actually don't focus a lot on individual percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins. We're focused ultimately over the long-term on free cash flow, free cash flow per share. We like to look at return on invested capital. I mentioned earlier what our return on invested capital is today. That includes, appropriately so, the cash and marketable securities that we have in that balance.</p>
          <p>But certainly if you &#x2013; if we were to deploy that cash and return that to shareholders over time, you can see the underlying returns on invested capital ex-cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now. And so we think it's a very efficient capital business, and we think that we certainly like the model that we have and the opportunity it brings to the shareholders over the long-term.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. A couple questions. First of all, I guess when you look at the Kindle side of the equation, do you believe that the proliferation of Kindle apps across devices, not just your own device, is helping to increase the overall consumption of books across the industry or Amazon? And then second, I guess as it relates to International, where do you stand in terms of pan-European fulfillment capabilities, say shipping from Germany into the Netherlands, into Scandinavia, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Kindle apps, we think it's good for customers that they can read their book &#x2013; their Kindle books on their Kindle as well as many other devices. And so that's what you see today. We have these apps so that it's easy for customers to be able to do that. Customers like that feature, and you should expect us to continue to expand that over time. So how much it's contributing to overall growth is hard to say. But again, customers responding to the vast selection that we have, the good prices, the great prices we have for Kindle content, the ease of which they can carry it around with them with a great convenience on the device, the Kindle device itself, so we're very excited about it.</p>
          <p>In terms of fulfillment, we continue to work with our fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers. That's really what it's all about in each of the geographies we're in, and we'll continue to do so. So wherever we can make that service within Europe better for customers, we will. It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may ask a follow up &#x2013; you've had tremendous growth in customers over the past year, about 24 million or so. Do you think that your lifetime kind of value of the customer equation has changed, particularly as you looked at &#x2013; you have initiatives like Kindle and Prime? Do you think that the economics have changed obviously for the better that you're acquiring more aggressively? Is that how we should think about some of these newer initiatives that you've had over the last several years that have been certainly been pretty impactful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, not commenting on the lifetime value of customers, but we continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for customers. So we're adding new selection to make that better for customers. We're adding &#x2013; we launched Prime a number of years ago, which continues to grow because we wanted to make sure that we give great service to customers. We &#x2013; many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure we get customers not only great &#x2013; great price and great selection, but they get to have their content immediately.</p>
          <p>And so those are things that &#x2013; with us, we start with customer first. That's where our focus is. We've found that by aligning with the customer, it's been great for customers as well as great for shareholders over time. And so that's the focus that we've had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, question on marketing. If we look at marketing as a percentage of revenues this year, it was up, and I believe you said one of the may reasons was the inclusion of Zappos. And as we think about your marketing spend in 2011, is that the sort of seasonality and pattern that we should look for, or is anything changing in your approach to marketing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we did &#x2013; yeah, certainly we added &#x2013; continued to support the Zappos marketing spend in 2010 was a part of it. We're always looking for ways to reach customers through our marketing spend. We also did &#x2013; you probably noticed, a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting for the most part heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw great response to. So again, those are some of the dynamics to think about.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Had a question on Prime membership. Now that it's been active in the U.S. for quite a long time now, are you still seeing new members adopting Prime at a rapid rate? And I'm wondering when you think that may plateau as far as penetration in terms of the existing customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. We are seeing adoption of Prime in our geographies continue to grow nicely. And we &#x2013; customers like Prime; they like the service element of Prime. We have different offerings depending on the geography that we're offering it in. In the U.S. you can get express two-day shipping for free. You get one day and also some other offers in terms of weekend offers as well. So again, there's some interesting service elements to that and customers are responding very well to it, both existing customers as well as &#x2013; sorry; existing Prime members as well as new Prime members. So it's going very well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great; thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a sense -- is there a way to quantify the amount of time necessary for the recently opened distribution facilities to get to the same utilization level that you're seeing in the rest of the business? And what kind of impact do you think that has on operating margins to the extent that you can kind of quantify that for us?</p>
          <p>And in light of the investments in this quarter, I guess it's worth at least asking if you still feel like 10% is the right long-term operating margin to be thinking about for the whole business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of when these fulfillment centers will reach their optimum utilization and productivity, we're still getting productivity on existing fulfillment centers that we've had for quite some time. So it will be something that will evolve over a longer period of time, but again if you look at the returns that we've gotten on these &#x2013; the previous fulfillment centers that we've launched, they've been great uses of capital. So we're very happy about that.</p>
          <p>And in terms of your question on double-digit operating margins, we've said for a long time, and nothing has changed in that regard, we think that certainly double-digit operating margins are possible. If it means that we have some high single digit operating margin that maximizes free cash flow, we're certainly okay with that and have room to go there. But we're certainly focused on how do we get the best free cash flow, free cash flow per share, while getting great efficiency on our invested capital. And so nothing has changed there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, in our assessment there are many international markets which have grown healthier than the growth you achieved in Q4, and I know it is a blended growth number and probably some FX dynamics, but are you seeing any local, basically local e-commerce players getting stronger in international market? And secondly, any signs of traction for the launch of the site in Italy? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we grew 29% on the local currency basis for International, 26% on a dollar basis, challenging compare from fourth quarter of 2009 where we certainly from a media perspective had one of our best growth rates that we've had in any quarter previously. EGM grew at 50% on a local currency basis, so very strong growth.</p>
          <p>And again, we have a longstanding practice of not talking about other companies, but we're very pleased with what our International team is doing. We have a great opportunity there for further growth. In terms of Italy, very early, but pleased with what we're seeing so far and like the opportunity there.</p>
