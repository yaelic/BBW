          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Casey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Ratcliffe, President and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Casey. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be with you for our fourth quarter earnings call, and joining me today is Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today, in addition to providing historical information. There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and our subsequent filings.</p>
          <p>Also, now available on our Investor Relations website is a supplemental deck of slides highlighting recent operational and financial performance. The slides also provide details on information that will be discussed in today's call, such as our current three-year forecast for capital expenditures. In addition, these slides provide reconciliations for certain non-GAAP financial information that will be discussed on this call.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the information we released this morning, we had a good quarter and a solid year of business results. The fact that our business is performing well in a difficult and uncertain period speaks to the strength of our business model and our goal to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long run. In the long-term, I remain optimistic about the economic future of the Southeast and the ability of Southern Company to execute our business strategy. Let me share just a few reasons why.</p>
          <p>In our four-state area, Southern Company continues to provide customers with the best reliability and customer satisfaction in the industry, and in no small part because we're still able to deliver those results at prices well below the national average. This in turn provides an environment which promotes capital formation.</p>
          <p>In 2008, there were a number of positive developments in our wholesale business from a regulatory and growth perspective. At the federal level, we filed a proposal with the federal energy regulatory commission that addresses generation dominance perceptions in the southern control area. FERC accepted our proposal for an energy auction, subject to certain conditions that we have agreed to meet. This auction, once implemented, mitigates any perceived horizontal market power that Southern companies may have in the Southern control area, and it preserves our ability to charge market-based rates in this region going forward.</p>
          <p>In our competitive generation business, we have made significant strides to continue the expansion of Southern Power. As you may already know, Southern Power announced in December that it will build on and operate four combustion turbine units in Cleveland County, North Carolina. The units will be able to generate approximately 720 megawatts. The majority of the capital -- I'm sorry &#x2013; the majority of the capacity will be used to supply peaking needs through long-term contracts with two wholesale customers, the North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation and the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number One.</p>
          <p>Also at Southern Power during 2008, we extended contracts with current customers. Contracts representing 1200 megawatts were lengthened an average of 17 years, demonstrating the strength of our customer focused model.</p>
          <p>As a result of the current liquidity issues in the market, we're seeing opportunities to obtain assets, including renewable generation, around the region and across the nation. We believe that Southern Company is uniquely positioned to perform well in both strong and challenged markets. For example, even in a period of credit turmoil, we've been able to access the capital markets. As a result, with our A credit rating, we issued approximately $3.6 billion of long-term debt at an average rate of less than 4.5% during 2008. Even as the financial crisis worsened in the fourth quarter, when many investment grade utilities were unable to issue debt, we placed $1 billion of long-term debt.</p>
          <p>Our debt now has an average maturity of 13.5 years and an average cost of 4.75%. Among the lowest maturity and &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; the longest maturity and the lowest cost debt portfolios in the industry.</p>
          <p>We are mindful that the current recession is impacting virtually every economy this year. Looking beyond 2009, we remain optimistic about the Southeast and the opportunities for our growth here in the region.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial performance for 2008, and provide earnings guidance for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David, and good afternoon to everyone. As David said, we had a good quarter and a solid year. First, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2008 results. Then I'll discuss our economic outlook, capital budget, and guidance for the full year 2009, and for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>However, before I review our earnings for 2008, I want to update you on the resolution of an important tax matter. After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service regarding certain leases, Southern Company accepted a settlement offer from the IRS on January 8. An additional after-tax charge of 16 million, or $0.02 per share, was recorded in the fourth quarter to fully recognize settlement of the SILO litigations.</p>
          <p>Now for the numbers for the quarter and for the full year compared with 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported $0.24 a share. That's a decrease of $0.03 per share from the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding our synthetic fuel investments and SILO adjustments, we earned $0.26 a share in the fourth quarter of 2008, which was the same result we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, we reported $2.26 per share, a decrease of $0.03 per share over the prior year. Excluding our synthetic fuel investments and SILO adjustments, our earnings for the full year were $2.37 per share, an increase of $0.16 per share over our results for 2007.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our numbers for the full year compared to 2007, excluding synthetic fuel investments and SILO adjustments. First, I'll cover the negative factors. Here's the breakdown. Higher depreciation and amortization, and higher interest expense, reduced our earnings by $0.18 per share in 2008 compared with the prior year. These increases in depreciation and interest expense are due primarily to overall rate-based growth for our traditional operating company, and the corresponding need for additional financing.</p>
          <p>Weather reduced our earnings by $0.09 per share in 2008 compared to 2007. Weather was $0.02 a share below normal in 2008. In 2007, weather was $0.07 a share above normal, so the result was a $0.09 per share negative impact.</p>
          <p>Non-fuel O&amp;M [operations and maintenance expenses] for our traditional companies reduced our earnings by $0.10 a share in 2008 compared with 2007. This is due primarily to the costs associated with new environmental equipment and additions to our generation fleet.</p>
          <p>The impact of higher taxes other than income taxes had a $0.05 per share negative impact on our earnings in 2008 compared with the prior year. While customer growth was a positive $0.04 per share compared with 2007, lower usage among all classes of customers was a negative $0.06 per share, resulting in a reduction in earnings of $0.02 per share in 2008 compared with 2007.</p>
          <p>Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding, due to issuances through our employee savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan, reduced our earnings by $0.04 a share.</p>
          <p>So total negative factors reduced our earnings by $0.48 a share in 2008. Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings.</p>
          <p>Retail revenue growth in our traditional business added a total of $0.56 per share to our earnings in 2008 compared with the prior year. This impact was driven primarily by price changes and revenues related to recovery of environmental expenditures, and market response rates for large commercial and industrial customers.</p>
          <p>Other revenue in our four traditional operating companies contributed $0.02 per share to our earnings. Other income and deductions, primarily attributable to AFUDC equity, added $0.02 per share to our earnings in 2008 compared with 2007. Southern Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in 2008 compared to the prior year. Finally, lower expenses at the parent company, primarily lower interest costs, added $0.03 a share to our earnings in 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>So for the full year, we had $0.64 of positive drivers and $0.48 of negative items. Excluding synthetic fuel investments and SILO adjustments, we exceeded our guidance range of $2.28 to $2.36 per share by $0.01. And our year end came in at $2.37 compared with $2.21 in 2007. This represents a 10% growth in earnings per share over the 2007 guidance midpoint.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our capital budget, our capital expenditures for the three-year period of 2009 through 2011 are expected to be $16.6 billion. We have included 1.9 billion for the start of two additional nuclear units at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. Assuming the project is certified by the Georgia Public Service Commission in March, we would then begin spending capital on limited work activities, with major construction beginning in 2011.</p>
          <p>Also included in our capital budget is 1.1 billion for the proposed IGCC facility in Mississippi, which is &#x2013; which we expect to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013, assuming we receive the required regulatory approvals. Finally, there is 2.2 billion for Southern Power included in our three-year capital budget. As David mentioned earlier, we are seeing opportunities for asset acquisitions and generation expansion, so we believe current market conditions could enable us to further improve both short- and long-term growth profile of Southern Power.</p>
          <p>So the overall capital budget for 2009 through 2011 is projected to be approximately $16.6 billion, reflecting the requirements needed to meet the long-term growth of the region, plus environmental and reliability requirements.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the economy, the Southeast has not been immune to the current economic recession. Customer growth, which has historically been approximately 1.5%, declined to 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Going forward, we expect to see this lower growth continue for most of 2009. However, history has shown that the Southeast enters recessions later, that the downturns are typically not as deep, and the recoveries occur more rapidly in relation to the rest of the United States. While every economic period is unique, we believe that the long-term fundamentals of the Southeast remain strong. We remain optimistic about the ability of the Southeast to continue to attract new residents and new businesses.</p>
          <p>For example, during the past three years, Alabama Power and Georgia Power on a combined basis have evaluated over 350 economic development projects. Currently, there are more than 200 active economic development projects under evaluation across our service territory, a strong evidence that the Southeast remains an attractive location to live and do business.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our financial goals and earnings outlook for 2009. To achieve our objective of providing shareholders a superior risk adjusted return over the long-term, our financial plan is geared to produce top quartile ROE performance, which in turn supports a growing, stable dividend and industry-leading financial integrity. Our goal is to continue to grow the dividend consistent with a target payout ratio of approximately 65 to 70%. Since 2005, we have grown our dividend annually by 4%. Our dividend policy is long-term in nature.</p>
          <p>As those of you who follow Southern regularly will note, since 2004, we have provided an estimated range of earnings per share for our annual guidance. Our actual EPS growth over this time, excluding syn fuel investment and the silo adjustments, have averaged 5.4%.</p>
          <p>As we enter 2009, there is more uncertainty than usual regarding the depth and length of the recession. The current recession's impact on our service territory increased in severity during the fourth quarter of 2008. Therefore, we believe that it is prudent to expand the range of our earnings per share guidance. To capture the range of economic scenarios that have been forecasted, we have grown the bottom of our 2008 guidance range by 1% and increased the top of the 2008 range by 4%. Remember, the EPS guidance for 2008 was $2.28 to $2.36 per share. So for 2009, the resulting range is $2.30 to $2.45 per share, or a $0.15 range.</p>
          <p>Post-recession, we are committed to a long-term growth rate averaging 6%. We believe the fundamentals of our business will continue to support this rate of growth in a post-recessionary economy. So again, with the adjustments for the economic challenges, our guidance range for 2009 is $2.30 to $2.45 per share.</p>
          <p>Finally, to complete our discussions of earnings per share for this year, our estimate for the first quarter of 2009 is a range of $0.39 per share to $0.43 per share.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call back to David for his closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. As Paul indicated, 2009 will bring both challenges and opportunities, and I think we are prepared for both scenarios. We still remain very optimistic about the long-term future of the Southeast and the attractiveness of our region. In the midst of an economic downturn, we must continue to build the foundation for the long-term growth that we expect will resume once the recession has ended.</p>
          <p>As we prepare for future growth in the region, we continue to move forward with plans to add units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. As Paul said, the Georgia Public Service Commission is currently holding hearings on certification of units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle. The hearings will conclude next month, and we expect a decision in mid to late March.</p>
          <p>In addition, a bill has been introduced in the Georgia general assembly to allow the inclusion of construction work in progress for nuclear projects in rate base. Under this proposed legislation, financing costs for the facility would be recovered as the plant is constructed instead of when it is placed into service, avoiding a large, one-time cash -- a one-time increase in rates.</p>
          <p>As Paul mentioned, we're also pursuing the construction of an integrated gasification combined cycle, or IGCC facility in Mississippi. The funds from the Stanton facility in Orlando, which was cancelled in 2007, have been successfully transferred by the Department of Energy to the Kemper County IGCC project in Mississippi. The agreement to allow the transfer of the clean coal power initiative funds, which amounted to $269 million, was completed in December of last year. This represents the remaining portion of the original grant by DOE for the IGCC facility in Orlando. In addition, we are proposing 50% carbon capture on this facility, which will use locally sourced lignite as fuel. Pacific Power filed for certification with the Mississippi Public Service Commission on January 16, and final approval from the Commission could come by the end of the third quarter of 2009. The cost of this 580-megawatt unit is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Coal gasification and nuclear energy, as well as renewables and energy efficiency, are technology options we support for meeting the future limitations on carbon dioxide. As the new administration and Congress begin their work pursuing a national carbon policy -- pursuing a national carbon policy will be high on their agenda. You may have seen that the electric utility industry, through the Edison Electric Institute, has proposed a framework to achieve an 80% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide from current levels by 2050. This proposal would provide significant reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide, while at the same time, helping consumers adjust to large increases in compliance costs. Under this cap and trade proposal, carbon dioxide allowances would initially be allocated to all generators and local distribution companies, at no cost, with the country gradually transitioning to the more expensive full carbon allowance option.</p>
          <p>Under the proposal, short-term targets should be based on available technologies, including energy efficiency, renewable energy, as well as nuclear energy. Medium-term targets should coincide with additional low-carbon technology, such as additional nuclear energy, as well as the capturing and storage of carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. While Southern Company and others companies and others have started research into carbon capture and storage, this technology will not happen overnight. In the interim, it's important for the government to provide a transition period to allow the technology to be developed and deployed, while mitigating the costs to our customers.</p>
          <p>The membership of EEI has joined together to develop what I believe is a workable proposal, one that protects customers, encourages technology development, and most of all, can achieve meaningful reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide. As the chairman of EEI, it's been a pleasure to work with our members to produce this policy recommendation. We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress to achieve a solution to climate change -- to the climate change issues.</p>
          <p>At this point, Paul and I are ready to take your questions. So Casey, we'll take the first question.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggars of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey David, I know you see a lot of a probably better economic data than the rest of us see in the common world. Can you just share some of the maybe some more deeper thoughts on what you guys are expecting for economic recovery in your service territory and how that's layering into the earnings guidance you guys gave for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Dan, and I'll ask Paul to sort of chime in as he sees fit. What we saw, if you look at our year last year, we were, like a lot of folks, we had a great first half of the year and then it began to -- erosion began in third quarter and really took significant decrease in the fourth quarter, particularly in the industrial sector. We had seen the erosion in the residential sector throughout the year. The decrease in the industrial sector is not unusual in the fourth quarter, because a lot of facilities decide to take extended outages during the December timeframe. What we are trying to do now is to gather as much intelligence as we can from our industrial base to see if that is an extended outage, or are people actually going to come back, and what their market realities are. There's no question that we've seen a decrease across our entire industrial base. Some of those folks are coming back, and where they are able to compete in this global marketplace and their products are necessary, and -- they will do well and they will continue to produce. Obviously, the automotive sector, the steel sector, anything associated with housing industry is still somewhat depressed.</p>
          <p>When we look at our econometric forecast, what we have in this plan is an expectation that we begin to get some legs under us in the third quarter and start a recovery in the fourth quarter that continues into '10. I personally believe that's an optimistic forecast, but after we did all of our work, and as you suggest, we look at a lot of different ones, that's the one that we found consensus around, and I certainly hope it's right. Now, Paul, do you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Dan, this is Paul. I think, when you look at the economic scenarios that are out in the marketplace, our econometric scenarios internally, you have to really guide the business in a lot of &#x2013; with a lot of uncertainty, especially around the downside, if what we saw in the fourth quarter persists for the whole year, to what David articulated in terms of a starting easing of the recession in the fourth quarter of '09. So that's what gave rise to the broad range of guidance that we're putting forward, because quite frankly, there's so much uncertainty out there.</p>
          <p>Like David also said -- is around industrial class, the fourth quarter did show significant weaknesses, but what we're trying to do is gain as much intelligence associated with those specific industries in our service territories, to get a better feel for what their growth prospects are for the future. Like David articulated, there is some weaknesses, especially around the textile -- chemicals are much more on the neutral side -- but we still have some weaknesses.</p>
          <p>On the upside, we still see that companies that have announced that expansions are continuing on &#x2013; the TK or ThyssenKrupp steel manufacturing facility, which announced an expansion in Mobile, Alabama, this week said they are going to move forward with their &#x2013; a 200-megawatt facility on carbon and delay their 100-megawatt stainless steel facility. So that's positive -- that 200-megawatts moving forward -- versus delaying all of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, let me give you a little more. We had budgeted about 1.5% customer growth for '08. What we saw was about 0.6%. So down, but still positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When I think about -- with that in mind, when I think about 2009, I guess what I'm reading into this is probably you're expecting flat, probably down volumes a little bit in 2009 system-wide. Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a good assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so -- but nothing extreme, not like a down 2% number, versus somewhere between 0 and minus 2? Is that a fair read on where you guys are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I certainly hope so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess along those lines, with kind of the retreat in commodity prices, are you guys going to find some room on the O&amp;M cost side to help offset the volume deterioration this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to find some room on the O&amp;M side every place we can, whether it's commodity prices or just general O&amp;M reductions. So one of the things that we did in December across the company, we implemented a restricted hiring policy. We said to the extent people leave, we're going to work hard not to replace them. There will be some situations where we have to hire people, and we will do so. We also basically said we are not going to grant base salary increases like we normally would. We're going to postpone that decision. We normally would do that in March. We're going to postpone it. We may not grant any at all, depending on what happens. The other thing we did, to your point, was began to implement what we'd already begun in '08, in looking at our O&amp;M costs across the business and restricting meetings and travel, and things like that. So, we're about that, in earnest, in addition to finding the opportunities around commodity prices decreases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, I'd just emphasize one other thing, too, is that &#x2013; because of the economic uncertainties, we're going to manage the business appropriately to try to address some of that, to give us a little bit of headroom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I should assume kind of flattish O&amp;M in '09 versus '08. Is that a reasonable assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. That's a good assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Well, the AMI is rolling out as we speak, in terms of the smart meters. We have installed approximately 800,000 meters in '08. We're projecting approximately 1 million in '09. The total cost is between 400 and $450 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was intrigued by your comment earlier in the call, talking about assets and interest in potentially acquiring assets, and I think I heard you say not just within your own footprint. Can you just elaborate on what &#x2013; where you might be interested, that would be outside of the historical norm? And how you would finance anything on that front? Maybe revisit the plan for equity this year, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, and then Paul can talk about financing. We said earlier, I think on an earlier call, that we we're expanding our universe. We still would prefer to acquire assets in our &#x2013; in what we call super-Southeast. But we've expanded our horizon, and we're willing to look at, I think, anything domestically that makes sense, and that making sense has a lot of criteria to it. But we're not going to limit ourselves geographically at this point. So we're trying to mine that landscape to see what's out there. And if there's something that we think fits and has a good profile to it, we would certainly consider it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, as we mentioned in the third quarter of last call, last year, we anticipate additional equity requirements beyond the capacity of existing programs to maintain our financial integrity. We expect to establish a continuous equity offering program, which we mentioned during that time. The amount and timing or form of any issuance is really dependent on the market conditions and the level of capital expenditures at any given time. So all those scenarios, if you will, or ideas are contemplated in our financial plan. We have not moved forward yet with any of the plans that we mentioned last year. So it will be forthcoming.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Just following on to Jon's question. Presumptively, the $500 million increase in CapEx that you've shown in your slides relative to the slides you show under EEI, I mean, that's all at Southern energy. So is that a placeholder for opportunistic transactions?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, Greg. That is &#x2013; as we have shown in the past, when we show Southern Power's CapEx budget, there is a portion of maintenance costs and activities around site acquisitions in there. But the remaining part are placeholders for opportunities in the marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year-over-year, we saw a subsiding sales use during the '07 year. So there was an increase in '08. That -- so it's a relative position from quarter-to-quarter, which if you look at the annual usage, Steve, then you see the numbers there declining year-over-year.</p>

Low interest rate, low commodities, inventories in housing are starting to decline. So you have some positive indicators, but you also have others that are predicting a worse outcome.</p>

          <p>On the 16.6 billion three-year construction figures, obviously some of that is subject to pre-approval, effectively, by regulators, especially the spending, I guess, on the nuclear plant. There seems to be some controversy going on these days with the Georgia Public Service Commission.

          <p>I didn't see my quote in this morning's newspaper, but I &#x2013; we are not surprised that the staff would not be as enthusiastic about the proposed CWHIP concept, and that's one of the reasons why we've also initiated a legislative initiative to try to get that passed in the state legislature. But I think we're pretty comfortable that we've presented a very good case for why it makes sense to go ahead and do that. And we'll do the homework with the commissioners, as we have in the past. I mean that's -- we continue to work with the staff to make sure they understand it also. So as I said earlier, I'm optimistic about that outcome.</p>

          <p>Carl, associated with the CapEx surrounding just general growth, that was reevaluated during this budgeting cycle, to reflect that it is a slowing growth rate in our area, and our transmission distribution CapEx has been reduced accordingly. On the environmental CapEx, over the three-year period for 8, 9 and 10, we had budgeted 3.9 billion. Now for 9, 10 and 11, we have roughly 3.1 billion, which shows the decline in CapEx going forward. But also remember, most of the environmental CapEx is captured in regulatory mechanisms, so it's ongoing recovery of those dollars.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it looks like, based on the guidance that you gave for the first quarter of $0.39 to $0.43, is that correct?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, $0.41 is the midpoint, it's kind of down $0.06 off of what you reported in 2008, which implies that the low end of your &#x2013; of guidance for 2009 is basically flat earnings for the remaining nine months of the year versus 2008. And I guess it seems to me that would imply kind of perhaps a second quarter recovery as opposed to a third or fourth quarter recovery. I was wondering if you could comment on kind of what -- the quarterly progression, as we think about it throughout the year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The weather impact for 2008 was a negative $0.09 overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, you have a catch up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you also comment on how we should think about power prices, whether or not that will have any impact on the retail operating companies' ability to maintain their high returns through the sharing mechanisms you have on wholesale margin? And whether you're seeing a lot of coal to gas switching, and how that might impact things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, obviously, any time you're in a rising price environment and you have to go before the regulator to get them to approve the prices, you should expect pushback, and we've done that successfully for the last two or three years. So, I think we're not immune to the potential pressure on returns as we continue to have to seek price increases. That's not unique to us by any stretch of the imagination. It's a conversation that we routinely have with our regulators and we're having, as an industry with <mark type="inaudible" />. So, I think we are fully aware of the vulnerability we had with return levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I was referring to the fact that you get to keep some wholesale margin at the retail operating companies. Above &#x2013; there's a sharing band, correct? If you have excess power --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm just wondering with lower power prices generally, do you see that being an incremental headwind this year to your returns? Or is it not -- given the mechanisms you have in place, it shouldn't be something that you'll -- if we see gas continue to go down to $4 or below that level, how might that impact your ability to maintain returns at your retail operating companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That really doesn't have an impact, Steve. When you look at the trading function, where there's additional excess capacity in the marketplace, the margins, because of those fuel prices that you just highlighted, have come down. So the margins are coming down, so the sharing opportunity is reduced. But I do not see that as an impact on overall ROE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And finally, what tax rate should we use for 2009?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what's your expectations for the passage of a national RPS and I guess can you discuss how that might intertwine with your appetite for renewables that you've been discussing, particularly outside of the Southeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's obvious that with the new Congress, there's a strong desire to move forward on an RPS requirement for the entire nation. No question on the House side, since it already passed over there, it will be pretty easy to get done quickly. I think Senator Bingham on the Senate side, has also expressed a desire to move forward. I think the question is whether it moves by itself or whether it gets caught up in other legislation. But if we &#x2013; we are under the impression that we will likely have a renewable portfolio standard. And so we've been working on this for a couple of years now to look at how we might comply with it, and of course we want as much flexibility in the definition as we possibly can, and we want as much credit for energy efficiency as we can get. We'll work hard to do more on efficiency. We are already doing that. And as you suggest, I mean, we're looking at the potential to construct renewable energy in territory, as well as the potential to buy credits throughout the nation, if that makes sense from a market standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about the acquisition of assets outside of your territory? I mean, does that just depend on how the legislation kind of shapes up before you would consider anything outside of the Southeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I think if the legislation provides for us to satisfy the requirements with credits outside of the territory, then that would make an acquisition more attractive to us. But again, provided the deal makes sense, the fundamentals of the deal have to make sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you'd still be looking at it from the economic basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on the RPS question. Do you &#x2013; are you suggesting that perhaps, if there were opportunities outside the Southeast, that you would perhaps increase your risk profile? Are you still looking to maintain the low risk profile that you have today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, our business model is a low risk business model. The model that we associate with Southern Power was a bilateral offtake agreements. The same would be true for renewables, where we would have offtake agreements associated with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would there be the potential of putting assets outside your service territory into rate base -- that was renewable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. There may be the potential to buy renewable credit to satisfy a state requirement -- or a company requirement. But I don't think we try to put it in a rate base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just on the carbon debate, could you just discuss what your current expectations are for CO2 legislation timing, and potentially how that could play out over the next 12 to 18 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that, too, is a new ball game. There's, as you know, there's been a lot of conversation in the congress from Chairman Waxman about moving legislation on the House side as early as Memorial Day recess. I suspect that he has the votes to do that. I would also believe that the Senate would be the place where that would bog down.</p>
          <p>So I think it is not inconceivable. Therefore, it is conceivable that you could pass something on the House this year and have it considered by the Senate. I suspect in its final form, it's 2010 at the earliest, actual legislation being passed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And also, just to highlight a procedural issue, on Alabama, I think there was a deferment of a rate increase. Could you just kind of work through the logistics of that and how we should think about that as it pertains to our model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, when you look at Alabama Power, they had the opportunity to have a dialogue with their commission, looking at their needs for '09, and a proposal of a corrective rate plan that was provided to the commission, which was acted upon in October of last year, which provided approximately $168 million of additional funding for this year beginning January 1. But in exchange for that, they agreed not to be there in 2009. In other words, they won't file anything until 2010 at the earliest, and the corrective rate plan had to do with increasing some of the fees associated with customer charges, like connects and disconnects, and bad checks, and things like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, so it's simply all of that increase came through in '08. Therefore, there's really no impact in '09, or do I have that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The plan was initiated and approved in '08, and the revenue shows up in January &#x2013; beginning January 1 of '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Couple questions specifically related to your projected security issuance. Can you talk a little bit &#x2013; is that, just to confirm, is that all debt issuance, or does -- that also includes equity issuance? And could you also reconcile that relative to your Edison EEI presentation where I think you showed almost 400 million higher in funding needs for '09, yet you've also raised CapEx now for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="inaudible" />, when you look at the '09 numbers in the chart, that is for debt issuances and maturities for the year. So that is correct. The aspect of Southern Power -- really the increase in CapEx associated with Southern Power for the year is not showing up on that chart as of yet. We do not see a need for a significant amount of new debt issuances as of yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the difference can be made up in Southern Power, if you actually follow through with some of those placeholder-type CapEx that's in the budget?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the other thing, just given that you are looking to expand beyond the super Southeast region and looking at generation assets, it seems, would it be logical to think it would be out of the Southern Power box, and how committed are you to sustaining that high BBB rating? Is that sort of part of the lynchpin of your whole thesis here?</p>

          <p>I'm sorry. A regular &#x2013; a non-clean coal plant, I guess, or a &#x2013; I don't know, what would be without the -- without the bells and whistles, if you know what I mean? In other words --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to build any non-clean coal plants anymore. [laughter]</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I know. The term &#x2013; okay. [laughter]</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's the issue, though, really. I mean, we're laughing about it, but the fact of the matter is, it is increasingly difficult to build what we would term a traditional pulverized coal or fluidized bed kind of plant without considering carbon costs. And --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was just wondering what the carbon cost &#x2013; it's all right -- maybe you don't have it &#x2013; I was just wondering if there was an easy comparison as to what &#x2013; how that compares to one that wouldn't have the &#x2013; does that include carbon sequestration?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at cost per KW on a &#x2013; just a pulverized coal unit, and at zero cost of carbon, just make that as a scenario, to kind of put these on equal basis.</p>

          <p>Pulverized coal will run you anywhere between 2000 and $2500 per KW, and an IGCC, with our technology, will run around that $2600 to $3000.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make sure -- we're planning at this facility for a 50% carbon capture. We are not planning on sequestration, meaning we're not going to pump it anywhere and sequester it underground. We will use the CO2 here in enhanced oil recovery.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got you. That's very helpful. And then finally, the SILOs -- are we finished with that issue now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have concluded that.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then -- I'm sorry. One other final thing, the nuke, the pre-funding, if the Georgia Public Service Commission doesn't go for that, and assuming that you go to the legislature and get that bill passed, what would the process then be in terms of how &#x2013; given how the legislation is currently shaping up, what would the process then be in terms of getting &#x2013; how long would it take the PSC &#x2013; would the PSC's approval on that part does not &#x2013; not be an issue, or how would it work after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a non-issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, you just start getting &#x2013; you get pre-funding almost whenever the bill would be enacted in that case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you wouldn't have to go back to the commission? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the commission would have to implement it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I don't think that would be a problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I really appreciate it.</p>

          <p>Sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you mentioned that for '08 customer growth, you had projected 1.5 and it came in at 0.6. Kind of -- what's your baseline for '09 customer growth &#x2013; is it still at the lower 0.06 rate or is it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, <mark type="inaudible" />. We project out that the lower growth rate persists through 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That equated to roughly 25,000 new customer additions for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the industrial sales being down 10% in 4Q and kind of what you're seeing -- have you seen any &#x2013; plant -- permanent plant closings or big layoffs or any of those items in your service territory, or is it just kind of a regular slowdown of activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" />, we've had significant slowdown during that fourth quarter, and like David highlighted, some of these companies took an extended outage during that period, so you had those kilowatt hours being reduced. What we've seen is a shift on the automobile manufacturing segment, where they are moving to one shift operations to try to minimize or reduce their inventory. So we've seen those type of activities. Chemical plants from our interviews so far, are showing that they are coming back. We're having some softness in the steel area because of the global recession. Some of the expansions that were announced are not moving forward, especially around U.S. steel. The other piece I would highlight is around the textile industry, which has been soft for several years, but with the housing slump, they are now seeing a significant reduction in overall sales there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, was the weather &#x2013; the weather impact was negative in '08 versus '07. But how was it versus normal? Was it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for '08, it was $0.02 down versus normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I was wondering, on your refueling recycles for '09, how will that compare to '08 at the midpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are basically normal in terms of our standard pricings around our Southern nuclear plants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that normalized in the way you recover it, or do you expense it kind of as it is incurred?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's normalized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on your major projects that you showed on your slide there, you mentioned the Vogtle and IGCC. What's the timetable for the McDonough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The McDonough plant is a plant that is replacing purchased power contract, as well as a retirement of an existing coal plant. Those come into service in 2011, 2012. So you have two units in 2011 and one unit in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a follow-up question from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The market response contribution embedded into '09 guidance, which I believe you said was $0.10, could you just describe what the significant factors are that could cause actual results to deviate from guidance? Is it sensitive to gas prices, power prices, load growth assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, that's exactly what it is. It's associated with the commodity prices, and as you recall hearing on this call, and I think you already know this, that this price is an incremental pricing product that matches the commodity prices in the market. The other important element that we've had in the past is low hydro generation in our system due to the drought conditions that we experienced in '06 and '07, which automatically drove up the commodity prices in our dispatch, so that has an impact on that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess you're looking at kind of current prices today to &#x2013; the contribution you have today kind of &#x2013; it takes into account your expectation of load growth, which is, you know, that 0 to 2%, as well as kind of the strip as you look at it today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the forecast of fuel prices going forward is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And at this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Ratcliffe, are there any closing remarks?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>No, thanks. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We look forward to recalibrating after the first quarter. Thank you.</p>
