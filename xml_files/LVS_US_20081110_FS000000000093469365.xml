          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference to Mr. Bill Weidner, President and COO, of Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tina, and good afternoon or good evening wherever it might be. I apologize for our delay this afternoon's conference call, but there are several things coming together here at the last moment and I wanted to make sure that we had filed the Q and the press release is actually on its way, it will be there momentarily, I have confirmation that it's in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>But before I begin with what will be something of a longer conference call today because there's a lot of material to cover, I want to make sure that we're talking as it relates to forward looking statements. Statements in this presentation that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
          <p>They include, for example, statements about our business outlook, assessment of market conditions, strategies, future plans, future sales, price assumptions or offerings at our facilities, leverage and debt service, capital spending and tax rates. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They are based on management's expectations that involve a number of business risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. The risks and uncertainties relating to the forward looking statements in this presentation include those described under the caption Risk Factors in Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s public filings in the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today's date. Las Vegas Sands Corporation assumes no obligations to update this information.</p>
          <p>Well, today will be a kind of an interesting conference call. It'll be slightly different from our others and probably a bit more detailed, and we'll be looking at some forecasts here as part of our process. Our process is we announced to the marketplace we engaged Goldman Sachs in a capital raising transaction. We launched a transaction that looked to raise approximately $2 billion of new money.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say that we have commitments to raise about 2.14 billion of new money including the over-allotment and that the transaction was oversubscribed. We are now in the midst of final pricing and expect to file a prospectus supplement either today or tomorrow.</p>
          <p>The Adelson family will be participating in this capital raise. The details will be in those prospectus and the supplement and any future press releases that will happen over the ensuing days. We expect to close this transaction by the end of the week.</p>
          <p>Our press release details a lot of information about the quarter overall. Some information will be contained in our presentation as we make it today, but what I want to try to do is try to give you a understanding of the changes to our plans, the capital raise and how it relates to those changes to our plans, and try to give you a full perspective of what we have been talking to investors about over the last &#x2013; approximately four days.</p>
          <p>We have revised the Company's business plan in order to, as we call it, right-size our global development project pipeline. We are prioritizing our capital expenditures and I'll go over four projects and their stats. First, the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, our intention is to complete the full project according to the original plan. It is a very important project for us. It's a terrific return on marginal invested capital. It's probably the most important project for the Company and this plan fully funds the development of the Marina Bay Sands.</p>
          <p>Second project I want to talk about is Sands Bethworks in Pennsylvania where we will modify our construction process here in order to complete the parking garage, the casino and the support facilities for that casino. Other parts of the project will follow on as market conditions and as cash flow allow.</p>
          <p>We are also suspending temporarily our site five and six project in Macao and we are pursuing a project financing with a major Chinese bank. We would intend to restart that process or that project as we secure the financing on a project basis there in Macao on sites five and six.</p>
          <p>We have slowed or indefinitely suspended our St. Regis condo tower here in Las Vegas. We are completing the podium of that building. The podium contains another mega club that's similar to TAO and Lavo that will be developed as part of the first portion of the project.</p>
          <p>Once again, the tower will be indefinitely suspended. If market condition changed and there is a condominium market and things like that, we could revisit it. But for now, we are indefinitely suspending that.</p>
          <p>We will, as I mentioned, continue to pursue private level financing for five, six in Asia and we would hope to close the transaction with a major Chinese bank in the next three to six months. The Company will pursue opportunities in terms of non-core asset monetization and de-leveraging. Based on this plan we will have built and operated as we're operating now in Macao approximately 1.2 million to 1.3 million square feet of mall space that is currently generating cash out of its rent rolls and this project will finance the building of approximately 700,000 square feet of mall space in Singapore that will be completed somewhere late '09 or early '10.</p>
          <p>So the plan itself to go over those four projects, Marina Bay Sands, Sands Bethworks, sites five and six in Macao and the St. Regis tower, will reduce capital expenditures on development plans for our almost $1.8 billion over the cycle here.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the third quarter's &#x2013; our earnings update and I'm going to turn it over, first of all, to Rob Goldstein to talk about our Las Vegas results and then Brad will then follow-up with our results in Macao.</p>
          <p>Rob?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Las Vegas Venetian and Palazzo combined in third quarter was roughly $73 million. The big miss in Las Vegas related to hold percentage on table games drop. Cumulative hold was about 13% on $480 million in drop at about seven or eight points. I think our expected range was across about 35 or $40 million of revenue. Our slot handle and was $976 million, 6% or roughly 58.3 in slot handle and our occupancy of both hotels was 93% at 218 ADR REVPAR of 202.</p>
          <p>The challenge in Las Vegas continues to be not filling the rooms, but getting the right rate for the rooms. We are continuing to fight rate decline here in Las Vegas across the entire marketplace due to the economy and due to a decline in some of the more important segments. Our &#x2013; those of you who follow the Company know we've had great success in the past with the convention group segment. It has been beaten up a bit by the difficult economy. We've been successful in keeping our occupancy strong. We feel we can stay in the mid-90s; the question is we've got to drive the rate to the levels you want to get to.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter it's a combination of pressures on the FIT wholesale segment as well as pressure on the group segment and lack of group segment and cancellation. On a go forward basis, Palazzo is ramping up and doing very well. It appears to be growing in the marketplace considerably. It is experiencing strong table game demand and growing a slot win as well. And we believe these two products combined are very potent for us in the marketplace and the &#x2013; grow as time goes on here in Las Vegas. We offer 7,000-plus hotel rooms and 10,000 restaurant seats and in January we have a spa, major night clubs and restaurants and retail, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So we think we are a very competitive product even in these difficult times. But again, the pressures in Las Vega related not to filling the hotel but rather to issues relating to ADR. As we look forward to October, October we achieved once again $36 million of EBITDA, cumulative to both properties. Rate was 224 at 96% versus 297 last year in the same time, so obviously a drop in ADR. We won $38 million at tables, held 25%; our slots did over $18 million; and our banquets held up well. So October's spike was a difficult economic environment, obviously in this country and others. We think our October numbers were reasonable in light of what happened in the world economy.</p>
          <p>November, again, is trading up pretty well. We're in mid-90s thus far. We feel our business is staying firm. The biggest challenge in Las Vegas for all, if you heard the calls in the last couple of weeks, for all competitors and all operators in Las Vegas will continue to be rate. We think we'll do fine in occupancy. We think our table and slot win hold up, they'll do well and I think we can continue to grow those numbers. But the issue for this hotel will be keeping our rates in the &#x2013; as high as we can get them and that is the pressure on our numbers thus far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. Brad, do you want to pick up and talk about Macao?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let's talk about Macao and obviously there's a lot questions in Macao and the effect of the visa restrictions that were put on the individual visitation scheme. And really we have two different stories in Macao between the Sands property and the Venetian.</p>
          <p>We turn first to the Sands. We did $43 million of EBITDAR in the third quarter. We were affected by about a little over 0.5% miss in our Rolling Chip program hold percentage. We calculate that cost us about $13 million. So more normalized EBITDAR for that property would have been $56 million.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing at the Sands is continued challenge as competition comes on board there. The visa restrictions hurt the Sands property more than the Venetian property and I think that's evidenced by what's happening with our volumes. Our rolling volume is actually healthy. It increased from about 6.3 million last year, billion, I am sorry to 7.3 billion in this year. So the volume was actually up nicely in that business. However, our non-rolling business, the more &#x2013; the higher margin business went from 812 million down to 652 million. So about a 25% drop in terms of that business. So we do see our challenges in terms of the revenues of staying up there, just the mix of revenues are not favorable to our EBITDAR line.</p>
          <p>On the commission side, the rolling program &#x2013; the commissions remained flat on a year-to-year basis. At the Sands, our challenge is always to take that property and continue to reposition it utilizing the assets we've put in place in the latter part of last year, particularly the hotel, the club and other amenities. At the same time as we've talked about on other previous conference calls, we are in the process of initiating cost saving measures at both the Sands and the Venetian property in Macao, and we have accelerated those and are seeking to drive even higher cost savings than the 60 or $70 million we've talked about our previous calls.</p>
          <p>The Venetian Macao came in at $136 million of EBITDAR. Little bit of a different story there. Some very good operating metrics at that property and I think if we talk about first visitation. Visitation in the third quarter averaged a record 72,000 people per day. That's up from about 56,000 in the second quarter. Our ferry occupancy as you know, we started our ferry operations at the beginning of the year, they've been ramping up.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we are able to start running a half hour schedule that made our, that added capacity and also, at the same time, made our service more competitive, and we ran 60% in the third quarter. In October, we actually ran just under 65% and moved 502,000 passengers on our ferries during the month of October.</p>
          <p>After the first of the year, we'll be adding more ferry capacity and moving to a 15 minute scheduled frequency that matches that of our competitors &#x2013; the TurboJET operation. This is important from two standpoints, one, we will get added capacity particularly during those peak periods, which we can sell several times over. At the same time, we will get a frequency that makes our service more competitive in terms of schedule. Schedule is very important to the customer over there. As far as the individual businesses go within the Venetian, the Rolling Chip volume &#x2013; I'm going to talk now quarter to quarter because the comparisons to the third quarter of last year really don't make any sense.</p>
          <p>So rather than talk about quarter-to-quarter &#x2013; year-over-year, we'll talk quarter-to-quarter. We were at 9.9 million of rolling drop in the second quarter this year, 9.8 this year, so virtually flat. We set a record in the third quarter on our non-rolling business. We actually did $931 million of drop in the non-rolling program. That's the highest we've seen to-date, 50-some million over the first quarter, which is our next highest quarter. Nice jump over the $852 million last year. And our hold percentage on the both businesses were within our expected range.</p>
          <p>Our rolling business, as I said, stayed flat. Our commissions were approximately the same quarter-over-quarter. We didn't see any increase in commission pressure as far as that goes. Handle, we did &#x2013; we came in at 550 million slot handle, again a record for us as we take the passenger counts and we take the visitation and translate that into both into volume at the gaming floor, that was up 23% from the prior quarter of 447 million. So a nice growth there and a 18% hold increase in our win in that area.</p>
          <p>We also achieved a record hotel occupancy in the third quarter, 92%. We are &#x2013; that's up from 80% in the second quarter. We are using a lot of those rooms promotionally. We're taking advantage of the fact that we have a unique product. And rather than having the rooms go empty, we have increased our &#x2013; the amount of rooms that we put out into the casino and it's translated again into win. Again, with a $211 average rate.</p>
          <p>Group business was down as one would expect in the summertime period, but, again, we are please of the move &#x2013; the ability to drive a 92% occupancy. One thing I would note quarter-over-quarter is we were down slightly in EBITDAR from the previous quarter with slight increased revenues. We had two things that affected us in the third quarter, first of all was a hit of roughly $8.5 million on the entertainment side; we had a major event &#x2013; we sponsored the U.S. Basketball team for the Beijing Olympics. It was a long term positioner for us and the net cost of $3 million incremental cost and loss in the quarter in what we call the arena area. And also we started up the Cirque du Soleil show in the July timeframe and during that period which was the rehearsal type shows, the preview type shows, we weren't able to drive the visitation to that show and yet we incurred costs that we weren't able to classify as pre-opening. So we lost money there as well.</p>
          <p>So about an $8 million, $8.3 million loss in the entertainment side. Additionally, we started charging ourself a different accounting methodology on the ferries. And we actually increased the cost of a ferry and our marketing cost about $8 million quarter-over-quarter. So about $16 million roughly in adjustments quarter-over-quarter of expenses we didn't incur in the second quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>At the Venetian itself, I think the thing we need to recognize there are two things. One, the same cost cutting we talked about in &#x2013; taking place at the Sands is also taking place at the Venetian. As we take that property and mature it and learn more about the market, and learn how to be more efficient in operating the hotel and the casino in that immense property, which is of course is unique in all of Asia. So that is going on.</p>
          <p>And additionally, I think the terms of the IVS scheme, I think we should state that, we did a study of Macao University and roughly 58% of the people on the casino floors in Macao in general are &#x2013; come out of the Mainland China. We said from the beginning that one of the strategies around the Cotai strip was to broaden the markets and appeal to more of an international visitor and I think we've started to achieve that. I mean the occupancy on our floor for the same study was about 31%. We're much more dependent on Hong Kong and Taiwan and other international destinations than the majority of the operators including our own Sands in Macao, because of our hotel product and the size of that product and the retail etcetera and event centers.</p>
          <p>So we are a bit insulated, while, certainly the Venetian was affected. And again, I think if you look quarter-to-quarter, performance would have been better had we not had to face the visa restrictions in the third quarter of '08. So &#x2013; but again I think the good news is that the Venetian is more insulated than most in terms of its dependency on the mainland customer and thus the changes in the IVS visitation scheme.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, you mentioned the IVS scheme and its effect on the third quarter. You mentioned that the ferries ran a little over 60% in the third quarter. How about October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned that we were at about 65% occupancy and 502,000 passengers in the month of October. So, and again, we're seeing that business continue to ramp up despite &#x2013; what's amazing about that is we also have a situation where the visa that was both a Hong Kong, Macao visa has been &#x2013; has temporarily been eliminated and now you have to get a direct visa to both. So it's kind of bucking the trend in terms of what you would expect based upon the visa restrictions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on my math, we're up about 15.4% in passengers in October over the average for third quarter. Thanks Brad. Rob, do you have a couple of other comments for me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize. We should mention again Las Vegas. We have an extensive cost cutting program underway. Starting in the third quarter of '08, our cumulative target is $100 million of reductions. And they range from things like FTE reductions that started quite a while back. Programs, polices, procedures. And again, the cumulative result, we'll end up in the second quarter of '09 will be about $100 million in cost savings. We think will insulate us against the continued downturn, revenue side at least we'll guarantee we can hit our projections on the EBITDAR targets for '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>When we talk to investors, Rob, we talked a bit about &#x2013; we usually don't talk about forward looking things and don't make forecasts, but in interest of making sure we're broadly disseminating. We talked a bit about October and November, some of the metrics there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you bring us up-to-date on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think you referenced them earlier, but just &#x2013; again, October was not a &#x2013; it was good month. I think relatively speaking, about $36 million EBITDAR. And ADR 224, again the issue is just the downturn in ADR versus the October 7. Table drop held up pretty well and the win about $38 million and slots at $18 million, which is a nice growth year-to-year. Our banquet business held up well. And I think October, November indicate with cost cutting, etc., the challenges will be the ADR but perhaps we can buffer that with our cost cutting programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, fellows. I'm kind of rolling forward, here this is a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you didn't catch. That was a repeat catch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. One other thing that we wanted to talk about and again, we do not normally give guidance, but as part of this process, we talked about our expected results in 2012. And on a forecast basis, we broke it down by property in terms of where we see ourselves. In 2012, we are forecasting somewhere in the area of $289 million of EBITDA on the Venetian Las Vegas. To give you an idea about where we are going here, the Venetian did 341 million in 2007 and 293 million in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>By 2012, we see this market recovering. Obviously, we see a trough in '09. And so we're being very judicious about how we are forecasting EBITDA in these next ensuing and particularly 18 months. We are forecasting in 2012 to do about 258 million out of the Palazzo. Now the Palazzo has been ramping up. And as Rob had mentioned in the third quarter, we did about $44 million of EBITDA. Now, out of the Palazzo, the Palazzo held about 17% on an expectation of 21%. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>18.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>18.5 &#x2013; excuse me. So it is somewhat depressed, but we think that the Palazzo is ramping up nicely, and by 2012 should return to $258 million run rate of EBITDA on our target for 2012. Sands Bethworks, we believe will generate over $150 million of EBITDA in 2012 discounting back to 2009, obviously, lower than that as we're 2009. We held the Sands Exhibition Center to be flat at $20 million of EBITDA. In Macao, we've forecast the Venetian Macao to run $625 million of EBITDA in target of 2012. That's on the last 12 months of 504 and then the last six months run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Run rate over the list six months as we've added the ferries and put in certain programs, our cost is about 552.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>About 552 on an annualized run rate for the last six months. Sands Macao, we're forecasting to be essentially flat with our last 12 months of '08 at 239. In 2012, we believe the Four Seasons Macao ramps to about a 140 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>And the most important, I guess, you'd say adjustment and thing that we were able to actually talk about is actually table capacity at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We initially had forecast about 600 table capacity there to take a very conservative approach when we initially bid. We have been allowed to now say that our plans for our table layouts could accommodate up to 1,000 tables. And the government has indicated that based on their approvals, 1,000 tables might be the capacity that we'd be able to operate under. That has had significant impact on our forecast for 2012. And we forecast in 2012 to generate 1.259 billion of EBITDA out of the Singapore operation.</p>
          <p>With that, I want to turn it back over to Brad so he can talk through how it is we arrived at that value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for illustrative purposes, one thing I think that people have to understand and recognize is the huge advantage of the tax regime that we enjoy in Singapore versus that perhaps for example at Macao. We've just did some exercises where we took the last 12 months gaming win in Macao, which is approximately $2 billion at the Venetian Macao rather and looked at that tax effective rate. And if you look at the &#x2013; what 2 billion in Macao yields, we'd have to pay $785 million of taxes against that $2 billion.</p>
          <p>For illustration purposes, we said if we did the same two billion in Marina Bay Sands, and again with our number of tables and the duopoly, almost monopoly that we have in that jurisdiction, we feel we can exceed those numbers. The effective tax rate when we blend the VIP mix of business and that of mass is about 17.3%. So in that jurisdiction, against the same revenue, we would have paid $347 million in taxes.</p>
          <p>That's a difference in taxes of the EBITDA line on a Macao-type number of $436 million just by itself. We talked about the fact that the run rate of the Venetian is about 552 over the last six months, but assuming we used the last 12 months during the ramp up period of Venetian, we did $504 million of EBITDA. And just the tax difference alone on the same exact gaming revenues would have taken &#x2013; would have made a difference of 436 million and you would have run if the Venetian were located <mark type="inaudible" /> $940 million of EBITDA in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, there is more units in Singapore. You're in a monopoly. I think the things that one has to understand about Singapore is while there's 31 casinos in Macao, there's only two in Singapore. Singapore has a very mature international infrastructure of hotel rooms. There's over 20,000 four and five star hotel rooms. In Singapore, 40,000 rooms in total versus less than 10,000 four and five star hotel rooms in Macao.</p>
          <p>The resident population of Singapore is 4.6 million people, 70% of which are Chinese versus a population of 550,000 in Macao. I think what's important about that number, we talked about people who don't need to get visas or go through customs or go through that in order to be right in the gaming jurisdiction. Probably the most important statistic, or one of the most important is the fact that yes, in 2007, there were 27,000 visitors in Macao &#x2013; million, sorry, I get that always wrong. There were 10.3 million visitors in Singapore. And what you here is kind of the phenomenon for those you who've been covering gaming is what we always saw in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. And that is Atlantic City was planning to have more visitations than Las Vegas and that was true terms of visitations. The difference was that people in Atlantic City stayed 1.1 day and they stayed 3.5 days in Las Vegas. So you had many more visitor days in Las Vegas.</p>
          <p>Same thing is true when you look at the Macao and Singapore statistics. The average overnight visitor in Macao stays 1.4 days, the average day trip visitor stays about 1.1 day. So I think that blends out to just over 30 million visits and when you take the four million or so overnight stays and multiply them out. Singapore, meanwhile, and Bill has that number, is roughly 35 &#x2013; 36 million visitor days when you take the 10.3 million times 3.6 actually a little higher than that, almost 37 million</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>37.1 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>37.1 million visitor days. So, actually more visitor days in Singapore that in 2007 and in Macao. So we think it's a wonderful market. In our forecast, we looked out at 2012 and anticipate a 90% occupancy in our hotel there, at a $260 ADR and currently five star hotels in Singapore year-to-date in '08 are running 278.</p>
          <p>So we're projecting $18 less four years from now in Singapore for a similar type hotel product. And again we fill that mall based upon its rentals to date will generate an NOI in excess of $200 million, or EBITDA in the area of $200 million. So when you take the rooms, you take the mall, you take the number of units we going to be able to put on the floor, with a very favorable tax regime, we come up with a number that is in the range of $1.25 billion.</p>

          <p>There is one other statistic that I want to make sure we distribute broadly here as we're speaking also to investors, our forecast for phase five and six, or pardon me, sites five and six in Macao, our 2012 estimate was about $533 million of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So with that, I think we have covered our discussions fairly broadly on our current capital raise. We've discussed our third quarter results and with that, I'll just open it up for questions for any member of our management team.</p>

          <p>I was there most recently. I think what you have to look at there is this scheduled policy address to take place tomorrow, which is 3:30 in the afternoon Macao time. There is a major policy address, to be given to the legislative council. And on the next day, there will be a question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>The expectation is that there will be a &#x2013; they will address the issue of what we call taxes, what they call contribution to the Macao Fund, focusing mainly on the 4%. They're talking about providing help to different companies in the Macao economy, to guarantee loans at banks for different SMEs, small and medium enterprises, and other issues including the consideration of when and how much they're going to announce the cap on the junket on commission rates. So, we're not in a position to tell you, but the market will be in a position to know within the next 48 hours.</p>

          <p>I think there was a fairly board communication of a stimulus package in mainland China itself. It was a pretty aggressive program of building roads and things in the rural area. Additionally, Wen Jiabao announced his support for the Hong Kong and the Macao economies. So I think we'll be seeing call it stimulus packages or economy improvement packages coming out of the SARs. And that with this one from Macao, as Sheldon mentioned, coincide with the policy address &#x2013; the bi-annual policy address that's scheduled tomorrow with the Chief Executive.</p>
          <p>Wen Jiabao, just after that, they announced additional openings of IVS visitation schemes that would allow people from the capital, the large city in the western part, kind of the mid-northwestern part of China, allowing them to access the IVS scheme and come more easily, more often to Macao. There's also speculation about easing the current regulations related to Guangdong province as it relates to the IVS scheme.</p>

          <p>All right. As far as convention pre-bookings, MGM had talked about they have more pre-bookings in '09 now than they did a year ago for '08. Any feel, Rob, for how convention bookings, advanced bookings are going?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, the market is soft. We had &#x2013; all our groups, one-by-one by one through the balance of 2009, we've already seen &#x2013; cancellations are baked into our projections. We're hoping for a recovery of the whole sector. Cleary, there's two pressures, one is on FIT rates and wholesale rates in general and, two is on the overall group market, which is down year-on-year a few points.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we think that sector can recover. We're not talking about the car business or the financials, but perhaps we see growth in pharmaceuticals, we still see growth in insurance. There are some bright spots, but we re-project our numbers, Larry, to be sub-30% of the mix will be group, as opposed to our typical 40-42%, 43%.</p>
          <p>So right now it's a little quiet and I think you'd expect it to be with what's happening in the world today. But I think that will recover and it's a question of how long it takes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the only thing I'd add that is that as we shed group rooms in place of FIT wholesale or casino rooms, we do have the opportunity, I think Bill or Rob mentioned this earlier, of driving more gaming revenue. The group business does put a drag somewhat on our gaming revenues. And as rooms become available, we can &#x2013; we still believe we'll run the high occupancies we've always run. We've never had a challenge filling this hotel. It's always been a challenge of what rate we get. And we'll make surely we utilize those rooms to drive as much other revenue that is perhaps compromising the rate a little bit in the banquet business and replacing it with gaming revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, I'd like to say coming from the convention business, convention organizers normally see their longest radar encompasses the next event. So if you have an annual or semiannual trade show, for an example, all they care about is the next show. So, if you're in a first half of one year and your show is in the second half of the year, that's the time that they make a go or no go decision based upon economic conditions. If it's the following year, they wait till the second half. So, typically, it's about six months away before a trade show and convention go or no go decisions are made, but I could tell you that their crystal ball only goes for the next show. So if the next show is six months or a year away, that's how far the crystal ball goes.</p>
          <p>And so we're hoping, for instance, the trade show is going to book for a particular year. Those that have not canceled already will hold and those that have canceled will certainly be looking for the alternate year that the second show to come. I have a piece &#x2013; I think I lost it. There was an article in one of the newspapers in the Macao Daily News that talked about the government &#x2013; no, I don't have it &#x2013; that talked about the government announcing yesterday that they were going to provide a package of relief to the &#x2013; to the market &#x2013; but I'm sorry I can't find it. If I do find it before the call is over, I'll read out the short paragraph.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have about, currently in the third quarter and fourth quarter and first half of '09, we have about $12 million of rents coming on board and we'll collect those rents and keep them if growth can't <mark type="inaudible" /> bought those rents. So we'll keep them &#x2013; sell them to a possible buyer emerging for those assets. If Growth sells them, that buyer will accept the commercial terms of the deal, which means we get some kind of a payment for those about <mark type="inaudible" /> with $200 million payment will be due us, offset by softness in the mall because there has been obviously the retail market is difficult. So there is a couple hundred million dollars of opportunity there if in fact someone buys the assets from General Growth and they are marketing those assets as we speak.</p>

          <p>I don't know if you'll be able to answer my first question. But with the capital commitment that you've discussed and the cash on the balance sheet, I calculate you guys having around $3.6 billion of cash. Can you just talk about how you see your sources and uses over the next 12 to 18 months, particularly given the delays and particularly given the $900 million you discussed, cost to delay sites five and six?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost of delays site five and six, that's mostly construction in the pipeline. I think we quoted 800 &#x2013; total number of 881 million. That anticipates a full shutdown of the project. There are some costs in there that anticipate that there are some contractual obligations that need to be paid out that don't manifest themselves in bricks or sticks or in elevators or whatever other specially items are in the pipeline. But most of that expenditure are on things that assumedly, when we restart, we actually use.</p>
          <p>If we are able to achieve a project financing, then a portion of that flows into that financing overall as part of the completion of the project.

          <p>And that doesn't include the sale of any retail. We have two retail malls whose &#x2013; we have two retail malls that are up and operating today. As we speak on this conference call. One brings somewhere between 35 and 40 million, I am sorry I don't know the exact number. The other one brings in 130 million. So provide 165 million whatever cap rate we can get on that. Now clearly as the time goes by, we think the cap rates hopefully will improve or they may deteriorate. But these are trophy malls. They are one of a kind malls and people that have heard about them or seen them, particularly the Four Seasons Mall, they are extraordinarily impressed.</p>
          <p>We will be developing a mall on lots five and six when we get that done. And on Singapore, the mall will generate approximately 200 to 230 million somewhere in that category. If the rate that we're signing up about half of the tenets now holds up, we'll have about somewhere between 200 to 220 million. So they'll have debt of about 4 billion, so if things get back to normal, we will be able to sell that mall and essentially pay for the entire Singapore property.</p>

          <p>What's being missed here and talked about is the absence of people just neglecting or forgetting, a fundamental business strategy to build core and non-core properties. Sell of the non-core properties, still keep the benefit of it, like the malls as an attraction one of the amenities. And then pay off the financing. The estimates of '12 are certainly the most extraordinarily conservative estimates we've come up with. I don't know that there is anybody who can accurately thread the needle on what's going to happen in four or five years from now, but we have to take some conservative approach. So the approach we take is extraordinarily conservative.</p>

          <p>What we did was <mark type="audio gap" /> considering that they're approximately the same demographics in the marketplace, in the pertinent marketplace. We even put in a 1.35 junket rate commission schedule for a very high percentage of the gross income. I know that it looks like an aggressive program, but I tell you we've scrubbed those numbers six ways to Sunday and it's difficult to get it down. We know that we had a backup with some sort of experience, so we used the opening of the Sands. We matched the number of tables that are in the marketplace both in Singapore against the Macao marketplace and that's what we come up with. I know you're going to find it, somewhat it may look aggressive, but we did our best.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then one final question for Brad going back to the Venetian Macao in the third quarter, can you comment on the business or the direct versus the VIP business? Did you have much improvement on the direct side of things? I know it's one initiatives that you talk about a quarter ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've seen improvement in that business. I mean overall our volumes have stayed relatively flat. We are moving towards that, we are looking at issuing more credit in that region, particularly in Honk Kong and Taiwan. The business is ramping up relative to the other business, but junkets still play a dominant role. One of the things we are going to look to use the Four Seasons for is to, especially once we open the Paiza mansions in the first quarter, is to target that direct player. So we made some inroads, Joe, but we are nowhere near where we want to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks I had a couple of questions. First, on Singapore, it sounds like you are still talking about a late '09 opening but it sounds like the entire project won't be opening in '08, '09. So, if you could just clarify sort of what will be opening in that sort of first phase and how much capital is needed for that? And then it sounded like you said that the 2 billion in capital you've raised will cover Singapore as well. Did you mean it's just going to cover your 20% equity contribution and you will still need to get additional credit financing for that or does that cover the entire amount of the budget increase here that you're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the loan in Singapore funds as we found our equity portion of it. So, we are only talking about the equity portion of what needs to be contributed to Singapore to complete Singapore. And by opening of Singapore you are just talking about the difference, it's about $0.5 billion total to the end, quote unquote, but it's 400 &#x2013; something near 427 million by the time Singapore opens late '09, early 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That actually takes us through the first &#x2013; the end of the first quarter of '10, Robin</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then what would be &#x2013; what parts will be opening in late '09 and what parts in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are anticipating opening in the late '09 early '10 timeframe. I think we're going to get two of the towers open with the exception of the suites. We're roughly estimating for projection purposes about 1,000 rooms. Hoping that will be higher than that. A portion of the mall will be open under that scenario and the casino will be open under that scenario, as well as the majority of the MICE space. We will open the rest of the rooms through the first into the second quarter. By the end of the second quarter, we do expect to have all the rooms online. The majority of the retail space is available, but of course that's always available for tenant bid-out. And then moving probably into the third quarter of '09 would be the theaters and the art and science museum.</p>
          <p>So at the &#x2013; when we open the property, the majority of the physical, what I'll call structural pieces and everything else will be in place. But as usual, fitting out a hotel, particularly suites, will take place later on. The Sky Park which is a very complicated piece &#x2013; we don't get to it until we top off the buildings would be open sometime probably in the mid of the second quarter. So, the property will be &#x2013; have its casino, a large array of rooms and restaurants, retail and most of the public spaces opened when we open the facility at the end of '09, beginning of '10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Robin, you asked the question about any remaining pieces from a financing perspective. The only piece that we're programming in is the &#x2013; a little over $300 million of FF&amp;E financing which we targeted for the late in 2009. We have already started working with two providers for that. We had originally programmed in some bond financing as well. We've taken that out of the program completely. And there is additional cushion in the program so that if we're not able to raise the full $300 million of FF&amp;E financing, we're still covered for the proceeds from the deal we just did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you don't need to do additional, other than the $300 million FF&amp;E, you will not need to do other capital raising for Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then also just to clarify on sites five and six. In Macao, can you just clarify, including these shutdown costs of 880 million and the receivables and all that, including that and understanding that some that does not have to be paid out for few quarters. But including that how much will have you spent at this point on sites five and six? And then how much would you need at that point, after that 808 million to complete it, phase one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The amount spent today is 1,158 million as of September 30 and then portions of that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We'll have about 400 million on top of that, that we will spend as part of this 881 million we talked about and then we would, the number above that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On top of that, it would be about another &#x2013; about approximately 1.7, 1.8 million to open the phase one of the property.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to determine exactly, Robin, because if we do &#x2013; if the project is being suspended actually does go through a shutdown before we achieve the completion of the project financing, there are going to be start-up costs, restart costs as well and we haven't determined exactly what those are yet. And I am going to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm assuming that we end up going to a suspension but don't get termination that's based on raising of project financing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a difference in the contracts between suspension and termination. A suspension is that we like leave a lot of stuff there and the contracts are still ongoing but there is a hiatus for a period of time. We have up to a six month extension. A termination of the work is to stop the project all together. We are hopeful we have made commitment not a &#x2013; we have a term sheet from a Chinese bank that accounts in milestone somewhere between 5 to $700 million out of an approximately 1.5 to $2 billion project finance.</p>
          <p>Now if we can wrap that up and we get help from the government as they say in this news article or they just see that the parent company requirements have been satisfied and we might be able to get that, then it will be &#x2013; we will hardly miss a step. We are sending somebody who is sending a team to &#x2013; I was there through Thursday and Friday. I left there Friday, got back here Friday. And we are moving alone quite aggressively and we are hoping that we can solve that problem. The Macao Government has encouraged the Chinese banks to along with us. And we will see over the next visit whether or not we get that. It could very well be we may not stop at all. We may not let say suspend at all. But that's still to be determined.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Okay great thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, we can also slow down as opposed to total suspension.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great and then just a last question just to clarify one of the projections you gave, just to make sure I have it right, did you say that in 2012, that the nation Macao, you are expecting to be, it sounded like it was about 125 million higher than its current run rate. I don't know if you heard it right and are you assuming everything else in Macao in terms of competitor, supply that's been announced, are you assuming that all financed that comes online with part of that 2012 projection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the projection we talked about for 2012 was 625 million. I think we said earlier, we certainly look as we ramp up the property. The last six months as we've been the mature, we were about 550 million of EBITDA in 2008. We see with other</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other annualized basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other annualized basis last two quarters. We see that the with the ferry service being increasing, the competition, a lot of the competition is going to take place in our backyard of Cotai, which is the city of dreams perhaps. Five and six by then and we see that only as positive for us. We think that establishes Cotai as a very strong district. We believe in critical mass. And we don't see a whole lot other competition coming on in the peninsula. There simply isn't very much land or places to do anything of any significance. So we think the 625 in 2012 &#x2013; as we were still ramping up the Venetian and we're running a 550 or so run rate over the last six months is an achievable number. Especially as we put cost reductions in place etcetera and we just learn to utilize the asset better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also one point of clarification, Robin, I just want to make sure you didn't &#x2013; something you had said earlier. I want to make sure you don't have the wrong impression. Of that $881 million for the five and six for, as Brad calls it draconian shutdown, suspension to shutdown program, we don't get the $600 million of that until the end of the third quarter, okay, of 2009. I think Brad mentioned about $400 million of that is where we'd be by the end of the first quarter of 2009. So please don't assume that we spend $800 million in the next 60 days or the next 90 days, you have to assume that we don't get to that level until 2010 second quarter. Okay.</p>
