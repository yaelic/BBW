          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS full year earnings 2011 conference call. Louis Gallois, our CEO, and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about 1 hour and 30 minutes. This includes Q&amp;A, which will be conducted after the initial presentation. This call is also webcast. You can access the IR homepage, where we have set a special banner. Playback of this call will be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service.</p>
          <p>The supporting information package was e-mailed to you earlier this morning. It includes the slides which we will now work through and financial statements. Through this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement which applies to this call as well. You should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>And now, to Louis Gallois.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philippe. Welcome, everyone. Let me start by summarizing the year 2011. It was a good year for the EADS group. Performance was stronger than expected. Clearly, the macroeconomic context was volatile. Worldwide growth slowed and the sovereign debt crisis led to widespread concerns. Government budgets came under increased pressure yet passenger traffic figures were resilient.</p>
          <p>Despite the changing environment, EADS once again grew and improved its financial performance. This, in our view, is a tribute to the prudence with which we run our business and thanks to our strong backlog management, with regional focus on growing economies. Our commercial success is testimony to our strong product policy, our technical innovation and global reach.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we achieved record delivery figures and a record order intake, driven by exceptional demand for both single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft. The new eco-efficient A320NEO was a commercial star and undisputed benchmark in the single-aisle segment. EADS therefore moves into a newer role of leadership with strong momentum. I believe this momentum will help generate healthy improvement in underlying profit during 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We met progress along our strategy path. As you're aware, we made service expansion a key element of our strategy. Our businesses have been highly successful in such areas as fleet maintenance, system support, and satellite services.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we have taken further step to extend in services. We have both satellite communications provider Vizada and helicopter maintenance expert Vector, both of which have strong North American customer base. We also bought Satair, a provider of cutting-edge logistic solutions, and Metron, a U.S. company specialized in air traffic management solutions. We continue to monitor opportunities on a similar or even larger scale. The philosophy behind these acquisitions reflects that we are looking for businesses which fit our competence and which help us to gain access to new markets worldwide.</p>
          <p>Our major programs also progressed. Production rate increases on the single aisle and long-range family are well underway despite the ramp-up's challenges. Due to the positive order momentum, Airbus has decided to ramp up production on the A330 to rate 11 in Q2 2014, provided the Emission Trading Scheme issue does not harm aircraft orders. Series production of the A380 ramped up in 2011 above two deliveries per month. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:42) advanced towards certification and the start of final assembly of the first aircraft for the French customer.</p>
          <p>We remain fully focused on the execution of our key programs, especially the A350 XWB. While we cannot exclude risk on such complex development programs and we know that a lot of difficult challenges are ahead of us, I believe that our efforts in the area of program and risk management are paying off. It is another positive development to settle on side our continued growth momentum that brings me to our next slide.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 success builds the hallmark of our well known strengths, continued by global growth, strong revenues and a very healthy net cash position. EADS remains a cash machine. Our backlog was boosted by record orders for commercial aircraft.</p>
          <p>The broad geographic distribution of our backlog reflecting, in particular, the strength of the emerging economies is an additional source of stability. We also saw notable progress at Eurocopter. I am very pleased to see that the recovery in the civilian helicopter market is gathering pace, as witnessed by the 191 helicopter orders announced by Eurocopter at the expo in early 2012.</p>
          <p>Our revenues improved in 2011, fueled by record deliveries. Global air passenger traffic continues to grow, driven in particular by Asian emerging markets. Based on this, demand for commercial aircraft remains robust. We anticipate that this trend will continue. It is a big offset against the flat defense sales in our own markets. I'm sorry I have to drink something to be better understood.</p>
          <p>Clearly, European banks are facing higher cost to access U.S. dollars, the main aircraft financing currency. Nevertheless, higher margins made aircraft financing more attractive to financial institutions that have access to U.S. dollar. Leasing companies in particular played an important role in providing liquidity to the airline industry, financing around 40% of Airbus deliveries in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our cash position remains very healthy as a result of the recent spate of orders, increased deliveries, and improved profitability. We continue to have a strong and better than expected cash inflow. We are actively looking for the best uses for our cash while ensuring we continue to have the flexibility to make the right moves.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to ask Hans Peter to look at our financial achievements in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We are on page five now, where you will see how our 2011 financials exceeded expectations. The 320NEO became the fastest-selling jet in history. Thanks mainly to this success, Airbus orders in 2011 were more than three times the level expected at the beginning of the year. Airbus, again, demonstrated its sound management of backlog by successfully achieving another record for deliveries despite fears about the financial environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBIT before one-off, we were also clearly above guidance, thanks to a better performance across all divisions. As the operational improvements flows through to the net income, we significantly beat our guidance for EPS before one-off.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow performance far exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the year, driven by better operational performance, stronger pre-delivery payments at Airbus Commercial, lower CapEx, and lower customer financing requirements than expected.</p>
          <p>Up to slide six now with the financial highlights, our revenues grew by around 7%. Volume and mix effects at Airbus and increased commercial activity at Eurocopter, including Vector revenues, more than offset a slight decrease at Astrium and Cassidian. The overall 2011 revenue contribution from the first consolidation of the major acquisitions was around &#x20AC;300 million, mainly from Vector Aerospace and Satair, while the EBIT impact was insignificant.</p>
          <p>The EBIT, before one-off, stands at around &#x20AC;1.8 billion for EADS and around &#x20AC;530 million for Airbus. Compared to 2010, this represents a significant rise despite an increase in R&amp;D expense and dollar headwinds. EBIT before one-off benefited from good performance in Airbus legacy programs. Thanks to volume, mix and price improvements. Airbus military contributed, as did Eurocopter in particular, due to the performance improvement from its commercial series and services activity.</p>
          <p>Order intake of &#x20AC;131 billion was significantly above the 2010 level, driven by the higher level of commercial aircraft orders at Airbus. Our order book of a record &#x20AC;541 billion underpins our top line growth into the future. The Airbus commercial backlog benefited from a positive revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;15 billion due to the U.S. dollar closing spot rate that has strengthened since year-end.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is 3.6% at group level, which is a significant first step towards higher profitability. At Airbus commercial, a higher number of deliveries and better pricing more than compensated hedge rate deterioration and higher R&amp;D. The total one-time effects at Airbus were roughly neutral. A negative impact from the A350 XWB provision was more than offset by the effects from the A340 termination and by positive FX impact on PDP mismatch and balance sheet revaluation.</p>
          <p>The other divisions' performance includes around &#x20AC;200 million net in negative one-time items. This is partially compensated by positive one-offs in other businesses and headquarters. The largest proportion is in Eurocopter, which has reported roughly &#x20AC;115 million of negative one-time effects, driven mainly by governmental programs and charges for SHAPE.</p>
          <p>Cassidian booked a net charge of &#x20AC;72 million for restructuring and programs. At Astrium a restructuring charge of &#x20AC;23 million was booked in Q4 relating to the AGILE transformation program. EADS headquarters EBIT before one-off improved in 2011, mainly due to an increased allocation of management fees to divisions and positive impacts from group eliminations in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now we are on slide eight. R&amp;D rose versus last year by &#x20AC;213 million, driven mainly by increases at Airbus on the A350 XWB development, Cassidian for UAS, and Eurofighter radar activities as well as at Eurocopter. The interest result has improved compared to 2010, mainly due to higher interest income related to the good cash performance. The 2011 interest result includes a positive one-time release of &#x20AC;120 million due to the termination of the A340 program.</p>
          <p>The other financial result is negative by &#x20AC;233 million. This line includes, among others, the negative revaluation of our FX options for around &#x20AC;90 million and the unwinding of discounted provisions for a negative &#x20AC;172 million. The tax rate, nominally around 30%, is lower in 2011 at 26% following a positive impact from a reassessment of tax risks.</p>
          <p>The operational improvements are slowing down, with an 87% increase of the net income to &#x20AC;1.033 million. In our half year release, we introduced a net income before one-off, stripping out EBIT one-offs and the revaluation of U.S. dollar and pound assets as well as the revaluation of our options. In addition, it excludes the positive one-off in the interest result due to the termination of the A340 program of &#x20AC;120 million.</p>
          <p>The 2011 EPS before one-off stands at &#x20AC;1.31. You can see the material improvement of the underlying performance compared to last year. We have provided the detail of this driver for you in the appendix slide 26.</p>
          <p>Now we go to the hedging slide in page nine. In Q4, we were able to take advantage of the strengthening U.S. dollar by accelerating our hedging activity, adding $8.9 billion worth of hedges at an average rate of $1.34 per &#x20AC;1. In 2011, while $19.1 billion worth of hedges matured at an average rate of $1.37 per &#x20AC;1, we replenished the portfolio with $23 billion worth of new forward contracts and an improved rate of $1.36 per &#x20AC;1. We also implemented more than $1 billion worth of options maturing in 2013.</p>
          <p>Our hedge book increased from $70.2 billion at the end of 2010 to $75.1 billion at the end of December 2011. At year-end, the mark-to-market value of our hedge portfolio was negative at around minus &#x20AC;2.4 billion before tax compared to a negative &#x20AC;1.9 billion at the end of December 2010. This movement is driven by the evolution of the closing spot rate from $1.34 per &#x20AC;1 in December 2010 to $1.29 for the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>In addition to our traditional hedging activity, contracting with certain airlines in euro is progressing. More than $5 billion of revenues for aircrafts to be delivered between 2012 and 2016 have been converted into euro, thus reducing our dollar foreign exchange exposure by the same amount.</p>
          <p>Now to our cash flow on slide 10, free cash flow after customer financing and before acquisitions at &#x20AC;2.5 billion is significantly above expectations, thanks to higher order intake and higher-than-expected deliveries at Airbus, better EBIT before one-off and better-than-expected cash inflow from government customers. Gross cash flow from operations increased compared to one year ago, mainly due to the improvement of profitability before depreciation and provisioning.</p>
          <p>The working capital includes an inventory increase at Airbus due to the progressive ramp-up on production programs. The ramp-up in inventories was overcompensated by a higher advanced payment received at Airbus.</p>
          <p>Customer financing generated cash of &#x20AC;135 million, as the lessor and global banking market continues to be active despite recent concerns. The level of industrial capital expenditure is slightly below the 2010 level. In line with our strategy, we pursued some significant acquisitions during 2011 with an overall cash-out of approximately &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The net cash position amounts to a solid &#x20AC;11.7 billion after acquisitions and a cash contribution to pension assets of &#x20AC;489 billion.</p>
          <p>And now Louis will talk you through the performance of the Airbus division in more detail, and it starts on page 12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Peter. In 2011, Airbus Commercial increased production for the 10th year in a row, delivering 534 aircraft to customers. Airbus Military also achieved a record, with 29 deliveries including six MRTT.</p>
          <p>Revenues at the Airbus division level rose by 10% to &#x20AC;33.1 billion, mainly driven by the delivery increase. Self-financed R&amp;D at Airbus division level rose slightly to &#x20AC;2.5 billion due, mainly to the A350. The division EBIT stood at &#x20AC;584 million, representing a 91% increase on the previous year.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, 2011 was a record year for Airbus Commercial in terms of order intake, with 1,419 net orders. The A320NEO alone won 1,226 new firm orders.</p>
          <p>The Airbus commercial backlog rose 25% year on year to 4,437 units, which represents an industry record. In value terms, the Airbus commercial order book of &#x20AC;475 billion benefited from a positive revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;15 billion due to the strengthening value of the U.S. dollar against the euro at the end of 2011 versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 13, where we take a closer look at what is driving the overall increase in revenues at Airbus. Compared to a year ago, Airbus commercial revenues benefited mainly from a favorable volume and a mix effect which included a higher number of A320 family and A380 deliveries and a pricing improvement. The negative impact on revenues from foreign exchange is around &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>Airbus Commercial EBIT before one-off benefited from operational improvement, including a favorable pricing effect. The improvement year on year is partially reduced by hedge rate deterioration of around &#x20AC;200 million and higher R&amp;D expenses, particularly for the A350 XWB program.</p>
          <p>At Airbus Military, the revenue decreased by minus 7%. It's due to lower revenue recognition for the A400M. Nevertheless, Airbus Military EBIT increased significantly due to a favorable mix, operational improvements and overhead cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Progress has also been made in the major programs. The increase of the production rates of single aisle and long-range family is well under way despite the ramp-up challenges. Due to the positive order momentum, Airbus has decided to ramp up production of the A330 to rate 11 in Q2 2014, provided the emission trading scheme issue does not harm aircraft orders.</p>
          <p>26 A380 aircraft were delivered, exceeding our targets. This is a clear indication that the program is on track. We are currently devoting maximum attention to solving the wing rib feet crack issues. The cost to fix this issue will be borne by Airbus, and an estimate has been provided for within the warranty provisioning for the aircraft delivered.</p>
          <p>The A350 XWB program is advancing. Major sections of the A350 arrived in the final assembly line in Toulouse at the end of 2011. In February 2012, the A350 Trent engine made its successful first flight on a A380 Flying Test Bed. Entry into service is scheduled for H1 2014. The program is very challenging. The schedule is tightening as Airbus progresses towards its next milestones, particularly entry into FAL.</p>
          <p>Flight testing on the A400M continues at maximum capacity, with five aircraft for timely achievement of the first customer delivery. Final assembly of the first customer aircraft has started in Seville. In 2011, we also delivered the first six cutting-edge MRTT tanker aircraft.</p>
          <p>Finally, Airbus confirmed its service strategy in 2011 by acquiring Denmark-based Satair, as well as U.S.-based Metron Aviation, a provider of advanced air traffic management solutions.</p>
          <p>And now, Hans Peter, for the other divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We are now, yes, I lead you through the other divisions and I'll start with Eurocopter on page 14. Eurocopter beat expectations in 2011, achieving record revenues, improved profitability, and an increase in order intake, driven by progressive recovery of the civil sector. The division began to benefit from its innovation and efficiency drive while paving the way for further growth in international and services markets through the acquisition of Vector Aerospace.</p>
          <p>Overall, the net order intake increased compared to last year, led by renewed strength of the oil and gas markets. 457 helicopter orders were booked in 2011, worth &#x20AC;4.7 billion. Positive market momentum has continued into the current year, with 191 orders and commitments at the Heli Expo Air Show in Dallas early 2012. I think Louis had mentioned that already.</p>
          <p>Revenue and EBIT increases compared to a year ago are due to a favorable mix from commercial deliveries and support activities, and better operational performance. Revenues also include &#x20AC;256 million from the first consolidation of Vector Aerospace. A net charge of &#x20AC;115 million was booked in 2011. This mainly relates to governmental programs as well as to SHAPE. The 2010 figure included a net charge of &#x20AC;120 million.</p>
          <p>In the context of its innovation strategy, R&amp;D expenses increased to &#x20AC;235 million. In 2011, Eurocopter achieved important new milestones in its innovation drive, initiating flight tests for an AS350 hybrid helicopter demonstrator, and with the X3 demonstrator.</p>
          <p>Now, let's go to Astrium on slide 15, the transformation program, AGILE, delivered first results, improving Astrium's overall competitiveness and supporting successes in the export markets. Landmark deals in the U.S. and in Asia were secured, with telecommunications satellite sales to U.S. DirecTV and Malaysian MEASAT operators. Astrium demonstrated again its excellent program execution, maintaining revenues at 2010 level despite a challenging institutional market and increased competition.</p>
          <p>The Ariane 5 completed five launch campaigns in 2011, bringing the number of consecutive successful launches to 46 now. 13 Astrium-built satellites were launched in 2011, therefore, the first two Galileo IOV satellites and the very high resolution Earth observation satellite Pleiades 1A, for which Astrium services will be the exclusive commercial distributor.</p>
          <p>Order momentum continued, though at a lower level than the exceptional previous two years. Significant progress towards future extension in the services sector was achieved through the acquisition of Vizada in December 2011.</p>
          <p>EBIT decreased slightly compared to last year. The strong performance in satellites and space transportation businesses was weighed down by lower activity in services, expenses related to Vizada acquisition, and a charge of &#x20AC;23 million booked for AGILE, the transformation program in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now to Cassidian on the next page, budget constraints in the domestic markets are clearly having an impact on Cassidian's business, with some delayed order intake, delayed financing, and higher R&amp;D. Nevertheless, Cassidian achieved a robust revenue performance while profitability was in line with expectations. The EBIT of &#x20AC;331 million reflects a solid margin in mature programs burdened by significant growth in self-funded R&amp;D, a restructuring provision of &#x20AC;38 million, and a net negative charge of &#x20AC;34 million on programs.</p>
          <p>Despite a more challenging environment, the order intake reached &#x20AC;4.2 billion, including a contract award from EMIRAJE Systems, a joint venture between Cassidian and C4 Advanced Solutions, for the first phase of the United Arab Emirates command and control system. The order book remained solid at &#x20AC;15.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Cassidian continues to progress in its development of UAS capabilities. The first EuroHawk Unmanned Aerial System, a joint program between Cassidian and Northrop Grumman, conducted its service flight to Germany, where the signal intelligence mission system for the country's air force was integrated and flight testing will be performed. UAS cooperation agreements were signed with Turkish Aerospace industries and Alenia and a further agreement was signed with Rheinmetall to pursue its UAS activities within a new entity.</p>
          <p>Now finally to the other businesses on slide 17, revenues were up here 6% compared to one year ago. EADS North America revenues increased thanks to a ramp-up in LUH and medium and light transport aircraft deliveries. At Sogerma, rate increases and higher cabin seat activity offset the transfer of some activities to Eurocopter following the Vector Aerospace acquisition. The 2011 EBIT for other businesses more than doubled compared to last year, including increases at ATR and Sogerma as well as a gain from the divestiture of Defense Security &amp; Systems Solutions, DS3 in EADS North America that was completed already in May.</p>
          <p>ATR achieved an exceptional order intake of 119 net orders. These firm orders represent over 80% of all regional aircraft orders in the range of 50 to 90 seats. The backlog stands at 224 aircrafts, representing three years of production. EADS North America reached the halfway mark of its planned 345 LUH helicopter deliveries, with perfect, on-time, and on-budget performance.</p>
          <p>Now Louis will lead you through our guidance and outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans Peter. In 2012, we expect to see another significant improvement in our profitability. Let me first take you through our guidance on page 19. On the basis of our 2012 guidance, the group expects the world economy and air traffic to grow in line with prevailing independent forecasts, and we assume an average dollar exchange rate of &#x20AC;1 for $1.35.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Airbus would deliver around 570 commercial aircraft. Gross orders should be above the number of deliveries. EADS 2012 revenues should continue to grow above 6%. Group EBIT before one-off should improve significantly thanks to volume increases at Airbus and Eurocopter, better pricing at Airbus, and A380 improvements. We expect the EBIT before one-off to be above &#x20AC; 2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>The EADS 2012 EPS before one-off should be above &#x20AC;1.65, based on the net income before one-off. Going forward, the reported EBIT and EPS performance of EADS will be dependent on the group's ability to execute on its complex programs such as A400M, A380, and A350 XWB, in line with the commitments made to customers.</p>
          <p>Based on this EBIT guidance, EADS should continue to generate a positive free cash flow after customer financing and before acquisitions. As it is a most volatile item, especially during uncertain macroeconomic times, EADS will give a more precise guidance later in the year.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders. In line with the progress we have made, the board of directors is proposing an increased dividend of &#x20AC;0.45 to the annual general meeting of shareholders. This is converging towards a payout ratio in line with sector and industry peers.</p>
          <p>From a board perspective and as the company is maturing, this policy shall be the orientation for the future. Coming from a rather difficult position five years ago, I believe that shareholders have reason to be pleased with the strong fundamentals of our company, the growth of the past years and the progress we have achieved in many areas.</p>
          <p>I believe our outlook remains very good in spite of the macroeconomic turbulence. All divisions contribute to the improvement steps shown on slide 21, with the main profitability increase coming from Airbus, as discussed before.</p>
          <p>We will continue to keep a close eye on risk and opportunities within our major program. The A350 XWB represents the biggest risk and therefore demands our utmost attention as we progress towards first flight and series production.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the primary concern that has been followed carefully is the global economic situation, the foreign debt crisis. Transformation plans underway at Astrium and Cassidian, after Eurocopter and Airbus, will help us to adapt to a changing environment and improve profitability in those divisions. This is especially important in the light of the ongoing discussions with the German government and defense program.</p>
          <p>We believe there are significant opportunities for us in defense and security areas, which over time can mitigate the impact of reductions in European defense budgets. Yet, they're a strong positive for our business. We have noted the healthy demand for new passenger aircraft, which has driven our backlog growth. It enabled us to plan for increased volumes and improved pricing in the coming years. We expect demand to remain robust.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And the first question comes from Rupi Vig of Morgan Stanley. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I've got two quick questions. It's Rupi Vig here from Morgan Stanley. One, perhaps for Hans Peter, just around the cash, obviously, the free cash flow came in very strong. I just want to check, there's an other line item of negative 4, 5, 7. What was within the item, please, Hans Peter? And then, perhaps, one for Louis around the dividend, clearly, it's a big dividend increase. I mean, you've said you want to bring the payout ratio more in line with your peer group. But is this also a message to the market that dividends will be, perhaps, a more preferable use of cash than potential M&amp;A? Or are we reading too much into that, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On free cash flow, where does it come from? It comes &#x2013; as we said before, obviously, from &#x20AC;500 million, roughly, from higher profit. We have an effect, a positive effect, in gross cash flow from operations which is coming from provisioning to some extent. And we have also a positive impact of &#x20AC;300 million coming from depreciation.</p>
          <p>So these are some of the, I would say, positive effects. Obviously, it was driven globally by the deliveries of Airbus. We had a few airplanes more. And all that, I think, explains the better-than-expected performance.</p>
          <p>There is one element I'm probably missing here. We had an assumption that we would have less inflow of PDPs coming from our governments and finally, it turned out that it was better than expected, which also contributed to the good performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Hans Peter, does that mean that perhaps you'll see that reverse in 2012? Or what's your view of the PDP then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That means that is to some extent true. We are conservative, particularly in the way we're looking at PDP inflows from the government customers, and it's always a last minute Q4 question, which is very difficult to plan. So it was working again like in most of the previous years in 2011. But with the current environment, we have some kind of prudent approach here. I think if we look into 2012 cash flow performance, which seems to be conservative from your point of view probably, we also have to look to the further ramp-up.</p>
          <p>So, there is &#x2013; and particularly ramp-up of A350. And so we'll see the first somewhat significant inventories on A350 in 2012. We have, I would say, provided for some sales financing. I would say at the level we've seen in the previous years probably, so nothing unusual.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think on the government businesses, it is a question of new business in the future, which means that new business usually gives you also pre-delivery payments up front and if your book-to-bill is below one, you are living probably from the stock of pre-delivery payments on existing contracts. So, that is also an effect we probably will see in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add on the dividend and cash, Rupi, I'm sure you have taken notice that we &#x2013; our dividend is doubled compared to last year, which is significant. And taking into account the best result and our &#x2013; the orientation of the board to converge with industry and peers, and I think we, in the future, the board wants to be consistent with such a policy.</p>
          <p>On the use of cash, for the time being, we have now project to return our cash to our shareholders. You know that we have to look at the best use of cash. First, this cash is here to protect the company. You know that this cash is based mainly on PDPs, and we have to take that into account also. It means that we are cautious, and I could say that we were right to be cautious through financial turbulences.</p>
          <p>The cash &#x2013; our cash has protected the company. We'll continue this policy in the future, but it's also opening capacity and room for maneuver for acquisitions and for organic growth. We have shown that in 2011 in, I think, in a reasonable way. We will continue that and my successor will have his own ideas on the topic.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Joe Campbell of Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Louis, Hans Peter, Nathalie, if you're listening, and welcome Philippe. Before I ask my question, I just &#x2013; on your last full year of results, I want to congratulate you on all these achievements that are in the results and the fruits of all your hard work that are suggested in the guidance. And on behalf of all of us at my firm &#x2013; and I'm sure I speak for the others &#x2013; we want to thank you all for how nice you've been to the investment community over the years. We really appreciate it.</p>
          <p>I have an easy question. I presume it's probably for Hans Peter. I read this morning a commentary about German shares headed for the KfW and I wondered two things, whether you thought the additional government, rather than DaimlerChrysler, ownership could affect the ability of the North American team to implement its strategies with the DoD as government influence goes up.</p>
          <p>And two, what we're thinking for plans, given that the German government has said that this should be temporary, about how one might go about as Daimler sort of loses its responsibility for these shares, ensuring that as the government says, the KfW ownership is temporary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll try to answer your question. If you say easy questions, Joe, I'm getting suspicious. First, then -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there's no number, Hans Peter. So you can make it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> First not a list there (43:01). So, that's right. Second, thank you for the appreciation of our hard work.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, coming to your questions on how KfW will impact government, to be very honest, for the time being, it's not totally clear. We hope that the governance which was built over the last years will continue like this. I think it was very successful and leaving the management without strong influence from governments has paid off for the company and for its shareholders. So that's what I would wish I would say, but since the terms and conditions under which KfW will take the Daimler shares are not finally fixed yet, I think it's a bit premature to speculate about it.</p>
          <p>On North America team strategy, I don't think I see any change, any influence. So we have the support of the board in the past. I don't see that this will change. You have seen last year we had the first year of somewhat significant number on acquisitions and I don't think particularly also for North America -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- that there will be any change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I was worried that the DoD would see the addition of German government to go with French government and a little bit of Spanish -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-- as clearly making the German government influence, which is &#x2013; I mean, I know they don't exercise it, but from the DoD point of view, EADS is looking more government-controlled and less like it has important industrial influences to offset German and French governments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we have had that in the past already, not with Germany as you know. And we have not seen retaliation here, and I don't expect that honestly. On the plans and the question in how far this investment will be temporary, that is indeed what the budget committee has decided when giving an indemnification to KfW for buying the shares. So this is some kind of &#x2013; I wouldn't call it an obligation, but some kind of target, I think, for the German government. We are making our proposals, Louis and myself. We are &#x2013; as you know, we are working on this already since some time. We made our proposals to the core shareholders including the German government.</p>
          <p>It will be &#x2013; from my personal judgment of today, it will be somewhat a bit time consuming, so you shouldn't expect anything happening soon. But in my talks in Berlin at least, they have confirmed that this is their strategy, to keep it temporary. But we have to follow up on this one, obviously, so we need to make some pressure.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I add a word on that topic of political interference. Part of the answer to your question is partly it isn't in our hands. The capacity of the management of the company, the board of the company, to resist to inappropriate interference is demonstrated today. And I think it's the main answer we could give.</p>
          <p>Certainly, we need to have a dialogue with our domestic governments, as with any government and people &#x2013; the governments have not &#x2013; without any shareholding in the company are also discussing with us. That is quite normal. We are &#x2013; they are big customers. We are receiving support on research from them. We need to have a serene dialogue. What we can't accept is inappropriate interference which is not in accordance with the governance of a listed company.</p>
          <p>We have a free float of 50% of our capital. It will increase in the future, certainly increase in the future. And we have to behave as a listed company, and we have to make that clearly understood by the governments which have shares inside. And I am fully confident that my successor, Tom Enders, will stick to this policy. He has demonstrated in the past its own independence and is fully supported for that, as I was by the board.</p>
          <p>I could give you one element for that is the process of transition. It's exactly what the board wished to be. It's &#x2013; we had &#x2013; even if governments would wish to interfere, they have not done that, or have not been able to do that, because the board and the management were sticking clearly to the governance of the company, which means that decisions are taken by the board. And you have seen that in this transition process, there is absolutely no surprise. It's exactly what people were expecting. It's exactly what the company wished.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have, well, two questions. And the first one is, on your operational improvement at Airbus, just trying to understand how that's divided between progress on the A380 versus progress on the 320 and an A330. If you could give us a sense of what's been driving that improvement.</p>
          <p>And then second, when you talk about the A330 in the outlook, and you refer to the emissions trading scheme, I think of this airplane as right now having huge regional demand in Asia and I'm curious why you're focused on the emissions trading scheme to raise the rate from 10 to 11. And then also, if you're &#x2013; how you're thinking about it, potential improvements to that airplane over time and I'd tie that also back to how you're looking at demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you a sense, I think of the improvements coming from Airbus, globally, we have from volume and pricing and &#x2013; you refer to 2010 to 2011, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I'm really &#x2013; and also with Q4 and just how much is coming from the A380 on the operations side? I understand there's pricing and so forth, but you referred to operational improvement as a source of, I think, cost reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but I mean that's what it is. It's the volume, the mix, the pricing mainly, and that's it, basically. So you are discussing some &#x20AC;500 million, or more than &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;550 million probably coming from this for the full year. We had a pretty significant part of that in indeed in the last quarter, so there was some improvement in the last quarter given the good, very good delivery performance we had. Then you have the negative, as you know, the hedging and the R&amp;D with roughly around &#x20AC;200 each for the full year.</p>
          <p>And again, I think, if I'm not wrong in my memory, the impact which was coming from the hedging in the last quarter was literally zero in terms of comparison to the previous year. So you have seen &#x2013; or we have also seen a very positive hedging impact. So and if we again refer to the last quarter, we made a significant step, more than on average, on pricing also in the last quarter. So, this explains the good performance also of Q4. So I hope that helps you a little bit, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then on the A330?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the &#x2013; your second question on A330 and ETS, it's extremely simple. For the time being, the Chinese government is putting on hold approval of airlines orders concerning 35 A330 and 10 A380. It means these 35 A330 are split between six for 2013 and 19 for 2014. The contracts are completed and we are just waiting for the approval of the Chinese government, which is put on hold.</p>
          <p>It's a significant share of our backlog and our deliveries for the 2013 and 2014 years. It means that it's impacting the decision we have taken to increase the production rate from 10 to 11 airplanes beginning in 2014.</p>
          <p>I have to say more globally that we are worried to see that this conflict on the tax &#x2013; on the environmental tax is becoming a commercial war with the risk for Airbus to be taken as a hostage. And we are calling very clearly on the European Union to find a worldwide solution, because you know that European Union is absolutely isolated. All countries outside Europe are against the scheme. This scheme is creating distortion. It's not good for airlines, and it's certainly not good for us. We have to &#x2013; we are pleading for a worldwide agreement inside the ICARUS frame. It is the only way to avoid something which is becoming, as I said, a commercial war.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there any linkage, when you think about the rate increase and decisions around that, to potential improvements you might make to the airplane?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The potential improvement of the airplanes, you know that Airbus is always looking at the possible improvement on its airplane. The A330 is an airplane which has a future and we want to keep it at the cutting-edge of technology and performance. It's for that certainly Airbus is encouraged to look at possible improvement with good business case, certainly.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes is from Carl Walton Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi there. Actually, it's Celine Fornaro from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, two questions, if I may, the first one would be, Hans Peter, thinking about on the back of the strong Airbus performance this year in 2011 and looking at 2012 and 2013. I think Louis or you said that pricing will continue to be a strong driver. So, if you could comment on that, if that is one of the biggest driver with the A380 basically in the Airbus profitability recovery? And my second question would be on A350, just if you could give us a bit more detail on how things are progressing in terms of entering to the FAL, how was the iron bird testing going, how is the system installation going, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, Celine, indeed, you mentioned the elements which will drive 2011 into 2012 performance. So, the improvement, which is more than 700 million, as you have seen from the release, it is coming mainly &#x2013; I mean there are some ups and downs in the other elements, but it's mainly coming from the three elements, volume, price, A380. And I would say, it's not quite 100% so, but it's roughly evenly distributed, so this is driving the performance for next year.</p>
          <p>And then, I think that's basically explaining most of it. There is some insignificant, or less significant, impact coming from hedging. We have certainly something less. So, hedging is positive, in other words. We have less positive, or we expect positive impacts coming in the headquarters, because we had some kind of exceptional year, as you have seen. So, these are, I think, the main element of the reconciliation, but the three big elements you mentioned is indeed driving the big improvements there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you are talking at the Airbus level, yeah, on the volume price on A380?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And in terms of pricing, I mean looking a bit beyond, I mean, the pricing of the deliveries that we have ahead of us over the next, the mid-term, we do have an improvement in there, in pricing, going forward, basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have. The incremental steps every year are not huge, but it's not bad.</p>

For the assembly line, we'll begin the final assembly of the first static airplane in April and the final assembly of the first flying airplane, what we call MSN1 during summer. We are in the time schedule we have announced in November. Certainly it's tightening as we are progressing. It's a &#x2013; we have challenges ahead of us, and it's a program we have to follow extremely carefully, because we know that we are on new technologies and we are not &#x2013; even this program management is more than significantly improved compared to the A380.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Thank you. A couple of questions, the first of which &#x2013; sorry to ask one more in the A350 &#x2013; but just picking up on your last answer, we're basically three to four weeks away from the start of April. What is your level of confidence that you will hit that milestone, and what is the risk if you miss that milestone in terms of provisions, the program buffer, where it leaves you with regards to the first flight and the first delivery time schedules? That's the first question. The second one was just on R&amp;D outlook, if you're able to help us and step through the R&amp;D expectations for Airbus and for the group overall, both in terms of cash spend and in terms of the expensed versus capitalized for 2012 and ideally 2013 as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to not to give you all the elements you are requesting for the A350. I could say we have three categories of buffers when we are announcing a time schedule. The first one is a buffer on the design process. The second one is a buffer we have on the flying test process, certification process.</p>
          <p>And the third one is the difference between our industrial time schedule and the commercial time schedule. It means the number of airplane we have effectively to deliver to airlines. And in every of these different processes, we have buffers. And we are progressively eating these buffers, because at the end of the day when we deliver our airplanes, we have no longer a buffer.</p>
          <p>And we are very carefully looking at the way we are eating progressively these buffers. When we see that we are eating them too quickly, we are launching mitigation actions, and we try to preserve in any case buffers in the other processes which are not yet impacted. It's the only thing I could say to you. I can't go further. I can only confirm that we are that we are for the time being, clearly we are in the time schedule we have announced in November.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On your question on R&amp;D, Ben, going forward, we have reached now &#x20AC;3.1 billion, &#x20AC;3.2 billion in 2010, thereof &#x20AC;2.5 billion in Airbus. So going into the next years globally, the number will not change a lot. While Airbus probably has a slight decrease of the expensed R&amp;D, The other divisions have a small increase. So globally then, R&amp;D number is around this order of magnitude until 2014. And then we see the first, I would say, significant step downwards and coming obviously from Airbus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And at Airbus, the capitalized R&amp;D, is that stil expected to go up quite materially in 2012? You talked about the expense going down slightly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes up in 2012. Absolutely, we are &#x2013; globally for the group, we have bid more than &#x20AC;100 million capitalized in 2011 and we should be at more than &#x20AC;500 million in 2012. So there is a big step up on the capitalized R&amp;D side.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. A couple of quick questions, please. Firstly, I wondered if you'd quantify the provision that you took on A380 wing cracks this year and comment on whether it would potentially delay returning that program to breakeven by 2015. Secondly, well two sort of quite boring questions actually, but secondly, HQ reported &#x20AC;150 million profit this year versus a loss of &#x20AC;50 million last year, so quite a big swing. I wondered if there's a one-off in there. And also finally on the guidance, your guidance for EBIT implies quite big upgrades versus consensus, whereas your EPS guidance is currently below where consensus sits at the moment. So I wondered if there's a change in the tax charge or expected higher net interest. What's driving that please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the, perhaps the first question on the A380, inside the account of Airbus and it's not considered as a one-off because we are in the program which is ongoing. We have taken &#x20AC;105 million of provision to repair the 71 &#x2013; I said, 67 in my press conference, but actually it's 71, because we have delivered four airplanes since the beginning of the year. 71 airplanes, we are repair &#x2013; we have to repair, flying airplanes we have to repair.</p>
          <p>The first repair of the first 17 airplanes have confirmed that our provision was at the right level. But now we have also to find the permanent industrial solution to the problem we have indentified. We know that the root cause of the problem linked to stress and perhaps to also the quality of the material of the brackets. And now we have to find the manufacturing process, and we will have a clear evaluation of the potential cost overrun when we know exactly this manufacturing process. But it's clear that the target of our engineering, or design office, is not to trigger any cost overrun. We will see if they are able to achieve this target.</p>
          <p>This is not changing our view to &#x2013; we are targeting breakeven in 2015, linked perhaps, to the euro dollar exchange rate, but we are still targeting a 2015 breakeven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on your other questions, Jeremy, it is on headquarter. We had, I would say, some kind of exceptional year last year certainly. Part of it is we treated as exceptional. It was between &#x20AC;40 million and &#x20AC;50 million, which was a receivable we recovered which was written off years ago. But for the rest, it was not treated as exceptional and it comes from very good results, better than expected results from some of our participations.</p>
          <p>So it includes that so, but not only we have real estate subsidiaries. We have insurance subsidiaries and others. It comes from a re-allocation of the management fees in the last quarter, which will be recurring in the next years. It is around &#x20AC;60 million. So that will, in the future, increase or improve the headquarter and elimination result line.</p>
          <p>And finally, coming to eliminations, we had very low or even positive eliminations in 2011 compared to normally a negative eliminations in previous years. So this is normally a negative, which is difficult, obviously, to plan. So in other words, there are some elements with good performance which are probably not recurring, but not treated as a one-off.</p>
          <p>If you look into the history of headquarter elimination performance, it's between minus 20 and something like plus 50, so there is some volatility. And we have the &#x20AC;60 million fee, which should be a recurring element in the future, so it's something I would say between zero and 100 usually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think there was a last one, which was on net income, yes, there are. There is indeed one assumption which is more conservative than what we've seen in 2011, which is tax, which is a bit more than 4% I would say higher tax rate which is assumed in our plan.</p>
          <p>And then, certainly, the interest rate assumptions, which is a recurring element in this context as well, is probably conservative. So, that explains a little bit that there is a mismatch between EBIT before one-off and net income before one-off reconciliation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a word. Nathalie is insisting on me to be more precise on provisions on the A380. It's clear that the portion we are taking are concerning only the flying airplanes. It means airplanes delivered. It doesn't mean that we have not cost-associated to the other airplanes, either in the manufacturing process, in the assembling process, or for the future airplanes. But these costs have not been, for the time being, evaluated.</p>

Can you give us a view on what we should be expecting on that block for 2012 versus 2011 versus the &#x20AC;1.3 billion that you've done basically in 2011? What are the big drivers that we should look at? And my second question is the view that we can have on the French Defense spending, the consequences that could arise from a change in government in the coming months, how you think of that, how it is planned in the company?</p>

          <p>Yes. French Defense spending, I don't know what will be the new government and what kind of decision it could take. I am afraid that it will not be on the spending side. And we will have to see exactly what is happening with the defense budget. They have absolutely no view on that topic. For the time being, I could say that France is preserving most of its equipment program and making savings more on the operations, as we say, functional. It means -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The second question was on Eurofighther India, I think, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:13)? First one is on tax. It is &#x2013; it should not be recurring. We had some reassessment of tax provisions, if you like, so releases to put it in simpler words, which is obviously following tax audits, et cetera. So that is not something you should expect for the future. So it's still that we are around 30% or close to 30% on the tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Eurofighter in India is, certainly, we could have preferred to win. For the time being, that's what we're showing. It's an exclusive negotiation with Indian government. We are following that, but we are not active, because we have nothing to do. If &#x2013; we don't know what will be the outcome of this negotiation. We will see it. If there is a possibility to come back, we will use these possibilities, that's clear. But it depends on the Indian government and the way the negotiation of &#x2013; with Dassault is going.</p>
          <p>There is a &#x2013; as for every commercial campaign, there is a cost, but this cost is fully embedded in the 2011 accounts. And we are paying for that, but we &#x2013; so, that's clear. I &#x2013; on the financial point of view, we have to take into account that we have 46% of Dassault Aviation we are showing exactly the same percentage as our share in the Eurofighter. It means that through Dassault Aviation, we have some compensations.</p>
          <p>And I could say also that for our common subsidiary with Finmeccanica and BAE MBDA, it's clear that it's a good business, because all equipment of the &#x2013; all weapons of the <mark type="ph" /> RFAL (1:16:17) are coming from MBDA. It means that it's not a consolation for my team, but it's at least financially mitigating the impact of the loss of this campaign.</p>

Just going back to Hans Peter's comment on a flat outcome from the non-Airbus businesses in 2012 &#x2013; but you had about &#x20AC;200 million of one-off charges in 2011. So, those should drop out and you should have some positive impetus. So, A, what's offsetting that, or, B, are there going through some further one-offs charges in 2012. Second question, different one, what's the level of launch aid or, I think, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:17:20) in the balance sheet following the early termination of A340?

          <p>Yes, so on &#x2013; I mean, how it works, I think we explained that before. So it's literally we are not repaying the remaining principal and the remaining accrued interest, and we disclosed the numbers. And on 350, whether or not we continue to receive money is I mean, a question we have to follow up with the German government now. And, yeah, it's not decided as of today.</p>

          <p>And the next question is from Antoine Boivin-Champeaux of Cheuvreux.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, all. Antoine Boivin-Champeaux from Cheuvreux. First, I'd like to join congratulating you and your teams for this tremendous turnaround for this past five years. And I have two questions. First one is on the ramp-up situation. You decided to ramp up the A330, but not the A320 above the 42 per month. Why such a decision? My second question is on your 2015 target or objective that you gave us in the past of 10% EBIT margin, excluding the A350 initial losses. So, why have you not repeated this former target or objective? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a word on the A320, we are still &#x2013; Airbus is still studying the possibility to go from 42 to 44 per month. But you could imagine that it's putting our supply chain in intense tension and for that, we have to be careful.</p>
          <p>For the A330, we think that the supply chain is able. Because it's not exactly the same, it's able to go from 10 to 11. The constraint we have now is certainly the easiest question and the decision of the Chinese authorities to put a hold on the final approval of the orders made by airlines.</p>
          <p>On the 10% EBIT margin, we have not repeated, but this is still the same as in the past. You have been perfectly correct saying that this 10% EBIT margin is excluding the A350, because the A350 &#x2013; and it's at euro of $1.3, but it's still the aspirational target, as Hans Peter is saying.</p>
          <p>It's the ambitious objective, as I am saying. It means that it's not a guidance. It's an objective, which is corresponding to the 150% of the target setting for every member of the executive committee, but it's not 100%. It's 150% target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from David Perry of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, gentlemen. Sorry, it's a long call &#x2013; I know I've got three questions and all a bit detailed, I'm afraid. First of all, Hans Peter, on page 26, I guess I should say thank you, because I think you've finally given us the EPS pre-one-offs and everything definition that some of us have been asking for, which is this 1.39, which I don't think you've ever given us before. Very, very hard to try and reconcile to that. I think I can get there. It would be great if the IR could circulate a full reconciliation of that with a tax assumed on all exceptionals. But anyhow, that is by way of background, so your new guidance of 165 &#x2013; and I know that the question's been asked before &#x2013; but it just looks almost impossible to get to that number.</p>
          <p>Because the whole point of the 1.39 is it really is pre-volatile items, no program problems. You're taking them mark-to-market out of the interest. You're giving us the tax guidance of 30%. So, I just don't understand the 1.65, unless you're making some incredibly prudent interest rate assumptions, which you've &#x2013; or interest charges assumptions which you've alluded to, but I'm not sure why you're making those assumptions. So, the first question is, if you could just elaborate on that.</p>
          <p>The second question is you said there will be exceptional in three divisions, non-Airbus divisions, space, helicopters and defense. Your guidance of EBITA is pre one-offs, so could you tells us what those one-offs would be in those three divisions? And then lastly, given the strong prepayments that you've had in 2011, could you tell us what the excess pre-payments are that are sitting on your balance sheet? Are those pre-payments you haven't yet utilized? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the last question. If you talk about the, I would say, excess of pre-payment over inventories and capital, I would say, employed directly to be allocated against those, we are discussing a number which is around 9 billion, if my recollection is correct. So it's quite significant.</p>
          <p>On exceptionals, one-offs of the other divisions, I mean, I'll not give you today all the details. We have included something for next year. The restructuring programs are ongoing, and as we go through the year, we will give you more detailed updates on that.</p>
          <p>And on the EPS, yes, it looks, as we discussed already before, it looks low and I would confirm what you said. It's prudent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're saying above.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we say above indeed, Louis. And so far, I think I don't have to add a lot more of what I said already, David, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It just seems like you could have a 10%, 15% EPS swing based purely on your finance guidance. I'm just sort of confused why the &#x2013; let me put the question another way. Why is the finance line so unpredictable, given it now excludes mark-to-market items, which I think is great progress in the way you're presenting it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's because of the reasons you mentioned. We are prudent people. So yes, there is an upside, as you say. That's why we say above and that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you for everything and thank you for giving us the clean EPS definition. Good luck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question. I think we have time for two more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Zafar Khan of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. These are a couple of questions for Hans Peter. I'm completely confused about the tax rate going forward, Hans Peter. I think in answer to Jeremy's question, you suggested that the 2012 rate might be 400 or 500 bps higher than the 30% assumption. And then I think in answer to Nick's question, you were talking about a 30% rate going forward. So is it just one-off increase in 2012 and then it goes back to 30% as a kind of a planning rate or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. I mean we had 26% or close to 26%. It's even a bit below in 2011 because of the effects being mentioned before, and we'll plan around the 30% for 2012. Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that the rate we should be using going forward in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think you should use something which is 30% or close to 30%, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then on the capitalized R&amp;D &#x2013; apologies to all the other listeners who know about these things, but I'm struggling with this a little bit. You capitalized &#x20AC;100 million in 2011, and you're suggesting that the charged R&amp;D will be similar in 2012 to what you charged in 2011, i.e. around about &#x20AC;3.1 billion. Does this mean the extra &#x20AC;400 million capitalization you're talking about is the actual increase in the R&amp;D burden, but we don't see it because it's capitalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That is exactly what it means. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean &#x20AC;400 million increase, that's a big number. Is this employee number? Where is this coming from? How do you get that huge increase year on year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not only our employees. We are, to some extent, funding some at least of our suppliers. A lot of them are funding the things themselves. So, yes it is indeed the additional R&amp;D globally, if you add the expense and the capitalized R&amp;D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some sort of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, not everything is coming from Airbus. I should say that, because we have capitalized &#x2013; we intend to capitalize something in other divisions as well, for, example, in Cassidian if we come to some form of U.S. agreement, for example. So it's not only Airbus, but obviously predominantly Airbus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally on the aircraft financing side, you suggested that in 2011, the leasing companies kind of stepped up and provided 40% of the sort of financing requirement. On the 2012 570 aircraft that you're hoping to sell, are those fully funded all of those aircraft? As we sit here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as we can look through 2012, yes. They are funded. On the leasing company side, you have to understand that part of it is coming from the leasing companies' backlog. And another part of it is coming because of, I would say, sale and leaseback transactions done by airlines when deliveries are taken. But globally, for the time being, yes, we have no, I would say, significant exceptional difficulties in &#x2013; or we don't see them in funding the aircraft equipment in 2012. At least, as far as we can look today, yes, we can say it's funded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just wanted finally, if I may, to add to David's question, concern about the EPS reconciliation with the guidance on the EBIT that you've given. And I know you've said it's above 1.65 now. Above is, in my simple English, is a very open sort of word. And we can't let you get away with just saying, "Well, it's above and therefore that's it." I think to help yourselves and to help everybody else, you do need to maybe circulate later on some broad numbers. I'm not asking for forecasts, but some broad numbers as to how we go from that above 2.5 billion to 1.65.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a fair proposition, Zafar. Let's think about that, but I'm not sure we are going to do it, but at least we can think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, given your openness and how helpful you chaps generally are, this is a retrograde step, if you're just going to leave this at 1.65 and not develop that further. So, it's a plea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Taken. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're going to take our last, one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question is from Christophe Menard of Kepler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to you. A question on cost phasing, we had cost phasing in last year in 2011 in the different quarters. Do you see kind of the similar pattern happening in 2012 as well, and here I'm really talking about quarterly numbers, upcoming quarterly numbers? And the second question is do you see demand for further supplier purchase or M&amp;A? You mentioned that trend in December or at your Investor Day. Do you see your suppliers needing to be acquired, so to say, or some of them, and do you see this increasing in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on cost savings, we have not given any numbers. Our big programs are coming to an end this year, anyway. But we continue with continuous measures in all the divisions in the next years with the target that at least the cost savings have to cover the inflation. So, that is more or less the assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies. I was actually asking about the phasing of the cost that you &#x2013; we -</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>No, it's the phasing, yeah. Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have an answer to that, I think. Can you repeat it then? I'm not sure I remember.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's actually &#x2013; you remember in Q1 last year, you had a positive cost phasing, and I think it was a -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Now I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was wondering whether the same trend or pattern could happen in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's difficult to plan, Chris. This is indeed something which is developing throughout the year. You'll see that &#x2013; I mean the phasing effect finally was more or less reversed until the end of the year in 2011. And we cannot exclude that we were &#x2013; in between during the year, have similar phenomenon, hopefully not at a bigger level, but there is a certain probability that it might happen again. But I don't have a number for you. We are not so sophisticated in our planning, I have to admit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the suppliers, we don't like to buy our suppliers. It's not at all our policy. We want to &#x2013; it is exactly the opposite. We want our suppliers not too dependent on us. And you have seen that we have created a [iondiscernible] (01:33:53) in the [ph] primary outtake (01:33:54) as to give us the opportunity to get access to other customers and to be more independent from Airbus.</p>
          <p>We have been obliged to buy PFW in Germany this year, because this company will single source on our programs and in a very bad financial shape. But first, it's temporary and second, we don't consider that it's a good example for other suppliers. Our policy is certainly not to buy our suppliers.</p>
