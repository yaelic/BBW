          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. We will now begin Banco do Brasil's First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and a live broadcast with the slide presentation on the Banco's Investor Relations website, where questions may be sent through.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that this presentation may include references and statements, planned synergies, increasing estimates, projections of results and future strategy for Banco do Brasil, its associated and affiliated companies and subsidiaries. These expectations are highly dependent on market conditions, on Brazil's economic and banking system performances, as well as an international market one. Banco do Brasil is not responsible for bringing up to date any estimates in this presentation.</p>
          <p>First, we are going to have some details of the results. At the end of the presentation, the executives will answer the questions from the participants. With us today are Mr. Ivan de Souza Monteiro, CFO; and Mr. Gustavo Sousa, Head of IR.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gustavo, you may begin now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our first quarter 2012 earnings presentation. You will note <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:31) presentation that we made some changes in the format. We made it a little shorter and more objective and want to provide more time for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Starting on slide three, we have the highlights of our earnings. We reached R$1 trillion in total assets, a growth of 16% year-on-year. Our total portfolio in a broad concept that includes privately issued securities &#x2013; guarantees and retail portfolios that were brought after the association of the central bank Resolution 3533. The investment <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:09) reach R$473 billion, a 19% increase year-on-year. Our NII is growing within the guidance at 11.8%. Our delinquency rates are still the lowest in the banking industry and we saw a significant increase in fee, 23% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide four, we have the breakdown of our operating revenue in our various operating expenses. Our NII again growing at 11.8%, which is the most important item in Banco do Brasil's operating revenues, which comes to 60% of our operating revenues. The fee income, that's R$5 billion, grew 23%.</p>
          <p>And I'll also highlight the Previ item. This item is growing with our &#x2013; with the accrual component only. And this accrual component for this first semester is that R$130 million per month. And in our operating expenses, we see a growth in admin expenses running at 16.4%. We will break down this item over the next slide.</p>
          <p>And we also have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:26) growth and our recurring net income at R$2.7 billion. The extraordinary items related to those are the economic trends, with a gross effect of R$361 million, for a net effect after-taxes and the participation in profits <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:49) of R$201 million. The tax rate is at 26% and this is just a near effect of a higher tax shield arrived <mark type="ph" /> in some pieces (4:02) and on capital.</p>
          <p>On page five, we have the breakdown of sources and uses. That most important source item is still the deposits, which would stand for nearly three quarters of our total sources; this item grew 17.2% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I also highlighted the growth in commercial papers composed mostly by LCA, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:28) that is a credit, and LF, the improvement of bank loan. This item is growing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:35) and a specification <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:40).</p>
          <p>In terms of our uses, I highlight the growth in our loan portfolio <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:46) the 2682 resolution of the central bank resulting, at this point, to 70.8% of Banco do Brasil's total investments.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six, we highlight a record amount in our foreign borrowing; we reached US$37.3 billion and we think that fairly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (05:11) year-on-year and we highlight the bond issues above. Specifically, in January and February, we issued US$9.7 billion <mark type="indiscernible" /> (05:22) that counts as Tier 1 capital. The issues in January with a recap in February added close to R$52 billion in our Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide seven, we have a breakdown of our NII, and that highlights the gross and the revenue from loan operation, which expanded 16.9% year-on-year and our average share this February in our treasury results. It functions as Banco do Brasil's charges, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (05:57) bank's liquidity and also to manage the bank's exposure to federal market <mark type="indiscernible" /> (06:02).</p>
          <p>On the move by segment, I highlight stability instead from one operation. Moving to slide eight, we have a breakdown of our loan portfolio. This portfolio grew 19% over the last 12 months, reaching R$473 billion, with a growth of 18% in the agribusiness portfolio, 14.2% on individuals portfolio and 17.8% under corporates portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide nine, we have a breakdown of our portfolio, the credit portfolio with individuals, where we highlight the importance of the credit line that represents lower risk, such as payroll, foreign loan, auto finance and mortgages. These items correspond to 80% of Banco do Brasil's credit portfolio with individuals. And specifically payroll credit, which stands for nearly 40% of Banco do Brasil's individuals portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, we have the breakdown of our credit portfolio <mark type="ph" /> by (7:14) company in Brazil, where we showed an increase of 17.8% and I'll highlight the &#x2013; our most important credit line for this segment, which is the working capital, which accounts for 53.8% of the total portfolio of our company.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11, we have the breakdown of the portfolio with SMEs and with large corporations. The portfolio with SMEs grew by 24.3%, relying on the usage of the FGO, the Guaranteed Fund, the usage of the FGO through SME grew by 38.8% over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 12, in our Agribusiness portfolio <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:02) where Banco do Brasil is the absolute leader. We're 63.7% market share. We saw an increase of 18.4% in the portfolio and this is broken down into the following components. We saw a 15.9% growth in credit for small producers, 25.7% in credit for mid-sized and large producers and a 20% growth in credit for company. The Agribusiness credits for company midsize is around 67.3% of our fellow Agribusiness portfolio. It gets further where we had very large EBITDA today which is 0.6% 90 days that's in delinquency.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, we have a comparison of Banco do Brasil's credit portfolio by risk model that the concentration in the AA to C of Banco do Brasil is superior to the average in the industry.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, we have a breakdown of our NPL plus 90 days, when you compare Banco do Brasil's consolidated numbers in the blue line, we see an extend chain, but it's much better than the industry. And when you compare that with Banco do Brasil extreme operations in Banco Votorantim we see an improving trend.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 15 where we had a coverage ratio. The coverage ratio of Banco do Brasil's consolidated is on the yellow line and you can see that 210% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (09:53) average of our peers. And Banco do Brasil excluding the operation trend Banco Votorantim showed an increase in the coverage ratio finishing March 2012 at 245%.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we project our quarterly credit provision expenses for the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter, we know that analysts and investors that's following this very closely and we decided to give an objective number further as well as coming quarters as you can see on this slide.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 17, we have a breakdown of our administrative expenses. We have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:37) expenses. The salary increase has happened at the end of the second semester, so the comparison of the first quarter of 2012 with the first quarter of 2011 is unfair on that specific point. We have a decent quarter-on-quarter due to a vacation effect that we have in Brazil that the analysts and investors are very familiar with.</p>
          <p>On the other administrative expenses, we showed a growth of 15.9% or an overall growth of administrative expenses at 16.4%. The reason we have grown above our guidance in admin expenses is because of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:25). We started consolidating the operations from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:31) on the second half, so the comparison with the first quarter is not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:36). And we also have new expenses <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:42) and other outsourced services that were not contained in the first quarter of 2011. When you view the market over the last 12 months, we see that we were within the guidance. So based on that we projected for the fiscal year of 2012, we will be within the guidance for <mark type="ph" /> average (12:06) expenses.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 18, we have the breakdown of our fee income which grew 23% year-on-year. It is based on the growth of the most important item. If we look at the first four items in this slide, account fees, fees from debit and credit cards, fees from asset management and fees related to credit operations, most of the items grew above 20% or close to 20% and this the reflection of the Banco do Brasil's investment in new platform that we call <mark type="ph" /> BB2.4 (12:44) where we added 10,000 employees to the branch network and we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:51) IT so that we can provide a better level of service to our clients and extract more revenues out of the relationships.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we have our cost to income ratio. And this quarter we finished at 45.2% and recently we have an increase there. It's mainly because of a lower participation of Previ as we've discussed in the initial slides and the initial expenses of Banco Postal. Banco Postal directly contribute their improving revenues for Banco do Brasil but in the first quarter naturally the impact of the expenses is raised a little more.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 20, we have our BIS ratio of 14.3% as we've discussed. We had an increase of close to 52 basis points that come from the issuance of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:48) in January and February, and a Tier 1 capital of 10.9%.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 <mark type="ph" /> show a continuation of the (13:59) performance in the first quarter with the guidance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:06). We are within the guidance for ROE, NII, and total deposits. We are growing slower <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:16) domestic loan portfolios, we are growing at 14.2% in individuals and 17% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:21) company whereas these are achievable within the guidance for 2012 as a whole especially with the new program that you are very aware <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:40). In Agribusiness, we have given a better guidance mainly given the growth in credits to mid-size and large-size deal producers and the company's EBITDA on the previous slide.</p>
          <p>The allowance for loan losses are within the guidance, fee income growing above the guidance, admin expenses above the guidance but we will be within the guidance for 2012. That's our projection and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:58) given the factor I explained on the first slide. Thank you very much and let's now open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Yes. Go ahead please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. So a couple of questions. First on asset quality. If you look at the bank itself on Banco do Brasil, asset quality is actually improving at the bank for a lot of reasons, but overall, including Banco Votorantim, there's been a deterioration. You gave guidance through the end of the year for provision expenses. Those are below the guidance that you have, the overall guidance you have for the year. Could you give us some support or some data that can support your confidence that you'll be able to meet these provision expense guidance given what we hear from your peers in terms of the auto book particularly with respect to Banco Votorantim?</p>
          <p>And the second question is with respect to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:55) program. If you can give us some data from the program over the last month, how much do you have originated loans, what kind of profitability you expect from these loans, how will that affect the overall profitability of the bank, it would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The Banco do Brasil is a little different from the other <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:17) in the Brazilian market. As you know in our answer when you talk about lines like the agriculture, trade and finance, <mark type="ph" /> sales finance (17:27) and other kind of loans that even if there is a very good delinquency ratio <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:36). We're still comfortable to work with these kinds of portfolio. So we were different from the other banks out there. In my opinion, we have some difference that could explain the behavior of the delinquency inside Banco do Brasil and the behavior of the delinquency in the other banks.</p>
          <p>Talking about Banco Votorantim. We changed the methodology, credit methodology of Banco Votorantim and what was existing, it was because the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:05). The Brazilian Central Bank <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:10) in December 2010. These market potential measures create and change dramatically the dynamics of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:18) of finance, that's right. We've decided that the board of Votorantim to change the methodology, to change the approach to the market just to make sure that we can originate new loans with a very good delinquency ratios below the <mark type="ph" /> average open (18:38) market. It is doing well. We started this movement in September 2011 and we have now seven months with a very good delinquency ratio. Talking about 90 days capacity. That's why we keep up the measures that we put in place are working well in Banco Votorantim and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:59). The delinquency ratio in Banco Votorantim in a recent chart for the second semester is very, very to the station lower in comparison to first semester, very tough in the third quarter, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:14) will talk about the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:29), the domestic loan portfolio now is the average daily disbursements. It's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:36) to talk about impacts of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:39) in our revenues and margins and all that because we have less than one month of performance to date. So if you look at some of the credit lines on Banco do Brasil such as auto service, auto signing, and executive value.</p>
          <p>They're all growing more than 50% per month. On the distribution specifically, we're growing month-per-month, I'm sorry, just on metric of the average daily disbursements. <mark type="ph" /> In the different jobs (20:08) alone, we have grown advanced 51%. When you compare the average term <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:16), but some of the items such as the different jobs have a very small volume. We are now at the different geographies and it's daily value of R$1 million in new credit. So we have then more than one chance in a very small base. That's why it is too soon to talk about different factor of Banco do Brasil, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. If I could just go back at the first question. You said a substantial improvement in volume. The NPL ratio, the 90-day past due ratio for Banco Votorantim, the first quarter was on the retail book was 7.1%. Is the substantial going back to the first quarter of 2011 when it was 2.3% or is it the fourth quarter 2011 5.5%. Where do you think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:05), better than this. We are talking about below 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Below 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. 1.9% since September 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the end of the year, do you think the whole portfolio is going to go below 2% or are we just talking about &#x2013; are you going to have a slower migration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have 2% on the performance after <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:30) because we authorized the bank last month, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21;35) the bank to grow at the end of third quarter. It would be too soon to say that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:45) is growing, that's why we feel comfortable that with the level that we are getting to start to building nation in September, October, November, December, not only in 2012, we feel comfortable to start growing again at the interest ratio is below 2% it's 1.5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:07) very difficult to say it's a panel effort with commercial part of the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next should be Mr. Saul with JPMorgan would like to ask a question. Please, Mr. Saul. go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. I have a question and a follow-up. And just if I can make a request Gustavo and Ivan to speak very clearly next to the mic because we're having a difficult time hearing you guys clearly. So if you could speak very clearly closer to the mic it would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. We'll increase the volume here. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Two questions because I'm going to be very blunt with my first question because I think it is something that investors are generally worried about as you know. And the use of &#x2013; I think the government has been very clear about the use of public bank for lower lending spread. I've seen &#x2013; your tangible capital ratios are lower than some of your peers. And so &#x2013; and your guidance for loan growth for the year 17% to 21% obviously implies a pretty substantial pick up in terms of credit growth which could further diminish your regulatory capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Just as a government owned institution where the Federal government own 60% as company why should the minority shareholders be concerned that their interest are going to be sacrificed at the extensive policy range, and I have a follow-up question as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't feel any kind of concern related to minority shareholders. If you have led <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:48) you see that we've delivered what we promised. We delivered what we planned to do. We delivered what was inside our strategy. That's why we feel confident that what we are doing now, we provided guidance at the end of 2011, we are still in this process. What is changing is the dynamic structure in the Brazilian economy. That is built very, very well. We have a downward change and the benchmark there and that is good for monthly review because monthly review as you know is a very good practice for the economy in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We don't feel comfortable where there is a large productivity in our markets. We don't <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:32). We are making money by providing service. We are making money to develop our long-term operations and the relationship with our customers and we feel comfortable to work Brazilian banks. We know that we need to beat our new infrastructure in the country <mark type="ph" /> that's why you have your leader (24:51) in all margins related to the real economy in Brazil <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:57) we feel confident and familiar through this strength. That's why we don't feel any problems related or any concern in relation to the minority shareholders about our strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. I have a follow-up question on Carlos' question about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:18) as well. Can you just repeat &#x2013; I'm sorry I must not have heard very well. Can you repeat the guidance for delinquency rates in the second quarter? Did I hear it correctly when you said that you think your overall NPL ratio, 90-day NPL ratio at Banco Votorantim will improve substantially in the second quarter? Do you think it was 7.3% in the first quarter or are you talking about something else early stage delinquent fees or something with the like? I wasn't clear what exactly you were referring to when you said that the NPL ratio delinquencies will improve in 2Q versus 1Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Saul. It's Gustavo here. I'm sorry but we can't tell you and you would think that is right. And, yes, in cost it's 1% and pretty close to that. The close to 2% NPL that Ivan mentioned is related to the numerous advantages that were originated but basically factors the tender in 2011, okay? So for the overall portfolio, we said that it's hard to quantify because it will be a net effect of the growth in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:32) and we explained that the commercial area of Banco Votorantim received the instruction to resize the origination purpose. Normally neither the bank is confident nor the new credit methodology but nevertheless the NPL ratio is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:50). However on the new vehicles again, we were close to 2% NPL that's 90 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're not saying that the overall NPL ratio will go down in 2Q that that's not what the &#x2013; you're just saying that the you just have more &#x2013; have a lower NPL ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you got it. You're exactly right. It's hard to predict it so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, great. And then just one quick question on Votorantim, I think there's concerns about the capital ratio, 13% in light of the losses in the last two quarters. I know you said on the Portuguese call that the results should improve although how much we don't really know. Is there a risk that you're going to have to infuse them with capital and what will be the impact on your own capitalization ratio if you would &#x2013; if you would need to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there are some let's say moving pieces with the capital ratio of Banco Votorantim. So we don't have a clear projection on what's their ratio would be at the end of the second quarter. There are some treasury measures that we took that gave them some increase on the capital ratio. We also want to go with the performance we did to see what the end impact would be. And in terms of the impact of a possible capital allocation of Banco Votorantim at Banco do Brasil consolidated that impact is very small and I can go with the details with our accounting with you on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:32) or next week. But the impact of the capitalization there in Banco do Brasil, our capitalization is very small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you believe that a capital infusion will be &#x2013; is likely in the coming quarters or is it too uncertain at this point to make that prediction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you then turn to commercial performance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:53) on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Excuse me. <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Daniel (29:06) with Citi would like to ask a question. <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Daniel (29:08), please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:12) couple of questions. The first one is a follow up to the prior questions on capital. If I'm not mistaken, not so long ago, Ivan, you guys issued an official press release with an estimate of how the Basel III rules would impact the capital ratios of Banco do Brasil with the understanding you had at that moment of how the rules were applied, and the conclusion was that there was no scenario where you envisioned the need to issue equity before 2014 at the earliest &#x2013; and even 2014, Ivan you said, was questionable. But that was before the launching of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:50) programs to lend at lower rates as the government is pushing.</p>
          <p>So you may have revised upward your expectation for loan growth. I don't remember what was the assumption you used in that exercise that you did a few months ago to conclude that you would not need any capital to be compliant with Basel III until 2014 at the earliest, but it may have been lower than the current provision for loan growth, if I'm not mistaken, it was closer to 15%. You are now trending at loan growth closer to 20%. Have you revised that estimation, Ivan, and are you still feeling comfortable that it's highly unlikely that Banco do Brasil will need to issue equity to be compliant with Basel III, even the new expectation for loan growth? That would be question number one.</p>
          <p>And question number two, on Previ, as you explained well <mark type="ph" /> it's line number (30:40) before, that you have significant declines in the contribution from this line, to only R$390 million in this first quarter. What should we expect from this line going forward, if you have some indication or guidance to give us for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once again, we didn't change, what we said to the market, it was still early <mark type="ph" /> Brasil Votorantim (31:05). But I can't remember that, because we keep our guidance for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:15) I believe that the numbers that we provided will not change in the future. But again, I prefer to wait and <mark type="ph" /> kind of use on (31:23) the Brazilian Central Bank that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:26) rather than June &#x2013; May or June. These are another numbers related to our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:35) Tier 1 capital. But again, I have a feeling now that we did not &#x2013; we will not expect any change in the numbers that we provided before. Gustavo will talk a little bit about Previ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Previ, as you saw, we had R$390 million on the quarter, that's R$130 million per month. You can expect that for the second quarter as well. We revise this projection every six months. So for the third quarter, a new guidance in this number from us and what we are projecting is a clear effect only. It tends to be close to that, <mark type="ph" /> Daniel (32:21). But we will have a more accurate number at the end of the second quarter, we'll be able to give you an estimate of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but will come on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:34) only.</p>
          <p>If you look at the capitalization under the quarterly method, the quarterly's close to R$6 billion. The adjustment effect, not talking about the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:44) the adjustment effect, is under the quarter. We are close to R$2 billion there. So we are only expecting the impact of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:52).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to make sure I understand the two answers. On Previ, Gustavo what you are saying is that for second quarter it will be the same as first quarter, then you will revise the actuarial calculation as you normally do. And then you have more clarity on the next conference call about that. Is there any risk that, as a result of that actuarial calculation, just the accrual could be lower than the R$130 million per month in the second half of the year, or R$130 million per month is the floor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is based on the interest rate and the interest rate there is inflation measuring by the INPC, if I'm not mistaken, but I will present that to you and <mark type="audio gap" /> (33:40-33:44)...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Should be close to that, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the first answer, you're saying, Ivan, that you will &#x2013; you want to wait for the final rules on Basel III. But assuming that those rules are not different from what you assumed in your first exercise, you still feel comfortable with the conclusion that you won't need to issue equity before 2014 at the earliest. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:10). You can't be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:12) market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it seems that your expectation for asset growth are higher now, but it may have been value end, that's irrespective of the final rules of Basel III I was questioning, to what extent you may now need to revise that, just because your risk-weighted asset may grow faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, <mark type="ph" /> Daniel (34:30), but there's only one detail on that communication that we sent in the beginning of March. The growth in risk weighted assets was projected at 15.2% on average for the next two years, 2012 and 2013. This is the growth in risk weighted assets. It depends on what the rate factor is on the growth of the credit portfolio. Regarding to credit, as you know, it's between &#x2013; it's ranged between 17% and 21%.</p>
          <p>So the growth trend is 19%, right? So 19% credit, not &#x2013; I'm not talking about the risk weight and it depends again on the rate factor on this growth, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:13) mentioned, these numbers don't match directly. And in fact, we didn't change any assumption.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, Mr. Marcelo with Credit Suisse has a question. Please go ahead, Mr. Marcelo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello everyone, Marcelo Telles, Credit Suisse. I have some questions on Banco Votorantim. I'd like to dig a little bit deeper on the asset quality issue. You mentioned during the call that you expect a significant decline in provision expenses at Votorantim. And I'm kind of having a hard time reconciling your statement, I will turn to the numbers that I saw, if I look at Banco Votorantim's notes &#x2013; the financial statement. I say that because, if you look at the operations that are being classified from B to D, which are actually overdue, you have nearly &#x2013; Votorantim has nearly R$5 billion of loans that are actually overdue that are classified in the B to D categories for which there are only about 4% of those R$5 billion currently being provisioned, right, as per the requirement of these risk categories.</p>
          <p>So, how comfortable are you that at this &#x2013; as this loans that are already overdue, as they go down to the higher risk categories, that this will not lead to a material increase in provisions in the quarters to come? So basically expecting this overdue loans to become current again, or &#x2013; because it seems the bank might need much higher provisions going forward, based on the numbers that I see here in Votorantim's financial statement. So if you can reconcile that, I would appreciate.</p>
          <p>And my second question is, do you think that this year, we would see Banco do Brasil having to inject capital at Votorantim? And if so, do you think that the family would also be able to inject capital as well, to also participate in the capital increase? Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, this is <mark type="ph" /> Paulo (34:44) here. And regarding the credit provisions for Banco Votorantim, the projections that we had made at the end of last year for the first quarter and now the beginning of the first quarter, in terms of provision, they match <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:59), so we were expecting that high volume of provision expenses in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we're likely to see a small decrease in this level, whereas a more serious decrease on the third and then the fourth quarter, which you're talking about a high level of provisioning. They're relatively &#x2013; for the first quarter and the second quarter, it's significantly lower. So it's important that we qualify the <mark type="ph" /> weightage (38:27). We were already talking about high level of provision, now in the first quarter and in the second quarter, there really hasn't been any significant decrease, but it's still a large number. And again, our projections for first quarter and what we have in the second quarter are matching almost perfectly.</p>
          <p>Let me talk about a capital injection at Banco Votorantim. Banco Votorantim has the support from its <mark type="ph" /> true (38:56) shareholders <mark type="ph" /> and even its (38:59) possible scenario. We have the calculations for that and it is possible that this may happen. The actual impact on Banco do Brasil is very small, and I can't project to you right now <mark type="ph" /> even (39:10) what will happen. And I didn't catch the final comment on your question on Votorantim, about participation of the &#x2013; could you repeat that, Marcelo please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the second question should be, if the family &#x2013; in case there is the need for a capital increase opportunity &#x2013; a capital injection, if the family would be willing to participate in the capital injection? Because of course, if they don't and if you do it, you might end up with more than 50% is taken, you might be forced to actually consolidate Votorantim. So maybe I can ask that question a different way. Would be willing to go beyond your 50% stake at Votorantim if necessary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the scenario that we analyzed, and we have to &#x2013; we reaffirm the commitment from the chief shareholders in the scenario that <mark type="inaudible" /> (40:17) qualifying my first comments on the provision. It's hard to talk about subjective items, but, in the second half of this year, we're talking about a level of provision being compared to the level of <mark type="ph" /> new stream and the show cap (40:32) significantly lower, substantially lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you allow me to follow up on that point. I mean, that's exactly the point I'm having a hard time understanding because I look &#x2013; this is just public information in the Votorantim's numbers. I mean there is R$5 billion of overdue loans classified between B and D, where you have &#x2013; less than R$300 million are being provisioned right now. So my concern is that, if these loans do not become &#x2013; are not paid, or do not go back to the proper &#x2013; to the current category, that you might actually &#x2013; Votorantim might have actually to provision a meaningful amount in the quarters to come, and then your expectation of lower provision expense in the second half of the year would actually not materialize. And I'm just look at the &#x2013; this note D on Votorantim's notes, the financial statements. So if you can explain &#x2013; so basically expecting this not to be &#x2013; to continue overdue, you think that this will go back to the performing portfolio? So that's what I'm having a hard time understanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Marcelo. I suggest that &#x2013; I'll arrange that for you, that you will call the Investor Relations team at Banco do Brasil and then we'll work in detail into the financial statements and the possibility of migration to higher or lower risk, okay? So then we can look at AA to H level and see how we've been make projections and how we can <mark type="ph" /> fluctuate it further (42:18) your projection with ours, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Excuse me. Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:28) with Santander would like to ask a question. Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:31) please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I have a question regarding the calculation of capital ratios at Banco Votorantim, because if we look at the total credit risk, including these loans that were sold with recourse, they are larger than the risk weighted assets. So it appears that these are not included in the calculation of capital ratios. Can you explain this, and then I have a follow-up question after this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:58) something very specific related to Banco Votorantim <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:02) of the capital ratio fluctuation for Banco Votorantim but first, we look at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:15) but I will investigate your question, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up question has to do with a question that was also asked before about minority shareholders and strategy. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:31) is a train wreck. I think that it's pretty clear that if we think of what's happening in Peru or Spain <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:41) loans that we originated back in the second half of 2010 or 2011, the growth rates that Votorantim had in the column segment and throughout <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:54) admittedly to September 2011 reached out to the conclusion that the losses are going to continue throughout the year and most likely capital increase will begin.</p>
          <p>So my question is why &#x2013; what can you tell us regarding the risk that this type of results will not pollute the rest of the loan within Banco do Brasil given that we have the understanding that the growth in Banco Votorantim was partly influenced by the desire of the present environment to deactivate credits in the auto-loan segment et cetera, and even the measures of lower prices and stronger growth in loans, what really went wrong? Because, it was &#x2013; it is a train wreck and you probably have to increase capital and investors are rightfully fearing that this behavior could repeat itself in their larger franchise.</p>
          <p>And when we look at the &#x2013; and I have a question regarding the law of Banco do Brasil, because I remember that at some point in time there was a provisioning that the bank would not be used as a instrument of policy except for the agricultural sector and then there are <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:05). So what does the law say regarding this potential risk that someone could feel that the bank is being used as an instrument of policy and that you should be demanding equalization income and something other segments of the credit exposure? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel very comfortable about the methodology. The first methodology that we applied inside Banco do Brasil and we changed the methodology at Banco Votorantim while we are familiar with. Why? Because we feel comfortable that the methodology that we have inside Banco Brasil, there is a bank with some much larger numbers of produces and services and I'm not sure why this base of customers is there and could provide improvement in the methodology of Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>We wait for six months to led the commercial side of the bank against the starting <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:04) the debt portfolio. During these six months, it was &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:09) finance services can change from R$3 billion per month to R$8,000 million. Now we are able to see it again, why? Because we feel comfortable now with this right methodology. That's why don't be afraid about anything related to any kind of change on our internal <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:30) Banco Brasil as it related to pricing methodology and approach to the market.</p>
          <p>The markets that we feel comfortable to work is really the economic thing to do and as you know Brazil is in a very good moment. It is a country <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:46) we didn't see the growth and we feel comfortable that now to work with some part of our portfolio that we are now the leader. As I mentioned, that we are the leader in the payroll planning, but are now the leader with...</p>

          <p>...your allowance were really charged at those maximum rates. What I'm trying to get a sense, were they really material to profitability of the bank or could you give any estimate the reduction on the average rate charges as a result of this announcement or at least how much more than the average reduction of the <mark type="ph" /> selling (47:47) rate is being offered to clients? And if you believe that at the end of the day that it would be partially compensated with better asset quality and better guarantees on loans given that these lower rates are being offered for &#x2013; under this package <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:04) accounts, which in my view are safer <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:10).

          <p>Hi, <mark type="ph" /> Regina (48:18). Gustavo here. Regarding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:21) <mark type="ph" /> it's likely to break down your questions. So starting with older direct accounts where you saw the reduction. The reduction is one short line that offsetting the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:31) problem. As you know, older direct accounts, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:39) is not a priority for Banco do Brasil. We focus on payroll <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:44) also, you know, Banco do Brasil <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:47) to Banco do Brasil was not so good as older direct accounts <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:54) being a financial advisory with the clients <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:59) seek an adequate credit line such as payroll. So we certainly have older direct accounts. If this material <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:10) I don't have the percentage here applying the charge at the maximum rate, but what I actually have to look to give you a number is the percentage of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:20) point, there are charge at the maximum rate. I will get that for you.</p>
          <p>Regarding other items of Banco do Brasil being announced today, all of them are based on a multilateral or a new guarantee. You know banking service, we talk about banking service over the past week and there are different components of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:44) individual and for companies. But what was announced today was specifically an overdraft, as you saw, which again building our profit in on other items. You'll notice the credit base is down from new collaterals, such as real estate or your car. Okay? So yet we do not expect a worsening of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:10) which is a strategy to grow in lower rate segments. We are also not revising our guidance for credit growth for NII.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks. And my second question is regarding Banco Votorantim. In their release, Banco Votorantim, they made that comment that considering the change of Resolution 3533, the bank decided not to sell portfolios in the first quarter of 2012 and had a negative impact of R$50 million because of prepayments and provisions related to past credit assignments. And in the fourth quarter of 2011, there was a gain of over R$500 million related to credit assignments. I mean, this could mean that at least it has some &#x2013; can you consider that you had some improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter considering that in the fourth quarter Banco Votorantim had a positive impact of R$500 million related to credit assignments?</p>
          <p>And then do you expect the legacy from impact that we saw in the first quarter of R$57 million related to this previous credit assignments to continue in the future for a while or is there any chance of recovering <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:35) more credit assignments again, but this time without recourse? I mean, would the Banco do Brasil acquire portfolio from Banco Votorantim without recourse from now on in order to improve the capital ratio at Banco Votorantim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We could invest <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:51) if you look at this. And as you mentioned, Banco Votorantim didn't sell any &#x2013; didn't sell the portfolio during the first quarter and they did get a lot in the fourth quarter of 2011. And as you mentioned, it could be again <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:15) for the Banco Votorantim and for Banco do Brasil <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:19) these methodologies and that you don't have the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:26) to deposit to the bank <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:31).</p>

          <p>Excuse me. <mark type="ph" /> Eduardo (52:41) has a question. <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Eduardo (52:43), please go ahead with your question.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The first question is regarding the new savings account rules, the new remuneration that was released this morning. I would like to know what do you expect the impact for Banco do Brasil and for the industry as a whole? You as one of the largest saving deposit banks in Brazil, how do you see that impacting especially your agribusiness on loan portfolio? Do you expect also that going forward, all mortgage loans and agribusiness loans will be linked to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:31) if interest rates go below 8.5%? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Gustavo here. I'm sorry <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:44). It's still too soon to talk about any of that, okay? You're estimating or the impact at this point, it turns out asset liability management. Our first announcement shows that the impact is not relevant, but other impact such as in other portfolios as you mentioned, we still have no deal in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. My second question is regarding the household commitment, income commitment. We are reaching almost 25% as one part of the income of families are being committed with payment of loan, right? I know that interest rates are coming &#x2013; are lowering and that will be good for the system probably also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:42) but are you worried about the current leverage of the families today in Brazil? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not worried. We believe that we can follow this closely. We follow this very closely. Our credit department has specific studies on this. This calculation depends and where would be the calculation are. Calculation would have a better commitment at 21%. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:11) your interest <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:13), the turn of interest rate reduction will <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:21). The possible duration extension <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:26) most sensitive item, it increase duration rate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:31) so specifically mortgage credit growth in the country depends to because of the duration of extension, this tends to be less of a problem. So we follow this very closely <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:44) and other items are very low risk. So this gives us the possibility of not being impacted by excessive investments in the family.</p>
