          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2007 MasterCard Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Catena, and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Catena. And good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us, either by phone or by webcast, for a discussion about our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial Results. With me on the call this morning are Bob Selander, President and Chief Executive Officer; Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tara Maguire, our Corporate Controller.</p>
          <p>Following some comments by Bob and Martina, highlighting key points about the fourth quarter and the full year, we will open up the call for your questions. In total, the call will last up to one hour.</p>
          <p>This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. The earnings release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week until February the 7th.</p>
          <p>Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob Selander. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Barbara and good morning everyone. We are thrilled with our strong financial performance in both the fourth quarter and full year. These results demonstrate our success in leveraging our assets and global business model to differentiate MasterCard in the marketplace. Our diverse offerings and payments insights are clearly resonating with our customer financial institutions and merchants who continue to appreciate the value we provide to their businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 2 of the slide deck. In the fourth quarter, we delivered net income of $304 million or $2.26 per share on a diluted basis. This includes after-tax gains of $185 million or $1.37 per share from additional sales of our investments in Redecard. We once again recorded quarterly net revenue of over $1 billion, up nearly 28% from the fourth quarter of 2006. This was driven by strong growth in gross dollar volume and process transactions, including cross-border volumes, which grew by over 27%. Additionally, pricing adjustments contributed approximately 2% of the revenue growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, we saw our operating margin improve 10.3 percentage points, 16% from 5.7% excluding special items demonstrating the continued leverage ability of our business model.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you are wondering how the economy will affect our ability to maintain these strong results. So let me spend a moment on slide 3 to make a few observations about the current economic situation in the United States and what it means for MasterCard.</p>
          <p>Although we've not seen the same impact on our business that the slowdown in the U.S. economy has had on other financial services companies, continued weakness has the potential to slow the rate of our U.S. growth in the future. However, there are four distinct factors about our business that put us in a better position in times of economic uncertainty in the United States.</p>
          <p>First, a significant portion of our business is transaction driven. We can't predict the future of the U.S. economy but regardless of what happens, we expect that consumers will continue to transact. While consumer spend might be slowing relative to what we've seen in the past, MasterCard U.S. data from the 2001 recession indicates that transactions grew at a rate that exceeded volume growth.</p>
          <p>Additionally, MasterCard Advisors spending pulse data, which captures more than card-based payments indicates that a mix shift in consumer spending is occurring. Over the past several months, consumers have moved away from discretionary items such as jewelry, full service restaurants and home furnishings towards everyday purchases including gasoline, grocery and personal healthcare items. This movement to everyday purchases aligns well with where MasterCard is broadly positioned in consumer's wallets.</p>
          <p>For us the shift in spending patterns translated into higher fourth quarter growth rates in U.S. volumes when compared to the third quarter of 2007. Let me repeat that. The shift in spending patterns translated into higher fourth quarter growth rates in U.S. volumes when compared to the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Second, about half of our business is generated outside of United States in regions which are currently experiencing better economic conditions. Our global business model adds diversification to our revenue base and helps to insulate MasterCard from the affects of local economic downturns.</p>
          <p>MasterCard's business is much more sensitive to a disruption in cross-border travel than it is consumer spending or retail sales in any one region.</p>
          <p>Third, the secular shift from paper to electronic forms of payment continues to be strong despite a challenging economic environment in the United States. One example of this is the growth of the e-commerce sector as consumers shift their shopping patterns from in-store to on-line purchases.</p>
          <p>Finally since we don't issue cards, we don't have the risk of credit write-offs, as we are not directly exposed to consumer debt.</p>
          <p>We are closely monitoring the impact that a weaker U.S. economy could have on our customers' payments businesses and we will adjust our resource allocation as our customers manage their plans. Overall, we continue to have confidence in our ability to drive future growth and deliver shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Martina, there are a few developments on page 4 that I would like to highlight. On the legal and regulatory front in December, we received a ruling from the European Commission with respect to our cross-border interchange rates. As you know, we are not economic beneficiaries of interchange, so there is no immediate direct impact on MasterCard's financials. We plan to file an appeal with the European Court of First Instance by the beginning of March. We are carefully analyzing the Commission's decision and hope to meet with the Commission in the near future, to discuss their decision. We intend to comply with the Commission's order during the appeal process and are prepared to take action to ensure that our payment products remain competitive. At this time, we are unable to comment further on the decision.</p>
          <p>Switching gears for a minute, let me provide you with an update on our progress related to SEPA, Single European Payments Area. Despite some of the uncertainties surrounding SEPA, we have made very good progress and we continue to believe that MasterCard has the best product solution for banks in Europe to become SEPA compliant.</p>
          <p>We have completed migration agreements from national use-only brands to Maestro for roughly 20 million cards in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and the Netherlands. All of these agreements cover brand and some also include domestic processing. This is incremental to all Austrian debit cards, which has already migrated to Maestro.</p>
          <p>Additionally, domestic transactions on all cards issued with the Maestro logo can now be routed through our network if an acquirer or merchant chooses to do so. As a result, we have now started processing some domestic transactions on over 140 million cards during both the domestic and Maestro brands in Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany. This means that even if a bank does not migrate their national brands to Maestro, MasterCard can still gain incremental domestic processing business.</p>
          <p>On our U.S. litigation, we have no significant updates to report at this time. As I just mentioned on slide 2, 2007 we recognized gains from sales of a significant portion of our investments in Redecard in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We recognized after-tax gains of 185 million and 254 million respectively. These gains have been reported as investment income on our income statement.</p>
          <p>In October of 2007, our Board approved a $750 million Class A common stock repurchase program that was incremental to the $500 million program announced last April. The aggregate repurchase program totals 1.25 billion. As of December 31st 2007, approximately 4 million shares of Class A common stock have been repurchased at a cost of $601 million for the aggregate program was about halfway complete at that time.</p>
          <p>Also during 2007, we implemented and completed two separate conversion programs in which 11.4 million shares out of an eligible 13.4 million shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock and subsequently sold to public investors. As a reminder our Class B shares are held by our customer financial institutions. As a result of these repurchase and conversion programs as of year-end 2007, Class A shares represented 67% of total shares outstanding, 10% of which was held by the MasterCard Foundation.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Martina for a more detailed update on the financial results.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bob and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be part of the MasterCard Team and I look forward to meeting you all soon.</p>
          <p>Let me begin on page 5 of the slide deck. As Bob mentioned net revenue for the quarter was almost 1.1 billion, an increase of 27.8% versus the year ago quarter. Currency fluctuations of the Euro and the Brazilian Real relative to the U.S. Dollar contributed 4.7 percentage points of the net revenue increase resulting in organic growth of 23.1%. Approximately 2 percentage points of this was due to pricing adjustments.</p>
          <p>Our operating income of $172 million resulted in an operating margin of 16%, a 10.3 percentage point improvement over last year excluding the impact of special items. As we've mentioned in the past, our strong revenue growth enabled us to leverage our operating margin. The margin contribution from revenue growth was more than twice as much as the impact from expenses. The contribution from foreign exchange was less than 1 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Net income was $304 million or $2.26 per share on a diluted basis. Without the impact of gains from the sale of a portion of our investment in Redecard, fourth quarter EPS was $0.89 per share on a diluted basis.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 6, in the fourth quarter we saw double-digit growth in both gross dollar volume and process transactions across all regions. GDV grew 15.2% on a local currency basis and 20.9% on a U.S. Dollar converted basis, $634 billion.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter was the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit worldwide gross dollar volume growth on a local currency basis. And despite the economic downturn in the U.S., our U.S. GDV growth was 10% and U.S. purchase volume growth was even stronger at 11.1%. Both of these growth rates were higher on a sequential basis than the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Although not shown on page 6, worldwide purchase volume was up 16.1% and cash volume was up 12.3%, both on a local currency basis. Additionally, cross-border volume or the volume that is generated from cardholders who travel outside of the country where the card is issued, was up 27.7%.</p>
          <p>Process transactions, or the transactions processed across MasterCard's network, increased 17.2% to 5.2 billion in the fourth quarter. While the full impact of the economic downturn in the U.S. remains to be seen, the global diversification of our business and MasterCard's ability to generate significant volume, transactions and revenue from economies outside of the U.S. remains strong.</p>
          <p>Additionally, MasterCard's performance-based pricing continues to moderate the impact on revenue driven by swings in volume. In other words, because of our tiered pricing arrangements, lower issuer volumes can result in lower rebates and incentives, and as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, historical data indicates that the secular shift from paper to electronic forms of payment continues even during times of economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of the metrics we focus on is revenue yield or net revenue per thousand dollars of GDV. This metric was 16.9 basis points in the quarter versus 16 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006. The improvement in revenue yield can be primarily attributed to foreign exchange, pricing adjustments, and new services.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page 7. You can see that net operation fees increased 25.2% or $167 million to $829 million in the fourth quarter. Gross operation fees increased 25.2% or 186 million to $925 million. This growth was driven by several factors. First, growth in processed transactions, cross-border volumes, and gross dollar volume that I previously described on page 6. Second, the continued impact of pricing adjustments in new programs such as higher utilization and pricing changes for stand-in authorization services, acceptance development fees, and a new fee associated with reward programs to further enhance acceptance that was implemented back in June 2007, and other operation fees driven by new account enhancements that allow our customers to move cardholders to different programs without a change in account numbers.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter net operation fees as a percentage of growth operation fees remained unchanged. Since we won't be filing our 10-K until later in February, we have included the quarterly operation fees detailed for your reference in Appendix B to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page eight. There we show that net assessment increased 37.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2006 or 67 million to 244 million. In the fourth quarter gross assessments increased 18.5% or 89 million to 569 million due to strong GDV growth.</p>
          <p>Net assessment as a percentage of gross assessments also improved primarily due to lower growth in incentives tied to issuer volume as well as the timing and lower growth of merchant incentives.</p>
          <p>In 2007 merchant incentives were more evenly distributed throughout the year versus 2006 when a higher percentage of merchant incentives were recorded as contra-revenue in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page nine to some detail on expenses. During the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 13.5%, of which 3.3 percentage points were related to currency fluctuations. This increase was mainly driven by three factors. First, an increase in personnel cost for additional staff to support customer facing technology and product areas. Personnel cost were also driven by an increase in performance incentive accrual as well as severance expenses resulted from &#x2013; resulting from a corporate resource alignment, which occurred later in the quarter. This resource realignment was undertaken to cut cost in certain areas and provide us with a flexibility to invest in others and to ensure that resources were appropriately allocated to support the company's strategic priorities. This initiative resulted in the reduction of about 100 positions. As of year-end 2007, MasterCard has approximately 5,000 full-time employees.</p>
          <p>The second driver of the increase in total operating expenses was higher professional fees related to legal costs to defend outstanding litigations. And the third driver was a 4.5% increase in advertising and marketing expenses versus the year ago period, primarily due to foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Also, the company made an additional 10 million cash contribution to the MasterCard Foundation in the fourth quarter. This contribution completed our previously disclosed intention to contribute up to 40 million in cash to the Foundation over four years following our IPO.</p>
          <p>On our last earnings call, we said we expected G&amp;A growth in the second half to be slightly lower than it was in the first half. In actuality, second half G&amp;A growth came in at 17.3%, slightly higher than the 16.4% we experienced in the first half. The difference can be more than attributed to the severance expense related to the corporate resource realignment later in the quarter. We have included the quarterly G&amp;A detail for your reference in Appendix C.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 10, let's take a quick look at our full year performance, which was also very impressive. We delivered net income of 1.1 billion or $8.00 per share on a diluted basis. This includes after-tax gains of 254 million or $1.87 per share from gains on the sale of a significant portion of our investment in Redecard.</p>
          <p>We achieved full year net revenues of 4.1 billion representing growth of 22.3% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, organic net revenue growth was 19.2%, which includes approximately 2 percentage points of pricing adjustments. Net revenue growth was driven primarily by strong growth in GDV and process transaction including cross-border volumes, which grew 21.1%.</p>
          <p>Finally, we saw our full year operating margin improve 7.8 percentage points to 27.3% from 19.5% excluding special items in both 2006 and 2007. Similar to the fourth quarter, the margin contribution from revenue growth was more than twice as much as the impact from expenses. The contribution from foreign exchange was less than 1 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on page 11, we generated 770 million in cash flow from operations during 2007, 52 million of which was generated in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with 3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures increased to 156 million in 2007 to accommodate our increased workforce as well as to develop new services and increased capabilities. In 2008, we expect both CapEx and G&amp;A to be slightly higher than they were in 2007.</p>
          <p>As of year-end, we repurchased approximately 4 million Class A shares for an aggregate amount of $601 million. About half of these shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter and in January we repurchased an additional 657,000 shares at a cost of $124 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, for the full year, accrued expenses increased $125 million due to customer and merchant incentives and higher personnel costs.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call back over to Bob for some comments on our 2008 outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Martina. Before moving to the Q&amp;A, I would like to address a few items on page 12. Given the uncertain U.S. economic environment, I would like to provide you with some additional thoughts about our outlook for 2008, keeping in mind some of the points Martina and I have made already about the global balance of our business, our lack of consumer credit exposure and our commitment to adjust our initiatives as the opportunities presented by our customers in different markets evolve.</p>
          <p>First, we are currently evaluating whether it is appropriate to update our existing three to five year long-term performance objectives. This involves multiple factors including the evaluation of current economic and competitive conditions as well as our ongoing planning efforts. We expect to address our objectives at our Annual Investment Community Meeting this spring.</p>
          <p>When thinking about 2008, there are three items I would like to highlight. First, we expect slower net revenue growth than 2007, but still at double-digit rates. Second, our G&amp;A expenses should grow at a rate that it's both slower than net revenue growth and below the 2007 G&amp;A growth rate, as we moderate our hiring as compared with the last year.</p>
          <p>And finally, with respect to advertising and marketing expenses, we anticipate continued modest growth, particularly to support our efforts in international markets. Now these guidelines assume current foreign exchange rates, no global recession, no event which significantly disrupts cross-border travel.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we are thrilled with our fourth quarter and full year results and continue to be encouraged by the transaction growth and cross-border trends we are experiencing. We are committed to growing the business and adding value for our customers, merchants, and shareholders.</p>

          <p>We are now ready to begin the question and answer period. In order to get to as many people as possible in our allotted timeframe, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question with one follow-up and then queue back in to ask additional questions.</p>
          <p>Catena, can we start the Q&amp;A please?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Charlie Murphy representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. We've heard about a price increase, which MasterCard implemented in January '08 to its merchant acquirer customers. Could you size for us what percent of the currency conversion in cross-border fees are cross-border? And then what percent of those fees are charged to merchant acquirers to help us potentially size that price increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Charlie. Let me take that one. First of all, we obviously don't comment on specific price increases until on such time where you actually see it showing up in our financial statements. We can't comment on those obviously for competitive reasons too. It's very sensitive from a competitive point of view. As we said already in the prepared remarks, both the fourth quarter and the full year is actually impacted by &#x2013; positively impacted by 2 percentage points in terms of price adjustments. I think you would call it price adjustment because it's not just a price increase, it's typically wrapped around a value proposition that we have for our customer. I think we're really not prepared to break it into its parts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Adam Frisch representing UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning guys and nice quarter. I think you are the only green stock on my screen so far today, so nice job there. The &#x2013; on the expense items that you spoke about, the A&amp;M and G&amp;A, lots of questions when we get from investors speaking about '08. Obviously the growth isn't going to be strong in '08 as '07, so a lot of focus is going to be on your cost structure. Slower growth is one thing. If you could just provide maybe a better order of magnitude or areas of leverage to give us a better feel for how much leverage you can get out of those two line items in your P&amp;L in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am the one who made a couple of the observations, Adam I think about 2008. And I did observe that we had a great year revenue growth wise in '07 and we do see things slowing but we do expect we will still be able to achieve double-digit growth rates in revenue. On the G&amp;A side, obviously in order for us to improve operating margins we need to have that growing less rapidly than revenues. And currently that has been the case and we plan to manage it so it continues to be the case. Given that we did add a significant amount of resources, Martina described I think <mark type="inaudible" /> the staff count at about 5,000 up from, I think it was 4,600 a year before. We would anticipate slower growth and <mark type="Inaudible" /> additional resources this year. Now clearly to the extent that there is some rapid turnaround in the U.S. or some other developments, we are going <mark type="Inaudible" /> to be in a position to flexibly respond to that but suffice it to say we are sensitive to that G&amp;A line. As you noted in the quarter, we took about 100 positions. That give us additional flexibility on that line as a result of that one-time severance charge we took during the quarter. And again back to A&amp;M, we have flexibility in that line. We have commitments to do things with customers. To a degree those customers expectations change or the market environment changes I think we have an ability again to respond to that. We expect modest growth in that line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, turning to Europe as my follow-up question. Lots of noise obviously in that region around regulatory form; you spoke to it a little bit in your prepared comments. What are your near term expectations for this region and can you maintain your growth in margins in that part of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I keep telling our guy, Javier Perez, who is President of our business in Europe that he has got a tiger by the tail. I think we have great opportunities in that marketplace. We're beginning to see some of the things that the financial institutions and MasterCard has been working on for years come to fruition with some of these debit deals that I mentioned in my remarks as we begin the plastic branded cards, also take on Maestro as a now cross-border brand. That is enabling us not only to capture some additional business when they convert completely to Maestro but also to capture what otherwise have been domestic only types of process transactions. One of the other things we announced earlier in the quarter, this was early in January is that we have also got a deal to bring together our activities with those of Europay France. We are going through the due diligence process on that but we expect that's going to enhance, sharpen our ability to deliver to customers in that marketplace and that's something that we would anticipate a deal closing sometime late this quarter or early in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. Congratulations on a strong quarter. For the past few quarters, we have observed a divergence between GDV growth rates and the overall revenue growth rates. As we look ahead, how should we model this relationship between the two? And then I have a follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will make a couple of comments on that and then Martina you may want to jump in as well. Clearly, one of our strategy has been to broaden our offerings to our customers Anurag and that means that we may go in and provide services, which don't necessarily generate incremental dollar volume. They may not issue anymore MasterCard as a result but it maybe we are in doing advisory services, it maybe we are providing information that enables them to better manage their business. Maybe we are providing stand in processing, which enables them to stand down in some ways some of their own processing capabilities. At the end of the day those things drive revenue but doesn't necessary drive GDV.</p>
          <p>Now the second observation I'd make is there is a mix business taking place, Martina mentioned our very robust cross-border transaction growth, which was over 27% and that type of transaction, those cross-border transactions tend to carry more revenue relative to the dollar volume than our average transaction. So there are a couple of factors that I would identify that are working their way through there over time we may have to come back to you some other things other than revenue relative to GDV. I think those are the two other factors that are significantly affecting that as we see things evolve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me add to this a little bit, if I look at 2007 over 2006 and I am looking now at on, Anurag, I am looking over the whole year, our revenue growth and net revenue growth was 22.3%. If you take foreign exchange out and if you take pricing out you know, the revenue growth was really just a little bit over 17%, so 17.2% you might want to compare that to 3 other factors local GDV growth, which was 14.4%, process transactions which increased 16.2% so you can kind of see you know, that those two components are starting to inch towards that 17% that you saw in net revenue growth excluding foreign exchange and pricing and then really what makes the difference up is our cross-border and as Bob said, our cross-border volume for the year that was 21%. So that just really bridges you between the 14 and 16% up to the 17%. So when you look at year-over-year, 2006 to 2007, you can put it all together that the underpinning is the local GDV growth, the process transactions, but the increased rate was really driven mostly by cross-border volume and that was a little bit &#x2013; but year-over-year was a little bit of a lower incentive growth in there when you look in our numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, 5.2 billion globally and over 18 billion globally for the year. We don't break those down in terms one part of the world or the other. But we think that underlying growth rate, I think are, parallels the GDV growth in many markets and in those markets where we don't do as much domestic processing. So, for example, that would a lot of Europe. We think we have opportunities for faster growth rates there.</p>
          <p>Just to remind everybody, we did a lot of domestic processing in USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, but in most of the other markets around the world, a very small proportion of our own branded transactions that we process. So I would look to see more rapid growth in process transactions outside of those 5 markets I highlighted for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, good morning. Was there any major change in gross dollar volume for us during the month of December given the apparent slowdown in consumer spending? And then if we are looking at modeling our net revenue growth for '08, by how much can we, can a decline in GDV growth be offset by declining contra-revenues from payment incentives? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first part of that. In regard to the other months looked within the quarter, we report quarterly gross dollar volume and as we have mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter and in particular within the U.S. we saw a higher growth rate in the fourth quarter versus the prior year than we had seen third quarter. Now if you take a look within the quarter, we don't track or report the monthly GDV numbers but we do have through MasterCard Advisors, our spending pulse data, which we do report out. That tracks retail sales in United States. And if you take a look at that data for the months of October, November and December and you look at total retail excluding automobiles, then you'll see in the month of October we had about a 7.5% year-over-year growth rate, November about 8.2, and December was about 6.4% versus the prior year. So those were all actually pretty good numbers, but there was a downturn from November to December.</p>
          <p>Now, my colleagues at MasterCard Advisors have advised me to be sensitive to the fact that in the case of the on the U.S. marketplace, got an early Thanksgiving which brought an earlier Black Friday shopping day, so that the November data probably got a little bit inflated because you had a little more shopping, holiday shopping activity in the month of November than we might have had the prior year. So that's what we've seen happening. Obviously from our perspective, balance that we have outside of the U.S. is very important to us as half or more of our dollar volume is being generated outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>I think the second part of your question was related to how to model GDV. One of the things that we've traditionally talked about is the yield relative to gross dollar volume. I think Martina, you've got a couple of data points on that. I would just observe that our lower than what might have been anticipated contra-revenue or incentives this quarter, we believe that we'd rather have our customers meeting or exceeding the expectations and objectives we've set and be incurring those costs. So while it does act as a bit of a shock absorber, when things don't turn out as well as we had hoped because there are performance-based requirements in our agreement, at the end of the day, we think that seeing a robust growth and paying out those incentives is probably in our longer-term best interest. But in regard to the actual revenue yield, Martina, you want to....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, as Bob already said, there are a number of factors that I hear being in play on GDV versus our net revenue. Obviously the growth of the GDV, incentives, rebates, pricing actions that we do and we really try to capture this overall in the concept of the revenue yield. And if I can give a little bit of perspective for, again I'm going to just talk about the full year 2006 versus 2007. In 2006, our revenue yield was 17.3 basis points. In 2007, our revenue yield was 17.9 basis points. So it actually did go up I think 0.6 basis points. And really when you pull the piece parts apart it was really driven by two major factors. One was foreign exchange and the other was really cross-border volume and each of the factors contributed roughly 50:50 to that increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just would like to dig in a little bit more on the trends you're seeing in the U.S. We noted that the card growth is actually pretty healthy, about 6.5% this quarter, contributing a lot to the GDV growth, and the GDV per card growth is actually fairly small. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing really on a per card level versus your &#x2013; particularly your market share in growing your card base in the U.S. as that may pertain to a difference in your consumer level spending exposure versus your overall market growth?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of things. I've said this I think on numerous occasions over the last couple years that we aren't necessarily focusing at any given point in time or any given market on share, whether that's share of cards or share of gross dollar volume, et cetera. We've always talked about trying to get profitable share.</p>
          <p>If you look at what happened last year with regard to MasterCard cards issued. Our financial institution customers added more than 100 million cards to the global marketplace. So we went up from 800 to just over 900 million MasterCards globally, and we've continued to see that double-digit type of growth rate now for several quarters. Clearly, the mix varies from one market to another. In the case of the U.S., we're seeing more rapid growth on the debit side of the ledger than we are in the credit and you can see that in the attachments to our earnings press release. But with regard to explicitly saying, wow! We think we really did a good job in share or whatever, there are swings around abouts in both card and dollar volume share, that's not something that we are particularly focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess what I was getting at is, even if the GDV per card is not growing that rapidly and the consumer is a little bit pressured, do you still feel that the underlying card growth in your business, particularly on the credit side we're seeing more pressure in the U.S. is going to support positive total volume growth on your network even in an instance where the consumer might retrench?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if we go back &#x2013; the answer to that is, yes. I think we're going to see positive growth, because at the end of the day, and I've already observed this and I think Martina did as well, you have that secular movement, which &#x2013; we're sort of riding that wave. And then from a transaction standpoint, we went back and we did look at the data back in the 2001-2002 period, and although we did see some slowdown in what was then still a very robust gross dollar volume growth, transaction growth actually accelerated beyond &#x2013; it was faster than &#x2013; the volume growth. And that was obviously driving at that time lower ticket sizes as you had indicated, but we nevertheless continue to see transactions and obviously a good portion of our revenues are transaction-based as opposed to being dollar volume assessment-based.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I had a follow-up question actually on the cards in force number as well, that Liz just asked. What's driving the growth in number of cards outside the U.S.? We actually saw a nice acceleration in growth sequentially in a bunch of the regions. Is this sustainable and how does the pipeline look?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I can make just a couple of comments on that. We continue to see very positive business momentum I think globally. I look at our results in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and I think they're very good. But if you look outside the U.S., clearly we had more rapid growth in dollar volume as well as cards being issued into the marketplace. I tend to think of the cards as one of the leading indicators of future business potential. It takes a while as a card is issued to get it fully utilized by the new cardholder. But the other dimension obviously is what we're doing in terms of broadening acceptance, that's new acceptance channels, or better penetration, that's cash and checks within a given merchant category.</p>
          <p>Thus far at least the feedback we're getting despite the concerns obviously here domestically with the U.S. economy is certainly Asia is feeling very strong, Middle East, Africa, Latin America very strong. I think Europe we're sensing the economies are slowing a little bit there, and of course everybody is sort of waiting to see does some of the slowdown in the U.S. amplify into more slowdown in these other markets. But thus far, we are not experiencing that, and we remain pretty optimistic that we will be able to see these international markets continue to contribute more than their share of growth that they've contributed in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good and then just a question about the rebates and the incentives recognizing that there's a conservative buffer against any kind of weakness we might see in the U.S. I just wanted to better understand what triggers these rebates and incentives? Is it typically based on nominal dollar volume thresholds or is it based on growth targets? Just trying to better see how that ratchets down as things change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just make a couple of points on that, and I think this is something that's we discussed on a couple of occasions in the past. If you take a look at our typical year-end or fourth quarter back for 2005, 2006, that has tended to be the period of the lowest revenue yield and most challenging sometimes revenue growth comparable quarter-over-quarter. And that's because many of our customers were reaching the lowest priced volume tier based on cumulative volume and cumulative transactions done for the year.</p>
          <p>To the extent they don't get there, they may not get to as low a pricing tier as we had forecast or imagined, then we won't necessarily be either lowering the prices for that volume of transactions or providing them with incentives or rebates. It tends to be driven off of volume in transactions. Then the third area is also in terms of marketing programs. To the extent our customers slow down or decide not to proceed in certain programs because of things going on in their business, that may cause us to also not spend money that we might have otherwise anticipated would be spent. So all three of those factors work their way in, how our customers' volumes, transactions, and marketing plans play out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think just a quick follow-up, actually the severance charge. Did you quantify that number in the quarter? Thanks again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think we were trying to give you a pointer that really when you look at the first half of the G&amp;A growth of 16.4% versus the 17.3 in the second half, it more than is offset by the severance charge, so hopefully you can get to close enough estimate. We also gave you the numbers of 100 positions, but we're really not prepared to give you the specific number.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. In terms of Europe, I'm just trying to gauge the growth potential there for you. Of the 300 plus million Maestro cards you have in the region, you had talked about now doing processing for over 100 million. Is that &#x2013; the difference from the 300 to the 100, does that properly represent the opportunity you have there, as my assumption is that 200 million cards right now are not generating what you would call significant revenue for you now, it's really the processed cards that are generating that revenue?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'd sort of cut it into three tranches using that 300 million, and it's over 300 million Maestro cards that we have in Europe. You have a large number of those cards that also have domestic brands on them. And to the extent those cards cross borders, we would be involved in doing the cross-border transaction processing and have traditionally not been involved in terms of the domestic processing or domestic brand up here. But frankly where Maestro has been embraced as the domestic brand but that might not be something we processed either.</p>
          <p>So, if you take the 300, all 300 generate cross-border traffic for us. The 140 are the number where we also have the connectivity and the capability and are beginning to see in addition to cross-border domestic transactions being processed on those cards. And it may not be every bank in a given market; it may be certain specific issuers continue to have a domestic logo on it. That says to us that we still have significant upside potential not only to get more domestic processing out of those 140 that we could get some but also from the balance where we essentially only get cross-border at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And looking at what's been going on with GDV, you talked about your growth in a slowdown. I was wondering if you're specifically seeing yet &#x2013; if you look at the programs out there that you have, have you seen a slowdown or I guess a more conservative spending stance by the affluent segment because American Express did discuss seeing a slowdown that you guys and Visa haven't really talked about. So, have the affluent been pulling back on some of their discretionary spending? And since you guys are on the non-discretionary side you are not really seeing that. I was wondering if that's something you're seeing in your numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen &#x2013; I guess, we have two sources of data. Obviously we have the actual transactions that we process. And then we also have the spending pulse data that MasterCard Advisors produces that has broader retail spending than MasterCard captures competitive products including cash and checks. With regard to that spending pulse data I've already commented on movements that we've seen and the more rapid growth that spending pulse data has demonstrated what would be considered sort of non-discretionary, it's gasoline, it's food and let's face it, commodities prices, underlying oil and food prices have been contributing significantly to the end what we are all paying when we go into a gas station or go to a grocery store. Consumers clearly because they are spending more to fill up their cards or put food on their table are not participating in certain other areas, not making other investments, home furnishings has been down consistently throughout 2007. Obviously there are some other areas where consumers have cut back in order to support their spending areas. We have seen a similar thing going on with regard to the spend our mix of business, on our cards. Clearly if you go in and analyze and I don't have this data available so I can only speculate, I would assume that we are seeing a movement by most every consumer, more spending in those day-to-day things, doesn't matter how wealthy you are or how high up you are in hierarchy you still are going to pay more for gas. So, I think that mix is happening across the board in various types of cards.</p>

          <p>Well, as you know, 2006 was the last year where we had a sort of atypical pattern and that was because of our heavy-up in the second quarter surrounding the Word Cup event that took place in Germany that year. So, 2007 became a more normalized year where we didn't have the draining forward of spend or a concentration of spend into the second quarter. And I think we've bit back into what I would call a more typical pattern where you tend to see higher spending in the fourth quarter which tends to also be the part of the year where we have our highest volumes of business and the most promotional and other activities taking place to support our various customer programs through the quarter.</p>

          <p>So we could look at for that kind of low single-digit rate over &#x2013; evenly over the year?</p>

          <p>Well, if deals come along or specific promotions or programs come along it can cause some choppiness but I think it will be a more typical seasonality and yes, we do think we are going to have modest single-digit growth year-over-year for the full year.</p>

          <p>Thanks guys. Just a quick one on SEPA, any updates, I know you commented before on some traction? In early '08 there was supposed to be some decisions on some plans that the banks in Europe would have. Can you just comment on any type of &#x2013; what you are seeing there with that and how the progression has been going? Any type of opportunities you think can happen this year regarding that?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I made few observations Darrin about some of the successes that we've had in getting some customer commitments with Maestro. We believe that with our brand on their cards that virtually every financial institution in Europe can be &#x2013; will SEPA compliant in terms of being able of offer their customers access to payments throughout Europe, not uniquely in their home. With regard to the decision I commented on, one of the things that I think a lot of financial institutions were waiting for was some commentary out of the European Commission, in particular the decision that they made with regards to our cross-border interchange fee. An important part of issuers' business model and their financial model is the interchange fee. That is cost reimbursement mechanism. But what I think what's happened now as a result of the decision it's now clear that there is less certainty around the level of interchange fees than may have been present leading up to that but at least we'll be able to work our way through this with the Commission and with our customers. That should, I hope by the end of this year provide a more stable platform to financial institutions to make their investment decisions about how aggressive they are going to be to try to market and promote benefits of SEPA to cardholders and merchants alike. I said some of the early signs we saw was over 20 million additional commitments made across a handful of countries, some additional process income and I remain very optimistic about our position and prospects in that market.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. And really quickly, it doesn't seem to be any real traction on the verbiage around another network forming in the EU, anything you've seen around that as well?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I read about it in the same papers that you do. I can't add a lot of comments or I would just say that we began in 1992 I believe it was, so 15, a little over 15 years ago to build debit product and Maestro was that product. It's been epicentered in Europe over that 15, continues to represent over 50% of the cards that we have globally, over 600 million cards globally over 300 in Europe. So we think that the European banks and a lot of them are now confirming it by the way they are doing business with us, feel that they have what they need in hand, that are now getting on with life. Obviously we're doing our best to encourage them to do that.</p>
