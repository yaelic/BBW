        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2011. Today we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; and David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>
          <p>David will provide a few comments about the results that we released this morning, he will highlight some of EMC's activities this quarter, and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2011. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy, and how EMC is positioned to help customers on the journey to the cloud and in their efforts to handle the growth of big data. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. All of these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of EMC.com.</p>
          <p>As always, we have provided detailed financial tables in our news release and on our corporate Web site. These schedules are quite important in understanding our results, so we do encourage you to take a look at them.</p>
          <p>The call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And lastly I will note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call.</p>
          <p>With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another quarter of excellent results. We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 18% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 23%. We again improved both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin both sequentially and year-on-year and we grew free cash flow by more than 25% on a trailing 12-month basis. Our strong Q3 results underscore that our strategy continues to serve us well. Our sharp focus on key areas of opportunity within Cloud and Big Data is propelling ongoing momentum.</p>
          <p>Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions within these secular trends is resonating with customers. And our disciplined operational execution and control are driving our success. The combination of all three of these has driven our results over the past several quarters, but I'd like to take a moment to focus upon the power of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We achieved $4.98 billion of revenue this quarter, a record amount for any quarter in our history, because the combination of our Storage, Virtualization, and Security offerings is compelling. Our results stem from having market leading products and services in each of these high priority areas of IT spend, and also by leveraging capabilities across our lines of business. For example, we develop our Storage Solutions with an eye toward security and virtualization and customers rely upon our expertise in these areas as they decide where to deploy their IT dollars. In any business environment, customers want to make their IT operations more efficient and more agile. Having a partner who can get them there from start to finish is critical, and this is why we win.</p>
          <p>This advantage was clearly demonstrated by our Information Storage results in Q3 where revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, driven by product revenue growth of 28% in the mid tier. Our Storage portfolio has been taking share in both the mid tier and the high end because we provide best-of-breed products which address customers' specific use cases and uniquely enable them to manage massively expanding data volumes.</p>
          <p>Our high-end product revenue grew 7% over last year's Q3, which we believe is faster than the current growth rate for this segment of the markets. Customers with mission critical data sets needing the very best reliability, availability, and scalability trust VMAX. While customers have traditionally purchased our high-end storage to handle their biggest and most important business applications in databases, they're increasingly using VMAX to meet additional needs.</p>
          <p>Its powerful scale and architecture is ideal for emerging use cases such as service providers using it for customer facing workloads. And with the combination of FAST, Flash and large data drives, VMAX can automatically tier data across various drive types. This capability lets customers store more data types on their SIM, data that in some cases used to be relegated to Tier 2 vendors, and lower their total cost of ownership.</p>
          <p>As a result, we win against high-end and Tier 2 vendors alike with VMAX's unique scale out and altered tiering solution. We had a great example of this in Q3 at a global pharmaceutical company, where we displaced 1.5 petabytes of Tier 2 storage because VMAX is powerful, trusted and smart. The resilience and sheer horsepower of the VMAX architecture was far superior for supporting this customer's database application. Moreover, VMAX's tiering capabilities enabled them to use fewer drives and get better performance at a lower price. The introduction of FAST and Flash drives creates a value proposition that is unmatched and is a key reason why we continue to be the leader in the high end.</p>
          <p>We've been gaining share in the high end and are equally confident about taking share in mid range storage as well. EMC has built out a unique best-of-breed mid range offering over the past few years. This allows us to attack traditional mid range players head on with a new converged VNX product line, from underneath with a new low-end VNXe offering, and from the flanks with market-leading backup and scale-out NAS offerings. As this product portfolio, our distribution channel has doubled the number of partners in its ranks over the past year and vastly expanded the volume through these partners and you get a clear picture of why we're so confident we're taking share in this segment.</p>
          <p>Let me touch briefly on some of these factors that are driving our accelerated momentum in the mid range. Starting with our VNX family, which includes both VNX and VNXe, the transition from prior generation unified mid-tier products is ramping according to plan with over 80% of our new system revenue in this space coming from the VNX family. VNXe, our new simplified storage solution built and priced to meet the needs of the SMB market continues to flourish. VNXe has enhanced our value with existing customers who are deploying it in departmental and remote implementations. VNXe is winning us new accounts as well. Since introducing the VNXe in March, we've added well over 1,300 new to EMC customers with this easy-to-use storage solution.</p>
          <p>As VNXe is a brand new product that just came out this year and our wins here are almost all incremental, it goes without saying that we are also gaining share in the low end. Its value proposition is clear: simple, efficient and affordable.</p>
          <p>VNX, like the VNXe, is also simple and efficient and on top of it, delivers the raw power and effective utilization rates needed by large enterprises. It is winning us new footprint because of its ease of use, its tight integration with VMware and its ability to tier data automatically, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for customers.</p>
          <p>These attributes make VNX a great fit for cloud environments, which is why the largest tire distributor in the country chose to put its private cloud on VNX. American Tire uses its VNX-based cloud, 99% virtualized on VMware, to run its mission critical Oracle e-business suite, and in doing so was able to significantly increase performance during usage peaks.</p>
          <p>VNX replaced incumbent systems at several other companies as well in Q3 including a global pharmaceutical company, a global retailer based in France, a financial software company based in California and an insurance company based in Michigan. With the accelerated growth we saw in our unified platforms in Q3 it is clear we're getting share from traditional SAN and NAS vendors alike.</p>
          <p>Our Backup Recovery Systems business continues to lead the market and exemplify the EMC effect. We still have a lot of room to grow both home and abroad. We expect BRS to continue to be one of our fastest growing segments for a couple of reasons. Our unique approach to de-duplication makes us faster for both backup and recovery than the competition, and on top of this is the integration we've built between the products in our portfolio. Whether a customer is simply replacing tape or virtualizing and working on a next-generation backup architecture, we can provide a best-of-breed solution.</p>
          <p>We saw this in Q3 with one of our long time financial services customers who is now switching their entire backup environment to leverage our de-dupe portfolio. A large city in Finland also expanded its EMC footprint on the strength of our combined BRS offerings, including Networker to create backups of their virtual machines, Avamar for backing up the virtual machine files and Data Domain as the backup targets. Altogether the solution enabled the city to reduce its data protection costs by 28%, the type of result that resonates with businesses and public sector organizations alike.</p>
          <p>With growth that continues to outpace the market, we're clearly gaining share with our differentiated Backup and Recovery Solutions. The same secular shift to ever larger data sets and file sizes is driving demand for our Big Data Storage and Analytics products and services as well. Our offerings here are growing faster than the market with the revenue from our portfolio of Big Data Solutions including Isilon, Atmos and EMC Greenplum up over 100% again in Q3.</p>
          <p>Within this we are encouraged by the continued penetration of Isilon beyond verticals like life sciences media where Isilon has become the de facto standard. Isilon is now expanding its presence in broader implementations that are not vertical specific. In these more general purpose data center uses we're seeing a lot of purchasing for NAS solutions to run things like mail and archiving, file systems and home directories where data consistently expands and requires a solution that can scale where other NAS implementations cannot.</p>
          <p>Such was the case with a large financial service provider in Q3. This bank was struggling with a solution from an incumbent NAS vendor that just couldn't scale for its growing general purpose file shares, archives and backups. Isilon met their need for a viable long-term NAS solution to offer simplicity of a single file system, scalability in line with data growth, ease of use and management and lower CapEx through improved utilization.</p>
          <p>Overall, Isilon has been tremendously successful in solving customer challenges and is making life increasingly difficult for the competition. In addition to the financial services win I just mentioned, there is a long list of competitive displacements across a wide variety of more traditional NAS use cases. In fact in Q3 alone Isilon displaced the incumbent vendor at one of North America's largest natural gas producers, universities in Georgia and New Jersey, an international law firm and an IT managed service provider, to name but a few.</p>
          <p>The big story here with Isilon is that it's quite clear that we continue to be successful in verticals where they've been well known, but more importantly we are taking share and removing competitors in more horizontal use cases where other vendors' clustered approaches cannot scale nearly as easily or as efficiently as Isilon's.</p>
          <p>Our excellent results across our mid-range portfolio demonstrate the synergy of having so many best-of-breed tools in our bag. Sometimes it's the combination Isilon for true scale-out file and VNX for database, as we saw with the displacement in Q3 of one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions, where performance and utilization were falling behind. Often it's Data Domain, giving the opportunity to present its value proposition to a new scale-out VMAX customer, as we saw in numerous deals in Q3. Regardless of the final solution, with EMC customers can be confident of achieving optimal results across their environments, physical and virtual alike.</p>
          <p>Storing massive and growing amounts of data is one thing, making sense of and getting real value out of these data to add business insight is quite another, and what our Greenplum business does very well. Greenplum Solution was built for the era of big data, and for many companies is a next step in their analytic strategy. Greenplum's massively powerful processing capabilities let companies capture more data and make it more readily available. This is true big data analytics, as its more real-time nature explores the details of business operations and customer interactions that aren't typically captured in a data warehouse.</p>
          <p>Such was the case with a win in Q3 at a financial regulatory entity, which now puts Greenplum in three of the top trading and regulatory organizations. This organization was looking to process both structured and unstructured data to aid its decision making, and its legacy system was being overloaded with the dramatic growth of data from outside sources and by the large volume of users. By augmenting their system with Greenplum, they're now able to process the large volumes of data necessary to spot patterns that might be of regulatory interest. All companies are keen to harvest valuable insights like these, and this is why Greenplum's business continues to ramp in terms of both revenue and employees to keep pace with growing demand.</p>
          <p>Looking across our Storage portfolio, it's clear our best-of-breed based offerings is broad enough to meet the needs of a wide variety of customers and a wide variety of needs within each customer. We've always believed that it's best to have the right tool for the job in this market, and that the one-size-fits-all approach would ultimately be unsuccessful. The fact that we're gaining share in and across all our Storage Solution sets is proof that customers agree with our approach. In addition, the fact that competitors are increasingly following our lead underscores the realization that their approaches have been incomplete.</p>
          <p>EMC's Storage Innovation engine continues to produce new compelling products. The latest example is our service side Flash initiative, Project Lightning, and I'm pleased to report that this is progressing well with our first beta unit shipping in Q3. Our approach combines five-nines, Flashing hands array technologies with best-of-breed server Flash and FAST software into a single architecture for a compelling combination.</p>
          <p>While our Storage capabilities are broad, they're also deep, comprising solutions that are second to none. With proven leading edge technology and standards of service, we are consistently recognized as amongst the highest in the industry. Armed with these advantages, we're strengthening our Storage leadership position in the two biggest opportunities in IT today, Cloud and Big Data.</p>
          <p>Another key opportunity for us is building trust in the Cloud, and our RSA Security division is the critical asset that is allowing us to pursue it. With revenue up 16% over Q3 a year ago, RSA is benefiting from its integrated solution set that works across physical and virtual environments. Our Advanced Security Management and Compliance solutions offer the situational awareness that today's dynamic threat environment requires. They are agile, adaptive, coordinated controls that get more predictive as patterns of data movements and user behavior are absorbed, which contain the necessary remediation capabilities to ultimately thwart an attack.</p>
          <p>Our Identity Management and Protection products are also seeing strong demand and benefited from some large renewals in the quarter. Customer trust in our solutions is high, and in fact last month SecurID won Information Security Magazine's Readers Choice Award for best authentication product in 2011. Nearly 200 information security professionals polled in the spring and summer ranked SecurID especially highly for its integration and compatibility with existing infrastructure and its ease of use for end users and its scalability.</p>
          <p>Our longstanding data-centric approach to IT security is clearly the right one. Competitors seeing the advantages to this strategy are now trying to cobble their point products into a more cohesive solution. In addition, security professionals are drawing on our expertise in IT security to discuss best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems. In the past few months, senior RSA officials have participated in APT summits in Washington, D.C. and London and presented recommendations to Congress. We'll continue to leverage our expertise in this space to help build the blueprint for an evolving threat environment within a rapidly shifting IT landscape.</p>
          <p>Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was $171 million, flat from Q2. IIG continues to transition its offerings to lighter weight content-enabled applications on top of xCP using modern virtualized frameworks.  In Q3 we announced Documentum Client for iPad, an app which provides users secure access to information in Documentum and enables them to access, share and collaborate on their preferred device.</p>
          <p>VMware revenue grew 32% in the quarter to a record $941 million, driven by the massive shift to more efficient and more agile cloud architectures for which virtualization is a cornerstone. The popularity of VMware is underscored by the record attendance at VMworld in Las Vegas in August, with more than 19,000 customers, partners, press, and analysts, and by more than 20,000 registered for VMworld Europe and the Asia-Pacific and Japan V Forum events being held this week.</p>
          <p>VMware continues to differentiate itself in the space with virtualization offerings that are far more developed than any other competitors. By building onto vSphere's capabilities with more robust features in storage, business continuity, virtualized security and EDGE functions, modern infrastructure management and monitoring and multi-tenant provisioning resources, VMware continues to enhance its strategic relevance in the data center.</p>
          <p>With our shared vision for offering IT as a service in cloud environments and ultimately via hybrid clouds, the evolution of EMC Storage, Content Management, and Security portfolios is increasingly complementary to VMware's feature set. We have already seen in study after study that EMC is the infrastructure provider of choice in virtualized environments. Yet another study in August showed us extending our share here even further, with 44% of CEOs polled naming EMC as the preferred provider for their virtualized environments. As VMware continues to build out its capabilities, our underlying infrastructure will continue to be second to none for supporting virtualization.</p>
          <p>With VMware's stronger results, the full-year minority interest expectation for VMware has increased slightly. Also, as we advised last quarter, it is important to correctly account for the additional dilution from VMware. Our expectation for the combination of the minority interest and VMware dilution for the full year is now approximately $220 million, an important consideration when modeling consolidated EMC EPS for the year.</p>
          <p>The excellent performance of our Services organization extended into Q3, as customers continued to look to us to build out their cloud architectures and get the most from the information contained in their infrastructures. A great example of this was a multimillion-dollar deal signed in the quarter with a South American telco. As they embark on a multi-year IT transformation to align their fixed and wireless systems, run their business more efficiently, and enable more targeted cross-selling and cross marketing of their products, they engaged us to help drive their cloud, big data, and security strategy implementation.</p>
          <p>Customers also look to EMC to guide them through projects centered on optimizing cost efficiency, such as data center consolidations. This was the case with one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies in Q3, which listed EMC for the consolidation of 10 globally disbursed data centers. This was a strategic win thanks in part to the high quality of prior services engagements which opened the door for even larger opportunities against the incumbent provider, in this case HP, in the future.</p>
          <p>As our products and services portfolio grows and evolves, so does our go to market approach. Our efforts to expand and deepen our channel relationships are paying off for both EMC and for our partners. We have laid a strong foundation with the on-boarding of several thousand new channel partners year-to-date and are now directing our efforts towards leveraging these incremental routes to market. Our progress was recognized early this quarter by Computer Reseller News, which named us a winner in their prestigious 2011 ARC awards and also awarded us a special 2011 tech innovator award for VNXe, a channel-only product.</p>
          <p>We added another channel-only product in the quarter with the Data Domain 160 de-duplication storage system for small enterprise data centers and remote offices. The strides we've made with our channel efforts are manifest in our results with our mid tier product revenues through non-Dell channels growing over 40% in Q3.</p>
          <p>In addition, VCE continues to gain traction, with orders up approximately 50% from Q2. As a single converged infrastructure solution that can be up and running on day one with a single pane of glass for management and a single point of contact for integrated service and support, Vblocks are truly differentiated in the market. The value proposition of a Vblock is perhaps even more relevant in uncertain times as our converged infrastructure means faster and easier deployment that requires far fewer resources and reference architectures. For these reasons we expect demand for Vblocks to continue its rapid growth.</p>
          <p>Across our business, we will continue to improve our technology portfolio, enhance our relationships with customers via our world-class service and sales forces, and build out and deepen our relationship with partners. This approach has served us well and is resulting in clear value for our customers as our results in Q3 and for the past several quarters have shown. In Q3, total revenue grew 18% to $4.98 billion. We reported strong growth internationally, with revenue from APJ leading the way, up 37%, whilst the EMEA revenue grew 15% from Q3 of 2010. Growth in North America was also strong at 16%, where we saw strength in Financial Services and year-over-year growth in Federal.</p>
          <p>The power of our portfolio is also evidenced in our operating results where our faster growing higher margin products continued to drive gross margins in the right direction. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 250 basis points over last year's third quarter to 63%, driven by favorable revenue mix shifts and better gross margins across the business. This improvement helped us to continue to show leverage in non-GAAP operating margin, which increased to 24% of revenue. We are very pleased with the progress we have made here over the last several years to improvements to our mix, improvements to our products and services costs, and efficiencies in our operating structure. And while we remain on the offensive to take advantage of the vast opportunity in Cloud and Big Data, we'll do so while spending prudently and investing wisely.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and cash flow continue to be very strong. Deferred revenue grew 34% to $5.7 billion, driven by strong bookings and renewals. Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong with trailing 12-month free cash flow of $3.8 billion, approximately $500 million than non-GAAP net income for the same period. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. We returned $800 million to shareholders in Q3 via the repurchase of EMC stock. We expect to repurchase the balance of the full $2 billion amount that was authorized by the Board in August before the end of the year. We now expect our average share count for the full year to be 2.235 billion shares.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the outlook, while Joe will give color on what we're seeing in the macro environment globally, one thing is fairly obvious, uncertainty about the global macro environment has increased in the past three months. On the other hand, there are some things we are quite certain about. We're focused on the highest priorities in IT spend, our product portfolio is in the best shape ever, our go-to market approach is well defined, and our reach is expanding. Our partner ecosystem is getting stronger, and our operations are more efficient than ever before. We're focused on our triple play over the long term, and the priorities we laid out to gain market share, invest for growth, and deliver leverage, continue to guide us through the balance of the year. We remain on track to exceed $19.8 billion in revenue and exceed non-GAAP EPS of $1.48.</p>
          <p>In short, our strategy is sound. Our investment approach is disciplined, and our execution is solid. We expect these qualities, which have driven our success over the past several years, to continue to serve us well as we navigate next year and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's Earnings Call. Thank you very much for joining us. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 results. They were hallmarked by impressive top-line growth, which undoubtedly produced share gains for us, and leverage on both the bottom line and in free cash flow. The key ingredient to our success was balanced growth, double digit year-on-year growth across the vast majority of our product and business units, namely in VMware with its leading virtualization and Cloud OS software, in our Information Storage business, in our Information Protection business, in our Information Security business and our Information Analytics business. Additionally, we exhibited this balanced double digit year-on-year growth in our Global Services business and across our major geographies in the Americas, in EMEA and in APJ.</p>
          <p>These impressive results are clear indicators that our hybrid Cloud Computing and Big Data strategies are resonating extremely well with customers. They see our products and services as relevant and they are entrusting us to help them accelerate their journey to the cloud and its significant advantages.</p>
          <p>I would like to recognize the more than 52,000 people around the world who are members of the EMC and VMware family and thank them for their innovation, their hard work, and for their dedication to our customers' success.</p>
          <p>I would now like to add a little more color as to what we saw and experienced in regard to customer spending trends in information technology in Q3, and then comment on what we expect to see in Q4 and a little bit beyond.</p>
          <p>For sure in Q3, we saw that customers were examining their IT purchases with more scrutiny. Customers are looking for, in fact demanding, that their investments in IT yield real productivity gains and help them achieve competitive advantage and/or better intimacy with their customers and constituencies. This increased level of scrutiny resulted in our order flows being skewed more towards the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we saw customer interest in Cloud Computing both private and public to be quite high and growing. Even better news is that EMC and VMware are becoming more relevant as we are being viewed by more and more customers as a strategic partner as they accelerate their plans and journey to the cloud.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we fully expect this customer spending scrutiny and selectiveness towards IT purchases to continue. The winners will be the IT vendors that can truly help customers produce faster ROIs, the ones that have the strategy, products, services, and ecosystem to help customers move to and receive the massive benefits of IT-as-a-service and of course we expect EMC and VMware to remain at the top of this list.</p>
          <p>Within this context, we believe that IT spending in Q4 will represent a meaningful increase over Q3, but perhaps a tick below a normal Q3 to Q4 increase. I know there is a lot of interest in our take on what 2012 might look like, and as always, we will speak in-depth about 2012 on our January call. But since this level of interest in next year is higher than normal, I thought I would share three beliefs we currently hold about 2012.</p>
          <p>First, we expect that there will be growth in global IT spending next year, but this growth rate is likely to be somewhat lower than what we saw and are seeing this year. Second, we are confident that interest in and investment in cloud computing, big data, and security will remain top IT spending priorities.  And third, we expect EMC to continue to gain share in our markets, therefore growing significantly faster than the IT spending growth average.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call. Tony?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, guys, and congratulations on the good quarter. I guess my question would be centered on the mid range product cycle, specifically the VNX. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, where we're at in that cycle, how we should think about the trajectory of that cycle over the next couple of quarters? And any color on how much of that momentum that you've seen is basically leveraging the installed base versus really Greenfield, new competitive wins? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aaron, thanks. Yeah, let me start. So, first of all, as I mentioned in my comments, if you look at what we call Unified, which is basically the old 2Cs now plus VNX, now 80% of the Systems revenue from that category is now in the VNX family. So the transition to VNX has happened. As I mentioned, again in my comments, obviously we are seeing a lot of upgrade potential and upgrades happening from the installed base, but we're also winning a number of new accounts, as I mentioned. And a third comment I'd make is that the channel play with VNX is also very strong. With VNXe, close to 1,500 new to EMC customers this year, and as I mentioned again, the non-Dell channel revenues for the mid tier in total, the biggest piece is Unified, is up 40% year-on-year. So we feel good about the take up, the adoption, the momentum, and also the ability to expand the market into not just the VNX space, but also VNXe.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're basically two quarters into the VNXe cycle, and obviously there's more to go in this cycle. And we have a very robust roadmap, and there will be refreshes and kickers coming to this product family in the not too distant future.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks. A question for Joe. I think, Joe, you've been talking about IT industry growing at kind of the high end of 5% to 7% range for calendar '11, and your commentary with respect to calendar '12 being below those rates. To put some numbers behind it, do you think we're talking about a 3% to 5% outlook for the industry next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I still am convinced that when all the smoke clears and we look backwards at 2011, you will see 5% to 7% growth this year probably, maybe 6% to 7% in the higher end. So next year is, all we're planning for right now from everything we see, is that will slow down somewhat. We're still collecting a lot of data and you read the same analysts and reports that I do, both industry and Wall Street analysts, financial analysts. So there's a lot of work out there. So right now our belief is we want to share <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:58) will be somewhat slower, but we do expect positive growth. I don't want to go into any numbers yet. I promise you we will give you a number when we, our best guess at a number -- not guess, but hard work estimate of a number, when we get to Q1, or January call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And again, congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to focus on your fourth quarter commentary where you mentioned, correct me if I'm wrong, that you expect the third quarter trends to continue but to be slightly below normal. Maybe incrementally can you talk about what vertical are you seeing, in what verticals you're seeing that slight incremental weakness that now leads you to believe you're not going to see the fourth quarter as you hoped you would see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to use a little prose, I do expect that we will see a budget flush. But what I tried to give you is what I'm seeing out there. I think that budget flush is likely to be real and meaningful, but perhaps slightly below what we have seen in other years' Q3 to Q4 growth. So I still think it will be fairly good. Within that, I mentioned areas to watch were public sector, what was happening in southern Europe, what was happening with commodity pricing, and you go down that list, interestingly enough, in public sector, knock on wood, I know others are seeing it, but so far we're not seeing public sector growth slow in the U.S. or in Federal Government. But we did see a little bit of public sector slowdown in Europe.</p>
          <p>I had talked about southern Europe. Certainly that's something to continue to watch and how that impacts the Euro zone. On a commodity front, you read what I read, again, that oil prices are down and most commodity prices are down also. So that doesn't seem to be too big of a potential risk right at this point. The banking sector everybody worries about, it's really interesting. We saw in the U.S. kind of a slow first half, but a resurgence in the second half of this year. In Europe in some of the Euro zone banks, there was a little bit of softness in Q3, so we'll continue to watch that. So that's a pretty broad brush of what we're seeing. But overall, again, to slip back into prose, I do expect that we will see a budget flush that is, albeit, a little bit slower than normal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, guys. Just want to maybe follow up on the December quarter expectations. If I look at $19.8 billion as a full-year run rate, it would imply that December is up about 8%. I think historical seasonality tends to be up 15%. Given the fact that you aren't really seeing a lot of issues in public or financials, could you help us understand why the big delta versus historical trends to what you guys are guiding for December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, understand that our guidance is to exceed $19.8 billion and exceed $1.48, so you can't plug those numbers in. We said that we're going to do better than those numbers. So that is perhaps the most important data point to start off with here. As Joe said, you know, we're expecting to see a strong Q4, a meaningful increase in revenues from Q3, and a slightly lower than normal budget flush, but still a decent budget flush. So we're looking for a strong Q4.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess maybe the part I was trying to get on was do you think FX could have some sort of impact in the December quarter on a sequential basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a year-on-year basis, which is perhaps the way to kind of look at it, quarter end FX rates would give us a neutral impact in Q4. Obviously they were a help on a year on year basis in Q3, so FX would make basically a couple points of difference. We had about 170 basis points of help from FX in Q3 and currently would expect no FX help in Q4.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. David, could you maybe go through the gross margin side a little bit more, both on a quarter-over-quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis, just sort of how much did mix and, say, the efficiencies and sort of the product and services cost reductions that you're seeing contribute to the gross margin improvement just in a little more detail? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Scott. Year-on-year, the big driver is product margins. Basically VMware product margin improved and Storage product margin improved. And the Storage product margins are from two things: one is from a continued mix shift towards our higher-margin products, which is our software products and our appliances, and we've kind of promoted that theme for the last kind of couple years. That helps us.</p>
          <p>But we also got some margin rate improvements in almost all the major products on a year-on-year basis as well. Quarter-on-quarter, we saw a little bit of improvement in product gross margin, but the bigger improvement quarter-on-quarter was in services gross margin where a couple things happened: We saw a mix shift towards our maintenance services which are more profitable than our professional services, but also within our professional services we also saw a few points of margin improvement there, and those are the biggest drivers.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks very much. Joe and David, on VNX, relative to the 1,300 new customers that you have noted for VNXe, what would the comparable number be if you were to just look at VNX? And in terms of share gains in the mid range, specifically for VNX and Isilon, can you share some thoughts on where you think the share gains for each of these product families is coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me do it this way, I don't want to break apart VNX and VNXe, but at the risk of David throwing something at me, I'll invoke executive privilege here and I'll give you a number. Basically we're focused on mid tier, and that's the number we're going to give you, but I'll double back. Year-on-year our VNX products grew over 20% year-on-year. And so in other words, if you took Celerra, CLARiiON last year and you took the same product families this year with VNX, VNXe, we grew over 20%. So the family is doing fine. We're having applicability across a wide, probably all verticals, and in several big cloud topologies, so we're very pleased with the way the VNX family is progressing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Deepak, let me just add to that. Obviously VNX is a huge part of the mid tier, but also in mid tier you've got Isilon, which we said basically doubled on a year on year basis, and you've got Backup Recovery and the Systems that are also carrying the 20% plus growth range as well. So if you look at it all, and it's a really strong portfolio, and I think we're definitely gaining share in the mid tier.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I just wanted to delve a little deeper into your comments on the financials and the Federal verticals, which doesn't sound like you had issues that others have been seeing. Does your commentary about the linearity of the business also apply to these verticals? And in particular, the Federal, was the budget flush in the U.S. as you expected, or was that more attributed to share gains there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe in the Federal. Obviously it was the quarter end for Federal, so there always is some budget flush in the Federal, and we saw some of that. And I do believe we took some share, specifically in the mid tier product family. When you look at the power of the VNX, the VNXe, the Unified, the Data Domain and Avamar products, we have a tremendous portfolio there. And there's no doubt in my mind we took some share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was hoping you could flesh out the Isilon comments a little bit. Dave, you mentioned that Isilon is, as you said, making life more difficult for the competition in general purpose file based workloads. Could you add a little bit more color there on where Isilon is gaining share and why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. I mean, we wanted to make it very clear that Isilon, whilst it may have grown up in a kind of more vertically oriented marketplace is really doing exceptionally well in the horizontal markets, particularly people who just have kind of large scale file requirements. And the key is simplicity. What you do with Isilon is you start small and you basically add to the systems and it scales linearly. It has a very high utilization rate as well. So it really is displacing systems where often other vendors will have multiple file systems that are trying to do a single job and there's a lot of load balancing going on between those file systems. We can just put one in there that replaces the entire amount, and all the examples I mentioned on the call were examples where we've actually displaced incumbent NAS vendors.</p>
          <p>And then in the vertical markets, obviously places like oil and gas, media, where it's becoming a household name, et cetera, is still going very, very well. I think the message here is that what we've got with Isilon and with VNX and with Data Domain is in each case, is we've got a best-of-breed platform, and the best-of-breed platform is providing better utilization, better returns, and it's not providing a compromise compared to a one-size-fits-all. And that seems to be the solution that's winning in the market right now.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. David, can you just remind us the BOM cost improvements in VNX versus CX4, how that helps you in your pricing strategy with VNX in the mid range and sort of what that leverage allows you to do in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Alex. What we said when we introduced VNX and VNXe, and it's actually holding out pretty well, is that with VNX we expect to get slightly higher average gross margins than the predecessor products, and with VNXe we expect to get slightly lower than average gross margins than the prior products. But that is because we're aiming that at a price penetration point. But in total, the gross margins are pretty comparable from the new family to the old family. And that's pretty much how it's been playing out. That's the strategy we talked about in January, and as we've gone through the year, that's what we've seen happening.</p>
          <p>Obviously we've got much more opportunity to sell software and up sell software packages on the VNX. We basically repackaged a lot of our standalone software products into three or four bundles on the VNX, and that's also been successful. So we're getting higher software attach rates, which is also helping gross margins. So we think we're very well positioned competitively on VNX and also VNXe, and the margin profile is as we expected.</p>
          <p>A couple of other things I'd point out as well is that on the VNX, with the higher range models, the kind of high-end and mid tier, we're getting over 50% penetration rates on both Flash and FAST, which is really driving the tiered storage agenda, which again is relatively unique in the marketplace and is also helping with margins. So the strategy as we played it out in terms of bringing the tiering, bringing the differentiation, and having the price point differences is working for us, and the margins are holding up well.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Katy, we have been working very closely with our suppliers, since the initial problems, and of course we're not sure exactly how bad they're going to be, because water levels are still rising over there. But based upon our current information and where our current suppliers are actually based physically, we are not expecting supply chain constraints in Q4, and we're not expecting the pricing environment for our supply chain to change in Q4 either. Bear in mind we tend to be our supplier's largest customer and get pretty good treatment when it comes to situations like this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Joe, I think you had commented that the quarter was a bit more back-end loaded than usual. I would say given the prevailing economic uncertainty in Europe that that actually sounds a little counterintuitive to me. I would have thought that uncertainty would have heightened over the course of the quarter. So perhaps you can explain what you think happened in September that led to that statement. Is there any risk of pull forward from Q4 into Q3? Perhaps you can allude to back log. And then finally related to that, if normal seasonality is kind of 12% to 15%, other than spending levels being a tick below normal, what other considerations should we be thinking about in building our models for Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Toni, you got a lot in there, as your questions usually do. Let me see if I can parse it up a bit. You talked about the order flow, and the forecasts were very consistent. As a matter of fact, as we got near the very end, forecasts were actually going up a tick, which usually doesn't happen. So if we didn't have the forecast for the quarter, I'd say maybe we pulled in, but we didn't. And we don't give backlog numbers, but they're not material in the analysis here. So it really was that we had our sights. The field was forecasted, and we knew where the orders were forecasted, we followed them.</p>
          <p>And those were the orders we got. They just came later, and we saw customers having additional levels of scrutiny or levels within the organization looking at it, purchasing departments getting maybe a little more involved, things you do when customers really want to &#x2013; kind of signs that they're watching their budgets tightly. But also it was clear to us that customers are going to spend on priority items, and they're not freezing.</p>
          <p>So you always get this question, how does this look to you compared to 2008, and I think it looks vastly different, and again we're in considerably different shape. We're in considerably different shape because if you look at your product portfolio in 2008, since then -- we didn't have VMAX, we didn't have VPLEX, we didn't have VNX, we didn't have VNXe, we didn't have Isilon, we didn't have Greenplum, we didn't have Data Domain, or we just got Data Domain in the end of that year. We were on vSphere 3, going to vSphere 4, not vSphere 5. So we as a company are in a lot different situation, and customers while they're being diligent, still want to get productivity gains, and remain competitive.</p>
          <p>And it was really interesting. You watch the financials in the U.S. It was a little bit slower in the first half of this year, and we watched it closely. But in the second and third quarter and what we think will happen in the fourth quarter, as their information gains and their plans to fund different projects can't be held back any longer, they're spending. And I'm sure the same thing will be true in Europe. We saw a little bit of the converse there. Some of the Euro zone banks were stronger the first half than the second half, but again these projects, everybody's got to worry about things like Basel III and other laws we have here in the United States.</p>
          <p>So it's hard to say that any one sector is going to be soft. The one I continue to worry about is public sector as a lot of governments &#x2013; if I had one systemic worry, it would be that, as governments are really stretched and they've got to be. But again, there we see more of a movement to the cloud. So that's kind of a little bit more color of what we're seeing. Did I answer -- I don't know if I answered all your points in your question.</p>

          <p>Well, all we want to say, Toni, is we're planning for a tick below. You can look what we'd normally do a Q3, a Q4 gain, and we believe it will be a tick or a bit below that.</p>

          <p>Hi, just a follow up on some previous questions. As we think about seasonality for modeling next year, so can you comment on whether those supply issues might really hit more sort of the first quarter? And the overall seasonality next year, should we think about a normal year, or perhaps a little more back-end loaded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn, again, my answer on the supply really relates to Q4, which is what we're most keen on locking in. We're still kind of working with our suppliers relative to whether there is any impact on Q1, and we can't really give you an answer, positive or negative, right now to that effect. We're not seeing any alarm bells. We just haven't finished all of our analysis with our suppliers on Q1 yet for supply.</p>
          <p>And then again as Joe said, 2012, we wanted to give you a little bit of color today, because there's been a lot of question just in terms of which direction we think IT spending is going to go, and we've given you a view of a direction, and then really apart from that, we really want to keep our comments on everything else to do with 2012 until we get together again in January when we'll give you a lot more color on what we're seeing out there.</p>

          <p>Great. Maybe to change the topic a little bit, if you can talk about Storage Virtualization, what you're seeing out there in the sense of, is it starting to pick up from your standpoint, and how do you view the competition versus the product that you have out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say this: What we think is the most important aspect of storage is how you auto tier. And customers can store a string of information bits, bytes, you can do it in memory, you can do it in Flash technology, there's several different kinds of Flash technology, there's SOC, there's MLC, there's consumer MLC. You can do it on 15K fibre channel drives, you've got 10-K SaaS drives, you've got huge 3 terabyte, going to 4 terabyte SATA drives.</p>
          <p>So depending on where you store the data, you get tremendous cost differentials, hundreds to one when you go from memory down to some of the tiers are a thousand to one, in cost parameters and speed and everything else. So the real most important thing we see with customers is how we use all those technologies, and then based on hitting their service levels and their policies, we'll automatically tier that storage for them and give them a lower total cost of ownership and again actually produce drive -- arrays that are smaller, more green, and far, far, far more performing. So if you're going to ask me what is the most thing &#x2013; what moves the needle most in Storage, I would tell you it's that.</p>
          <p>Storage virtualization is basically used today for how do you move data across different arrays, and we have, with VPLEX and other things we're doing, we have very strong offerings, and we believe our offerings are best-of-breed. And you're going to see a lot more of some of that technology even be put into the virtualization engines, namely VMware. So we're very, very pleased with our position and actually setting the tone and the path to where this market will go.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Wow, I made it. Can you just talk a little bit about the geographies? Joe, what did you see in Europe? It looks like pre-currency growth was probably like up around 10%. That's still actually pretty good for that environment. And APJ, why was it so good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, let me just give you a couple of the flavors on currency. So, actually, constant currency was near 12% in Europe, so again, strong, but I just wanted to give you that data point. Joe, do you want to comment on the geo colors?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>APJ is just really hot for us, as are other parts of the world. If we broke it out, our business in the Middle East and other countries in the world were quite robust, and the big investment we've been doing in these rapidly growing economies and new developing economies which is paying off. And of course the way those economies are just natively growing. If you look at it, EMC is a much younger company. Despite being formed in 1979, we really didn't get up on Storage until 1991-ish, so our revenues are still &#x2013; of course Q3 is probably more U.S. skewed, which was 54% of revenues, but most of the other quarters, you'll see we still have 52-ish percent of our revenues in the U.S., so obviously we have a lot more potential outside the U.S. for our products and services. And we've been focusing on that percentage, on that potential, while still growing the U.S. at very good percentages.</p>
          <p>So part of it is focus, part of it is the, I think just the attractiveness of our product line. Part of it is the fact that we have younger and have a lot more growth opportunity relative to our potential outside the U.S., and I think that's why Asia &#x2013; in Europe, as you said, as David said, in constant currency we grew 12%, which we think is pretty good. Clearly taking share in Europe. And I think in the U.S., without a doubt we took share. So we had some pretty good balance and good products, good strategy, good go to market, and a lot of good people, and I'm very fortunate.</p>
