          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2010, whether you are present here at our headquarters, this beautiful morning listening in on the phone or watching this via the internet or on a mobile phone. My name is Scott Engebrigtsen, and I have the pleasure of guiding you through this morning's presentations.</p>
          <p>Before I'll do that, I would like to just briefly inform you about the emergency exits for the ones who are present here at Fornebu. In addition to the door you entered into this morning, you will also find exits at the back of the room and at the bottom of the stairs on your right-hand side.</p>
          <p>We hope that everyone has a copy of the material that we have made available for you this morning; that is our press release; the quarterly report, of course; and a copy of the presentation, which will be used here in a minute.</p>
          <p>As I indicated, you can watch this presentation live or in recording on either the Internet or on a mobile phone. And you &#x2013; the ones who are following this on the Internet can also send in your written questions during this transmission, and you'll find information on these alternatives on our website, www.telenor.com.</p>
          <p>As usual, we will have a Q&amp;A session directly after the presentations, and we will start with ones who is present here and then continue with the ones participating on the phone before we open up for individual interviews at the end. And to present the figures today, we have our CEO, Jon Fredrik Baksaas and our CFO, Richard Aa.</p>
          <p>And first, I'll leave the floor to Mr. Baksaas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Scott, and good morning to you all. Fourth quarter 2010 concluded as a strong finish of a solid year. 8% organic growth in this quarter is actually the highest quarterly growth since Q4 2007 when it was 12%. For the year, we recorded 6% annual growth in 2010. This gives us a good momentum entering 2011.</p>
          <p>The main source of growth comes from Asia in which we record 7.6 million new subscribers in this quarter. And this development leaves behind a solid improvement in the operating cash flow margin, which takes us to 19% for the year, including the early investments phase in India.</p>
          <p>I'm also today happy to inform that the Board will approach the Annual General Meeting with a suggested dividend of NOK 3.80 per share, and this takes the dividends back to the normal practices. And coupled with the potential share buybacks, we are aiming to have a competitive shareholder remuneration also in 2011 balancing the growth profile of the Telenor Group.</p>
          <p>In the Nordic operations also in 2010, it was delivered a cash flow level of NOK 10 billion in operating cash flow. And this is including the early start of our substantial investments in network modernizations.</p>
          <p>In the Nordics as such, we have a cash flow operating margin of 23%. Mobile data continues to grow strongly, in particularly strong mobile growth in Sweden and Denmark this quarter. In Norway, the growth in mobile data has been offset to a certain extent by the decline in voice revenues.</p>
          <p>During second half of 2010, we have seen increased competition in Norway and Denmark, putting pressure on revenues and market positions. Intensified competition in Norway has been fueled by the asymmetrical termination rates that Norway is unique about &#x2013; in Europe. This will probably last for another few quarters, but we don't believe it's sustainable long-term. Competition intensify and will vary over time as we've seen in previous phases.</p>
          <p>Our response to this is to preserve market positions through smart market approach and continued investments in customer experience in good services and good network quality, combined with cost efficiency focuses on all work processes. In Sweden, we have entered a network-sharing model with Tele2, and we aim at &#x2013; that this corporation will improve our cost position going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving then to Central and Eastern Europe, the picture is a bit more varied. In Serbia, we see a very visible rebound where the top-line is driven by both average revenue per user and subscriber growth. We are successfully migrating subscribers to incremental tariff plans and our operational excellence initiatives have taken OpEx down.</p>
          <p>It's also good to note that the special sales tax that was applicable for 2010 has been canceled for 2011. Hungary has a different picture. This is a tough market. And &#x2013; but the underlying trend is fairly stable. The reported margin this quarter is, of course, affected heavily by the Hungarian crisis telecom tax that was introduced so suddenly in December last year.</p>
          <p>The full effect for 2010 has been taken in Q4 alone. Excluding this tax, we are, however, able to compensate the revenue development on the cost side. Also in these two markets, we have started network modernization programs both in Hungary and Serbia, and these will go on into 2011.</p>
          <p>In the case of VimpelCom, unfortunately the results and market statistics have for some time indicated that VimpelCom in Russia, in particular, has underperformed competitors and has not been able to take its fair share of market growth. We consider it vital for VimpelCom to improve the operational performance in this respect, in particular in Russia.</p>
          <p>VimpelCom management has to focus and to keep focusing at operating improvements in its core markets. When the potential acquisition of Wind Telecom was announced in August, the VimpelCom stock price suffered and has not recurred since. The Supervisory Board of VimpelCom approved the deal in December with Telenor voting against.</p>
          <p>Telenor supports big growth profile of VimpelCom, also through M&amp;As. However, Telenor still believes that this specific deal is no good for VimpelCom shareholders, and Telenor will vote against at the upcoming General Assembly. In parallel with this, Telenor is taking actions to defend our shareholder rights in order not to be diluted in case the deal will be completed.</p>
          <p>If we then take a look at Asia, which is the number one source of growth for all the Group, also in this quarter, we have a double-digit revenue growth in the established Asian operations.</p>
          <p>In addition to this solid subscriber growth and strong margin, operating cash flow are more than NOK 10 billion from our four Asian established Asian operations in 2010. And this alone is an improvement of NOK 3 billion compared to 2009. We expect solid growth and strong margins to continue also into 2011.</p>
          <p>During second half of 2010, we've seen some increase in energy and food prices. However, we do not believe this to have material impact on our business so far. But, of course, we will cautiously monitor this situation going forward.</p>
          <p>In India, we have continued the strong growth momentum since mid-2010. The Uninor go-to-market model, including the distribution, is gradually improving. And Uninor is consistently taking a significant share of the subscriber growth in the Indian market.</p>
          <p>The multi-SIM behavior, though, is, however, expected to prevail. And it means that Uninor has to position itself as a ultra low cost operator. The regulatory situation in India is still very unclear. More clarity is hoped for as soon as possibly and hopefully within this first half-year.</p>
          <p>According to the license agreement, we are entitled to receive 6.2-megahertz spectrum without additional payments. We have been rolled out according to coverage obligations, and we have established Uninor as a significant challenger in the Indian market. Therefore, we expect Indian authorities to keep their part of the agreement when it comes to spectrum.</p>
          <p>I will conclude this presentation by taking a look on our priorities for 2011. In addition, to work constructively towards VimpelCom Limited, aiming at the improving operating aspects and to secure positive valuation development of the stock price. We are having important operating aspects in the Telenor Group for 2011.</p>
          <p>The ongoing modernizations of the mobile networks will be at its peak this year. A successful turnout of this will be that the core &#x2013; will be at the core of our operations and ambitions for 2013, both when it comes to OpEx to sales of 35% and when it comes to CapEx to sales of around 10%. This coupled with continues improvements in all business processes will take us there.</p>
          <p>There are two significant drivers for growth in the coming year. Number one, Asian markets and economies will grow and so will Telecom's. We intend to compare &#x2013; to compete for our fair share of this growth. Number two, mobile data will grow across the board. All markets are intensely focusing at bringing mobile data concepts to the market, and the market is very responsive.</p>
          <p>The Telenor Group and the <mark type="inaudible" /> will be in the position to take its fair share of this growth by both contributing to growth as well as benefiting from it in the year to come.</p>
          <p>And then, I'll leave the floor to Richard who will take the financial aspects of the reporting package of 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. I will start and end this presentation talking about the guiding. The start will be how we did compare to the guiding this year, and the end will be the guiding for 2011. And also, of course, then sum up the financials. But just check the boxes for this year. We guide on five parameters; top-line growth, EBITDA margin, CapEx to sales and also EBITDA loss and CapEx for India. And I think we're happy to say that we delivered on all five guiding parameters through a strong year and a strong fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Going from the top, the organic revenue growth ended at 5.7, compared to a guiding around 5%. And remember, 2009 was zero growth. So, it's a big improvement. EBITDA margin ended at 30.8, compared to a guiding of 30% to 31%. The underlying improvement in EBITDA margin, excluding India is about one percentage points. Excluding India, we are at around 35% EBITDA margin. CapEx to sales 12%, and that's also an achievement. We have started network modernizations in several of the markets this year. We'll continue at its peak in 2011, as Fredrik said. And we came in at the guiding, considerably down from 2009.</p>
          <p>On India, the EBITDA loss was slightly lower than expected. We expected about NOK 4.5 billion loss. We came in at NOK 4.2 due to lower costs. And this is not cost deferrals, it's actual costs savings in the year. CapEx came in at NOK 1.6, which was in the low end of the range. So again, a strong finish made us good on all the five guiding parameters.</p>
          <p>Then, going more into the various aspects of the P&amp;L and the balance sheet. Starting with the growth, 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter, the reported growth is more than 10%. That comes, in particular, from the strengthening of the Thailand baht and the Malaysian ringgit in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we then break down the growth into the various region, it's very easy to see that Asia, the four established operation in Asia, is the big contributor to the growth. And, in particular, Thailand and Malaysia, which has a very good macroeconomic climate these days. But you also see now that India is starting to contribute significantly to our growth, 1.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The Nordics also should be mentioned. Like Fredrik said, the mobile data growth is strong, and the mobile growth in the fourth quarter is close to 5%. That is in line with the first and the second quarter this &#x2013; last year. The third quarter was slightly lower, and we now see a pick-up again, especially on the mobile data in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Then on the EBITDA, we're reporting an EBITDA of close to NOK 7.2 billion in the fourth quarter. That is up from slightly more than NOK 6.9 in the fourth quarter 2009. And to the right, you can see how this is broken down. And we see that India, now we have a full operation in 13 circles in the fourth quarter 2010, while in 2009, fourth quarter was also launch phase. So, we had a negative effect from that of close to NOK 350 million.</p>
          <p>Then in the CEE, we had the special crisis tax in Hungary of close to NOK 300 million, which was for the full-year 2010, but hit with its full effect in the fourth quarter as it also imposed in the fourth quarter. So, that's a major part of the NOK 307 million on the right side.</p>
          <p>This is then compensated by an improvement in the Nordics. Despite the price competition, we are able to improve our EBITDA in all the three Nordic operations in fourth quarter. But the big effect is, of course, the Asian operations, and all operations are doing well. But, in particular, when it comes to the financial numbers, it's DTAC and DiGi that is behind the major part of this.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx side, fourth quarter is a higher CapEx than the three previous quarters. We are at 15% CapEx to sales. And the big driver behind this is that we now see that the network modernizations really start to pick-up. However, it's significantly lower than the fourth quarter last year where we had about NOK 5.5 billion in CapEx.</p>
          <p>There are two very good explanations for the drop in the CapEx, and that is that we invested in a new satellite in Broadcast fourth quarter last year. That is equal to close to NOK 1 billion at the right under broadcast. And we had a ramp up in India where we spend a lot of CapEx before we launched. So, that explains about NOK 850 million reduction in CapEx.</p>
          <p>But what is good is that we see despite the strong growth in Asia, the Asian operations, excluding India, are able to reduce the CapEx. This is through good planning and also lower prices from the vendors. The Nordics, though, are increasing the CapEx in the fourth quarter; especially in Norway had a high CapEx in the fourth quarter, which is tied back to the network modernization. So, there we see an increase quarter-on-quarter on the CapEx side by NOK 400 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow, we ended the year, excluding India, at a cash flow margin close to 25%, which is good. And we see now how is this broken down by region. The Nordic came out very close to NOK 10 billion. Eastern Europe, excluding VimpelCom, came out to 2.5, but there we have expense to NOK 300 million crises tax in Hungary. So, excluding that, we were almost at par with earlier despite the difficult market situation in Hungary.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the Asian operations, we see the grey bars. Those are the four established operations. They now start to contribute significantly to the cash flow of Telenor, and has now passed the Nordic operations in cash flow contribution. Note that this is on a consolidated basis and that we don't own all these operations 100%. But you will also see when we come to the reconciliation of debt that also we start to take out significant dividends from these operations. Then, including India, Asia now has a 12-month rolling cash flow contribution of NOK 4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Then, trying to reconcile the development in our income statement from fourth quarter 2009 until fourth quarter 2010, we have already discussed the development in revenues, the more than 10% growth in reported revenues, 8% organic and then additional effect from the currency.</p>
          <p>EBITDA improvement reduction from India and the crisis tax more than compensated by strong development in Nordics and Asia. On the other items, we have had &#x2013; we have continued to reduce workforce in this quarter. We have reduced quite significantly throughout 2010 close to 1,500 <mark type="inaudible" />. We also have a loss contract in Broadcast that we have accrued for and then we have some items on the balance sheet that have been disposed, close to NOK 100 million loss on that that was too high value.</p>
          <p>That takes us down to the EBITDA line where we see then significant improvement of close to NOK 400 million. Depreciation is increasing, coming back to that on the full year effect. It's easier to comment on the full-year effect on the depreciation. Then from associated company, we see the contribution now from VimpelCom, which is the main part of the associated company. It's about NOK 1.1 billion in the quarter. We are reporting VimpelCom with one-quarter lag. So, this is the third quarter result of VimpelCom with some adjustments. That is a significant improvement from the fourth quarter '09 figures, but the underlying numbers from VimpelCom are more or less the same. Fourth quarter 2009 was a special quarter in VimpelCom with a lot of adjustments for currency impairment and other one-offs. So, that is not representative.</p>
          <p>Next financials, more or less than same &#x2013; more or less the same. Then on the tax side, the fourth quarter taxes was more in the normal level in 2010, while in 2009 we had a special effect that when we took Grameenphone to the public market, IPO, the Grameenphone in Bangladesh, we got a tax reduction for the full-year of 2009. And that was entirely booked in the fourth quarter. So, fourth quarter 2009 was abnormally low. So, the rest is more or less self-explanatory.</p>
          <p>Then, reconciling 2009 full-year versus 2010 full-year, we see the top-line growth. We report an organic top-line growth of close to 6%. It's slightly lower on reported figures due to the general strengthening of the kroner. We saw the fourth quarter, the effect was opposite. But we have had the first three quarter the strengthening of the kroner taking the reported revenue lower than the organic revenue.</p>
          <p>Then, we see on the EBITDA, we had NOK 30.7 billion last year and NOK 29.2 this year. We have expensed about NOK 3.3 billion more in India in 2010 compared to 2009. This is compensated by approximately NOK 2 billion improvement from DTAC and DiGi. And we also have improvements in Broadcast on Pakistan. But this is weakened by the telecom tax in Hungary. So, we're able to offset about NOK 3.3 all the Indian losses with NOK 2 billion improvements in other operations.</p>
          <p>Then, on depreciation, worth to comment that the depreciations now are about NOK 1.6 billion higher than last year. That comes from two factors. It's the network modernizations. We're swapping out the networks in pretty much the entire Telenor Group. Then, we're accelerating the book value of the old equipment. That accounts for approximately additional NOK 1.2 billion depreciation in 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have the CapEx invested in India in 2009, which we start to depreciate in 2010. That's an additional NOK 700 million. So, that increase the depreciation with NOK 1.9 billion. And then, of course, there is a lower book value. On the rest, the tax is down but reconciles the difference.</p>
          <p>We had no impairments this quarter. And then, on the associated company, we see a big improvement there. And the main reason behind that, we went through in the second quarter that we had an accounting gain of about NOK 6.5 billion related to the Kyivstar VimpelCom transaction. The Kyivstar shares were technically sold to VimpelCom in the project this spring, and then the Kyivstar shares was written-up close to market value. So, that resulted in a gain of NOK 6.5 billion.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that it's only three quarters contribution from VimpelCom in these numbers as we're lagging one quarter in the reporting. That will be corrected then from 2011. It'll still be lagging, but then it will be four quarters included.</p>
          <p>On the tax side, we see last year NOK 4.1 billion in taxes. This year about NOK 5 billion. The big difference there is that we have a dispute with the tax authorities over close to or around NOK 814 million related to how a gain on a total return swap we had in VimpelCom shares should be taxed. We are of the strong opinion that this should be tax exempt, while the tax authorities are of another opinion. But for accounting reasons, we have elected to accrue. So, I think that the rest of it is more or less self-explanatory, and we end the year at an EPS of about NOK 8.9. But note that there's a big effect from this accounting gain of VimpelCom in that number.</p>
          <p>Then, on the debt side, development here it's more interesting, I think, to see the development from the end of third quarter to the end of the year. We had NOK 19.8 billion in debt at the end of third quarter, and we come out of the year at NOK 19.3, fairly stable. And reconciling this, we had an EBITDA of NOK 7 billion. Income taxes paid is NOK 1.5. That is the NOK 800 million we paid in taxes for the total return swap, and it's also now significant taxes in Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx side, it's 3.4. It's slightly less than what we had accrued this quarter. The dividend paid to minorities, this is actually good news because we're now starting to take out significant dividends from the four established Asian operation. Of course, with the exception of Pakistan still, but now both coming from DTAC and DiGi start to contributes significantly to the cash flow of Telenor. And this is then what is &#x2013; all that is paid out to minorities.</p>
          <p>We have received an interim dividend from VimpelCom of NOK 1.4 billion. We have repurchased on shares of about NOK 800 million. We had a share purchase program in 2010 of 3%. This is about 1.5% of that share repurchase program. The rest we will buy from the Norwegian government, and that will be settled second quarter 2011 with a similar amount as we &#x2013; more or less similar amount as we had in fourth quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Then, the revenue share in DTAC is paid in the fourth quarter, a significant amount, NOK 1.9 billion. And then a currency effects on working capital about positive NOK 300 million, taking the debt to 19.3. Then, dividends, following up Fredrik's earlier presentation on this, the Board proposed a dividend of NOK 3.80 per share. Putting that a little bit into the context, it's the highest dividend ever for Telenor, and we're also going out from 2010 of the highest total shareholder remuneration ever.</p>
          <p>Our total shareholder remuneration in 2010 was close to NOK 9 billion, which dividend was slightly above NOK 4 billion and share buybacks close to NOK 5 billion. The payout ratio is in the high-end of the 40% to 60% policy. The Board has set the policy of 40% to 60%, and yesterday they elected to set the dividend at the very high end of that range due to the strong performance. When it comes to the total remuneration in 2011, we have a clear intention to target a competitive remuneration also in 2011, as we did in 2010. So, for the next quarters, we will evaluate how we can top-up the dividend with further share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Uninor and the funding of the Uninor projects. Let's start with operational side. We have communicated earlier that the peak funding of the project should be no more than NOK 155 billion. That is defined as operating losses plus CapEx. When we look at where we are now at year-end 2010, we have, on that definition, funded about INR 79 billion. Our guiding for 2011 is a negative cash flow of INR 37 billion to INR 41 billion. Adding that on to the 2010 accumulated, we get to an accumulated operating free cash flow loss of INR 116 billion to INR 120 billion.</p>
          <p>That leaves an additional INR 35 billion to INR 40 billion before our peak funding. So, that is what we then will have left for 2012, 2013 and 2014. That will be our guiding. And that &#x2013; to achieve that, that will require exactly what Fredrik said earlier, that we really need to establish Uninor as a low cost operator. We have proven now that acquisition machine is going, but we have to further improve the cost structure of Uninor.</p>
          <p>When it comes to how we finance the operation in India, we have invested significant portion of equity into Uninor. We had expected to take out some more of the financing with local project finance with Indian banks. That has proven to be rather difficult given the regulatory environment in India, both in the telecom sector and in the banking sector.</p>
          <p>So, for the time being, we are proving loans to Uninor supported by Telenor. On the longer-term basis, we see that project financing may come available again, but we also see that there will be a further mix of equity and various sources of debt to finance Uninor long-term.</p>
          <p>Then, moving on to the operational excellence. I will not repeat Fredrik here, just saying that this now has a very strong focus in the Group. And, in 2010, we are on track on delivering the long-term ambitions.</p>
          <p>I think I would rather show this slide, and that if you go back and look at guiding on the CapEx, we are guiding long-term CapEx to sales of about 10%. 2010, we came out around 11, if excluding licenses and our investment in India.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we're guiding CapEx of about 12% including India, but there is not that much CapEx in India. So, we're guiding maybe slightly higher in 2011 than in 2010. And the reason for this is this picture, because we see a very good opportunity now, both that we have standardized a lot in or the way we procure network and hardware, we also standardize equipment in itself, and we also see a very good vendor market currently with introduction of Chinese vendors. So, we've taken this opportunity of swapping out pretty much the 2G and 3G networks in the all the Telenor operations.</p>
          <p>Montenegro has already finished its swaps with very good results, and we're now in the midst of the swaps in Scandinavia. Hungary and Serbia have started and will be pretty much finished through 2011, early 2012. And we also now see that DTAC and Grameenphone is starting to move. And we also expect DiGi to start to move. So, I would say, 2011 will be a very busy year. And if you'd done this three, four years ago before we had standardized, before we had professionalized the processes and before the introduction of Chinese vendors, we would have seen a complete different CapEx to sales level.</p>
          <p>And I think it's important to note that we also do this to be &#x2013; enable ourselves for a future with data growth and 4G and so on. But you can justify these investments in its own on 2G and 3G, the equipment prices are at this level. And that's why we also get this accelerated depreciation of the network because we see that the new prices are at a complete different level than in the past.</p>
          <p>Ending this presentation, like I said, starting with the guiding, ending with the guiding, let's start with India. We're guiding an EBITDA loss of around NOK 4 billion. That's more or less in line with this year. But remember, we're investing significantly in the market. And in 2010, we did not have the last five circles in operations before in the second half. So, in 2011 we'll run full blast in all 13 circles.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx side, we're guiding a little bit down on the CapEx compared to this year, NOK 1 to NOK 1.5. That is largely capacity and infill CapEx in the various circles.</p>
          <p>And then, at the end for the total Group, we also expect a strong 2011. We're guiding organic revenue growth above 5%. We're guiding EBITDA margin around 31% and CapEx to sales around 12% to 13%. And remember, these figures, the guiding here is in a year where we have the network swaps pretty much going around in the entire Group, enable us to an even better position in 2012. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ole J&#xF8;rgen R&#xF8;d, First Securities. Despite reports of a tightening competitive pressure in the Norwegian market with several vendors offering NOK 199, almost all-inclusive packages, I think results from Norway were quite decent in the quarter. So the question is, provided the market developments you see now, do you think we have seen the full effect in Q4 from the tightening market pressure, or do you foresee further pressure on the margins and possibly on the ARPU levels going forward? That's part number one of the question. And part number two is we're gradually moving towards a more symmetrical MTRs also in the Norwegian market. How significant do you see that being for Telenor's results in Norway going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The price pressure and the sort of the dynamics in the market is going in certain different phases. Now we have a more competitive phase driven by last year's asymmetrical set up. And there is no doubt that the asymmetrical termination regime basically favors the newcomers in this respect. We've seen this before when also a main competitor today, Netcom, had it some years ago. And this fuels price competition. It's not &#x2013; the Ministry of Transportation's intension on getting better coverage and extending networks in the real districts doesn't come with asymmetrical termination regime. You get price competition. And I think that's seen for the time being.</p>
          <p>Whether we are at the bottom of that curve, whether we will see that pressure continue, there is a different market dynamics beginning 2011 compared to beginning 2012, sorry, 2010. And in that sense, the pressure is more on as we speak than one year ago. And we are used to having these kind of effects in the telecom market, and we need to adjust accordingly, both on balancing service quality, coverage and capacity in the network up against the price level in the market in order to serve our main goal, namely that to hold our market position in Norway in general.</p>
          <p>How long will the asymmetrical sort of advantage last? Well, there is a profile for that in the coming two years. I think the profile is '11 and '12, and gradually this advantage will be reduced. But, as we speak, it's a strong advantage, and I think the first time of revision downwardly on this is June this year or 1st of July, I believe so.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Espen Torgersen at Carnegie. Just a clarification regarding buybacks. Is there any relevance in the present situation with VimpelCom relative to how aggressive you will look at your buybacks for this coming year?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the Board yesterday decided on the dividend as they normally do based on the fourth quarter results, and as we did last year we will consider buybacks over the next quarters with a clear intention to keep competitive share lead.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking a lot about mobile. But the future mobile is very much dependant on faster transport to the station where they send it through radio. That means a lot of new connection with fibers. How are the strategies of Telenor with fiber? And then, I have a second question. How is the satellite business playing into this with handling transport of all kinds of data and telephony?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fiber question in Norway is a very central question that will follow the build-up of data volumes in the mobile networks. And here, 4G will play a vital role. LTE is still in the initial phases. And when the equipment and deployment of capacities are extending into the network, the fiber investments need to go accordingly. And this will follow the market buildup.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, the usage pattern of the market at large decides the speed on which the fiber deployment will extend to more base stations. And this is, in Norway, we have a good fiber status as it is to base stations today, but there is no doubt that this has to be extended to more base stations as we grow LTE data volumes going forward. And, of course, also, the competitive situation will decide that speed.</p>
          <p>In the sense of satellites, the satellites doesn't play any role in this on a domestic scale. Satellites do not play a role in data handling in domestic Norway or domestic Sweden or domestic Denmark, for that matter.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I've got three questions, if that's okay. The first is in terms of fuel price inflation. Can you give me an idea of what assumptions you've got baked into your current guidance in terms of inflation for 2011?</p>
          <p>And then on India, I was just wondering if your &#x2013; if the other licenses that you've got that aren't currently up and running were to be cancelled? If you could give us some kind of indication of what peak losses would be. And does your current CapEx and EBITDA guidance for India actually include rollout into some of those other eight circles over the course of 2011?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I was just wondering, in Norway do you see the &#x2013; after the MTR <mark type="inaudible" />  have happened, do you think there is potential for further consolidation in Norway, especially with some of your competitors being more pressured? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On fuel prices, I think there &#x2013; we don't carry sort of a specific estimate on how this moves forward. But if you get shock curves, that's when sort of consumer demand changes. If you have a controlled-development, you don't get the same type of changing consumer behavior. So, if there is any talk of any sort of assumption here, it's more than &#x2013; it's more that we get a gradual development rather than sudden shocks as we saw them in 2008 as a consequence coming after the energy crisis.</p>
          <p>Then, we have not included in the estimate for India any license costs as such. We are of the opinion that we have met our part of the agreement regarding the licenses in &#x2013; as &#x2013; according to the definition of the license back in 2008. There might be a question on launch, on a date &#x2013; of the date of launch as such, and the penalty discussion as to how and when these launches were made. But remember here also that this is a topic for discussion because some of the delays in the launch phase was created by Indian authorities themselves by introducing new mechanisms in order to approve equipment deployment into the network.</p>
          <p>And then, what was your last question? Yeah, the consolidation in the Nordics. Well, there are probably consolidation possibilities in Norway as it is in the Nordics in general. In Norway, obviously, the Telenor Group is not able to participate in that but that others can find, from their perspective, efficient combinations. We don't &#x2013; that may very well be so. And if it happens, say it's &#x2013; it happens, and the window of that opportunity comes when it comes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have a quick follow-up? On India, in terms of the peak losses and the losses that you're forecasting for the coming year, does that include rollout into the eight other circles that you're not currently present in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the CapEx side, it's &#x2013; part of that CapEx that is also related to the circles we have not yet launched &#x2013; it's a small part.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I also have three questions and apologies for that. One on Russia, one on India and then just a brief one on Denmark. On Russia, maybe a broader question on your <mark type="inaudible" /> conflict over at VimpelCom, how do you think this new conflict compares to the level and type of conflict you had two years ago as far as how can you reassure the market that this conflict won't be as bad as last time?</p>
          <p>On India, you mentioned in your answer to a previous question and earlier in the presentation that the regulatory environment is very uncertain and potentially very different to that which you saw when you decided to commit capital. Do you now see at least the potential scenario for regulation and competition in which you no longer believe you could keep within that INR 155 billion peak funding loss or in which you no longer want to commit cash flow into the market at all?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just on Denmark. It's a very aggressive MVNO player at the moment in the mobile market, which others may want to take out to remove the aggression. Is that a business you'd be interested in taking out yourselves? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This conflict that he refers to regarding VimpelCom has a fundamental different character from what was the case over the longstanding conflict we had in Russia previously. Remember also that that conflict was a &#x2013; was ongoing domestically in Russia and had dimensions which were challenging to relating, whereas this one is based solidly on U.S. law under arbitration in London and has more a black and white type of outcome. Either you get support for your view or either you don't get support for your view, the way it's now raised with the judge.</p>
          <p>And there are two parallel activities going on. Firstly, it is the business case as such by combining Wind and VimpelCom, which we have concluded, the way we have explained this, that it does not benefit the existing shareholders sufficiently. And I think the market is well aware on our viewpoint on that. And then there is the injunction that we filed yesterday after having had a dialogue with the VimpelCom management in such a way that we saw ourselves forced to also use the injunction measurement in order to protect the pre-emption rights that we have under the agreement. And as you know, we challenge the fact that this is a related party transaction the way it was treated. So, these are two sort of separate tracks or separate areas of concern.</p>
          <p>Then, in India will there be an extra bill on frequencies to such an extent that it fundamentally tilt our business ambitions in India? Yes, there might be such an event in India coming out of this process. But on the other side, we will claim that we have met with the obligations under the license terms issued in 2008. And we will claim that we have met these obligations by investing into the marketplace the way we have done. And that we have created competition in the Indian marketplace the way Indian authorities wanted these licenses to do. And we've done that remarkably well on the customer side. We have to face the fact that the competitive situation gives us a challenge on the revenue build-up, but we're working on that. And we have a good network where we have coverage, and we have got good traction with the market the way we go to market in sales and distribution.</p>
          <p>But will there be a bill? Well, we have &#x2013; we will have to see whether there is coming an incoming extra bill on regulations and judge it from there.</p>
          <p>Aggressive MVNOs in Denmark, well have we seen that before? Well, Denmark has been full on these all up through for many years already. So, that business model seems to be well known in Denmark by someone. And, surprisingly enough, there are some of the bigger players that picks them up one-by-one at the later stage. So, I guess this is another try to get to the same goal. That's how regulation plays and how market plays, and that is the stages in Denmark. Will it be picked up at the later stage? Probably yes. So, by whom? Well, that's an open question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could I just ask a follow-up question on India? You mentioned there could be a scenario where your INR 155 billion peak funding is pressured at least. In that instance, would you just have to seek another solution? Simply today, you're guaranteeing that you will not go above that peak funding loss no matter what the regulatory outcome?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a difficult question to the extent I really don't know the regulatory outcome. I think we have to sort of carefully analyze the regulatory outcome when that regulatory outcome is available.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there. I've got two questions. The first one was Norwegian mobile EBITDA was, obviously, quite strong in the Q4. I just wondered, how sustainable is it to continue holding back on marketing costs in Norway in order to protect EBITDA whilst also maintaining market share and keeping revenue fairly flat?</p>
          <p>And the second one was on Eastern Europe. You've obviously showing signs of recovery in Serbia and Montenegro in particular. How much do you feel this is the economic recovery and how much it is winning market share of some of your competitors, which are talking more about stabilization still in the region rather than recovery? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me comment on Central and Eastern Europe, and we could follow-up on Norway afterwards. There is a rebound in Serbia as we see it right now. And Telenor Serbia is building, to a certain extent, market share, as well as building revenues per user. So, it's a &#x2013; and this is done through a systematic approach from the management to Telenor Serbia into the marketplace, understanding the dynamics and taking advantage of positioning Telenor Serbia favorably.</p>
          <p>So, I think there is good work being done by the Telenor Serbia management for the time being. And that such a momentum is such &#x2013; is very important for a management that feels and have the confidence on moving along. And if you go to Hungary, the economic development in Hungary is quite different from what it is in Serbia right now because the best one can say about the Hungarian economy for the time being is that it's very flattish, if you can accept that work &#x2013; that word. Richard?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the mobile EBITDA in Norway, well, we'll not guide specifically on that. But there is some important facts to note, is that we see now also in the fourth quarter that the revenues from the data side increased by 41%, which is a pretty good underlying growth driver.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have the price competition as we have discussed earlier today, which makes it necessary to further implement cost measure and becomes more effective, even though we think it's of a temporary nature due to the termination regime. We have to adapt to the market and adjust our costs in Norway.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. I'll see if I can wrap a couple of issues into one question. I guess, I mean, if I can just quickly ask a follow-up on VimpelCom. What sort of degree of confidence have you got that your injunction will be heard favorably and that you will have preemptive rights restored? What sort of degree of professional backup have you been able to secure?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps, the operational question. You mentioned that India will have to move to a sort of low cost operator model. Is that really internal looking? Is that just looking your own cost structures, or is this in front of the customer as well? Do you need to reposition yourself as the lowest price offered to the Indian consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Degree of confidence to the extent that we have taken this step, I think we should add that we believe we have the confidence that the case will be heard favorably. If we had had the opposite view, I don't think that step would have been necessary to take. And have we clarified that with lawyers? You bet we have. But to the extent lawyers express themselves, they don't issue guarantees. But, on the other hand, we haven't done this if we believe that we would be rejected.</p>
          <p>And then in India, low cost, ultra low cost. Well, India &#x2013; our interest in India has told us a lot already really. The network sharing principles that the Indian market was known for, is &#x2013; has basically showed its way into other operations as well. Just recently, you might have seen that we adopted a bit of the same type of principles in an agreement with Axiata in Malaysia. And we've done the same in Bangladesh and in other markets.</p>
          <p>So, here the level of cooperation utilizes the assets and the investments better in the industry is something that characterizes the industry for the time being. In addition to that, the Indian market is special. It is a very high intensity in the competition. We have already repositioned the Uninor brand. We did that last summer, and we got new and significantly improved traction with our go-to-market model with Indian customers.</p>
          <p>So, in that sense, we've done that adjustments already. Having seen that, we still need to address the <mark type="inaudible" /> acquisition cost and look for deeper efficiencies going on from here. And this will be at our focus, not only for the sales and distribution but also to utilize the assets and the airtime available in the network even better. And there is always a possibility of executing better from where we are and from the competent space you have.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. One question on India, please. In your shareholder agreement with Unitech, are there any provisions in there that would give you recourse in case that you get an adverse regulatory decision based on what happened before you actually formed Uninor? Or is this &#x2013; is the weight of such potential decisions really falling equally on Uninor, so equally on Telenor and Unitech? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I think we will not comment specifically on the text in the shareholder agreement with Unitech because that is bound by confidentiality agreements. But, what we can say is that we have done our due diligence in India before we went in and acquired shares in Uninor, and a good sense when it comes to what has happened in the past.

          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. First of all, on Thailand, I think you have some 850-megahertz, which you could potentially use for 3G. Could you let us know when you plan to do that? And secondly, on delaying the VimpelCom special general meeting, could you tell us how you plan to do that or if you think you can do that? Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>850 in Thailand is a possibility. A couple years ago when this sort of started to become a feature, and I think it was <mark type="inaudible" /> in Australia that really started to utilize 850 commercially at a higher degree. True Move has been the front-runner for this &#x2013; through an extended, I'd say, test period in Thailand and has, thereby, shown that it has a good potential. Now DTAC has also got an approval to extend the test period for this, and we will do so. I don't have the timeline for that though.</p>
          <p>Then, to delay the general meeting in VimpelCom, I have no comment at this stage. We really have done what we feel is necessary from our perspective. After having a dial &#x2013; having had a dialog with the management of VimpelCom on this issue, we felt ourselves in the position that we had to raise the injunction yesterday. And how this will play into the planned general meeting, we will have to &#x2013; that remains to be seen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, Fredrik. I'd like to return to the Nordic businesses, please. You've been through a restructuring of the Danish and the Swedish business, I guess, the past 12, 18 months, if not more. I'd like to ask you, where are you sort of now relative to where you want to be in those operations? Should we view 2010 as a restructuring year and you're moving into new phase now, or is this ongoing process? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you gave the answer yourself. It's an ongoing process. Really, I mean, telecoms is about change. It's about the change of technologies, of partnerships, relationships. It's about changes. And this is driven both by regulatory instruments as well as the technology side of it. And not a least, the transition to data. It's a phenomenal change.</p>
          <p>So, in a way, the answer is, yes. It's a constant ongoing. It may be so that one structure fits one setting. A new structure might be needed to fix a new competitive setting as we see it evolve in the different &#x2013; in relation to the different services that we see comes up. So, yes, this will be constant part of how we're looking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you happy with the cost structures you have in those operations now, Fredrik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're quite okay where we are coming from through 2010, but every competitive move and there's every change on sort of the competitive balance will have to be addressed once more. And remember back to more than 10 years ago when we were discussing about the downward trend in fixed line revenues in Norway. We were asking ourselves, or you were asking us, will you be able to keep your margin as you execute these changes? And, yes, we did that. And we did in a decade period of time.</p>
          <p>So, I think there is no news into the world &#x2013; this world is for telecom operator is not linear. We need to address any changes that are there and utilize the new technologies when they come in the way we're doing when we're executing the network modernization programs that we have in the three countries, in particular entering now 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I've just got one question. Just in terms of your revenue guidance, you're growing from 8% organic revenue growth this quarter to guidance of about 5% in 2011. It seems like you're sort of indicating that you expect some form of slowdown. Could you maybe just talk through what are some of the drivers for slower revenue growth in 2011 than what you're currently experiencing? Is it the food price inflation you mentioned earlier, or is it something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 5% growth factor compared to &#x2013; the first comment one could make is that, well, a 5% growth factor starting from something that was growing the year before is actually to start growth from a higher level. So, in a way, it doesn't signal that there is a downward trend really. It's a trend that continues. And, yes, we have not sort of planned in this for crisis of the kind we had in 2007 and 2008 after the energy crisis that led to the food crisis that, again, created the financial crisis a bit later. And these kind of crises are not so planned for. But we cannot disregard that they might appear once more in some form and fashion.</p>
          <p>But, as I said, everything is better as a gradual development than shock-like developments. And the drivers for growth, where do they come? Well, they come in Asia for the Telenor Group, primarily, both by customers, a wider usage pattern, economies in strong growth. Again, we heard Indian officials in several settings in <mark type="inaudible" /> pointing to the significant economic growth, even pointing to the double-digit type of growth level going forward for a period of time. And when you travel in India and see what's ongoing, it's quite obvious that the growth is enormous. And rest assured, there is a lot to be done as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I just had a question on your guidance for India. Where do you think revenue is going relative to where OpEx is going to achieve a KON 4 billion EBITDA loss in 2011? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just want to switch back to VimpelCom if I can. Just a couple of questions. When do you expect or what's your best estimate that you might get an outcome to the arbitration action that you brought? And can you confirm what the cost of taking up the preemption rights will be if the injunction is agreed and if the arbitration is successful, I guess, based on <mark type="inaudible" /> current share price? And then, just very quickly, and it's a &#x2013; do you have preemption rights over the preference shares that are due to be issued to Wind as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start on the India arbitration. The arbitration process itself probably have, roughly speaking, a 18-months timeline, whereas the injunction instrument of this has a much shorter timeline and should be available in good time before the estimated time for the General Assembly. Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when it comes to the cost or the investment, rather to say, in the new shares in VimpelCom based on the current price level of the <mark type="inaudible" /> share, that would equate to around $2.7 billion. And to your question of preference share versus common shares, yes, we have preferential &#x2013; or we have preemptive rights on both preference shares and common shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Just a follow-up on Thailand. The 3G option, is that still expected to be a late 2012 event or even later? Just an update there would be helpful. And then a general question on mobile data pricing. It looks like you are still selling "all you can eat" data packages in Sweden. Now, in the past you said such tariffs are unsustainable. So, I guess this remains rather a short-term tactical decision, or is there any change in your general thinking? Yeah, let's leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, update for 3G in Thailand would be appreciated. Unfortunately, the process that was ongoing as it was literally falling apart just this autumn. I think that was unfortunate for the telecom market in Thailand, and I think Thailand is ready for 3G in the same way as we see in the response in Malaysia. But there isn't any new time for that 3G despite the fact that the authorities are pointing to the new regulatory committee that they should work as expedient as they possibly can. And things have taken time under such descriptions before in Thailand. Hopefully, they have a better grip at it this time.</p>
          <p>"All you can eat," I think you have to add the fair usage policy attached to that. And it's very clear that the "all you can eat" principle we are of the opinion that that will potentially create cost structures which will be very difficult to sort of cover into the future. So, the attachment of fair usage policy is very visible in all our subscriptions in &#x2013; for the time being.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. I have two questions please. More sort of clarity on some already asked matters, and the first one is on VimpelCom. You think you'll be prepared to buy for US$2.7 billion worth of VimpelCom shares? Shall we understand that this is your assessment that there is no better investment for you to make at this precise moment than VimpelCom shares in the market? And does that specifically rule out any other M&amp;A activity for the time the arbitration is ongoing in case the injunction goes in your favor in the next 15 days? So, that would be the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to India. Could you clarify please when you said that you'd expect to receive 6.2 megahertz of spectrum in all circles without additional payments? Whether you refer to the 22 circles or to the circles where you have already launched? And in the event where you do not receive spectrum for the circles not launched yet, does that mean you would consider buying spectrum in Delhi, for instance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start on India first, and Richard can move on to VimpelCom afterwards. The extension of spectrum from 4.4 to 6.2 is based upon market position and customer growth. And that is also part of the 2008 definition of the license. So, obviously, our comment on expecting to receive 6.2 without extra cost has to do with the market position that Uninor has taken in the respected circles. In those circles that we haven't launched commercially but only covered the minimum requirements according to the license, then, as a consequence, we wouldn't be eligible for 6.2 as such. So, those things are linked together in that fashion in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to VimpelCom, yes, $2.7 billion is a substantial amount. But, fortunately, Telenor is a financially very strong company. And I think we have three kind of main overriding factors when it comes to the capital allocation, and that is preserve a strong balance sheet, give a competitive shareholder remuneration, and do selective M&amp;A. And when now this opportunity or situation in VimpelCom comes about, we, of course, have to react on that to protect our position in VimpelCom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Coming back to Russia, historically you had a control or exit strategy in all your holdings. Obviously, you do not have control in VimpelCom as you do not consolidate that, but you've had at least some form of control with your shareholder agreement. Now, this severest deal is showing that you have limited control despite the shareholder agreement, and if the deal goes through, you will &#x2013; and if you cannot stop this, then you would be diluted to 25% and you could also risk being diluted out of the shareholder agreement. If this were to happen, would you then evaluate your position in VimpelCom and maybe see this more as a financial asset?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is straight forwardly yes, but we don't believe that that outcome will be the case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd like to know about the 3G plans in India. Do you have any plans to launch mobile or data services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mobile data is also part of 2G. Actually, it's frontrunner of data for 3G. So, the EDGE protocol serves data to, in particular, smartphones very well indeed. And in many markets, we've used that technology for data access for customers for quite a long time before 3G has been made available. So, yes, there will be data offerings. There are data offerings as part of Uninor, and it will grow in importance. But we have no plans of sort of moving into 3G from where we are today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And before we end the session, I'd just like to have &#x2013; ask you one question from the ones participating via the Internet, and that's from Anupam</p>
          <p>Saxena in MediaNama.com. And the question is what has been the impact of mobile number portability in India on Uninor? How is this likely to impact subscriber addition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't aware that you were raising questions as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not. I'm just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You're conveying a question. But on the other hand, I think the answer is clear. Number portability is something that sort of has created the expectations when it has been launched in every market. But experience shows that number portability doesn't really create a momentous change in the competitive situation between the operators. And Uninor being a sole prepaid activity into the Indian marketplace hasn't seen any &#x2013; has seen only marginal positive effects from the introduction of number portability. And remember also that the Indian market is, as of yet, not as focused as to the personal number as we are used to in Europe.</p>
          <p>So, from that perspective, customers in India are used to operate with more numbers through their multi-SIM solution than through that specific number, through one specific number or such. That may, of course, change because number portability has been introduced. So, the initial effects are for Uninor marginally positive.</p>
        </plist>
