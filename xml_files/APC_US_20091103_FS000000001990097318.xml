          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2009 Anadarko Petroleum Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Gerry and I'll be your coordinator today.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. John Colglazier.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gerry.  Good morning, everyone, and I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's Third Quarter 2009 Conference Call.  Joining me on the call today are Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, and other executives who will be available to answer your questions later in the call.</p>
          <p>As we've done in the past, we've posted additional information in our Operations Report that is available on our website.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Jim, I need to remind you that this presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information.  However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss.  You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements on our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release and on our website.</p>
          <p>We also encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.  Good morning, everyone.  As you can tell from the tone of our earnings release last night, we were very pleased with the results of the third quarter.  All aspects of our portfolio are performing as envisioned three years ago post the two major acquisitions made in 2006.</p>
          <p>Specifically, we established a new quarterly record for sales volumes, continued to significantly reduce operating costs and enhance our joint efficiencies, announce new deepwater joint successes and moved our mega-projects forward on schedule and within budget.</p>
          <p>Quarterly production totaled a record 57 million barrels of oil equivalent from retained properties, or a 12% increase over the same period in 2008.  As a result, we now expect our full-year sales volumes to be about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the original midpoint of guidance that we provided in the beginning of the year.  This equates to a projected growth rate of about 7% over 2008 without any increase in our capital program, which we still expect to be within the range of 3.9 billion to $4.4 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Also bear in mind this production growth was achieved while reducing our capital spending on near-term projects by about 35% on a year-over-year basis.  The major contributors to our production growth were from the Rockies region, where our properties continue to deliver excellent results, and from the Gulf of Mexico, where our volumes were about 8% higher than the second quarter. We continue to allocate capital to areas that offer higher liquids yields, and therefore, better margins and value realization. As a result, our production mix better capitalizes on the value disparity between oil and natural gas.</p>
          <p>On this point, crude and NGLs comprised more than 42% of our volumes in the third quarter compared to only 37% in the second quarter.  Examples of the success in pursuing more liquids-rich production are in our Greater Natural Buttes area in Utah, where we realized a full quarter's benefit from the new Chipeta Cryogenic plant, and also our assets in Wattenberg, Colorado, where the production stream is about 40% liquids.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are encouraged by the early results in liquid yields we are seeing in both the Eagleford in South Texas and the Bone Spring drilling results in our Haley Acreage in West Texas.  In the Bone Spring play, our most recent well delivered initial daily production of nearly three million cubic feet of natural gas along with about 1,100 barrels of condensate.  We will continue to evaluate our acreage and activity in both of these areas over the coming periods.</p>
          <p>Our operations team also achieved a number of production milestones during the quarter, including surpassing 500 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas production in Independence Hub, just two years after start up.  Other milestones are highlighted in our third quarter operations report on our website.</p>
          <p>While achieving these milestones and record quarterly production, our teams have also maintained a focus on improving efficiencies to drive down costs.  Though plan our significant improvements last quarter, we continued to reduce lease operating expense on a per unit basis by about 9% from the second quarter and by 15% on a year-over-year basis through the first nine months.</p>
          <p>We've also continued to improve our joint efficiencies as well and have consistently set new spud-to-spud cycle time records across our major onshore operating areas.  For example, 40% of the wells drilled in the Southern region during the quarter were drilled in record time, and we also set a new spud-to-spud record in the Wattenberg field, in slightly more than two days.</p>
          <p>Turning to our global deepwater exploration and drilling programs, these are still in high gear.  I'll start by describing the exploration activity and then discuss our appraisal drilling afterward.  In the Gulf of Mexico, we previously announced the Vito discovery in Mississippi Canyon Block 984, which encountered more than 250 feet of net pay in sub-salt Miocene sands.  We operated the exploration well and have a 20% working interest.  The partnership recently moved the rig on location to spud an appraisal well and we are excited about the potential for this area.</p>
          <p>Exploration activity is also ongoing at our Rickenbacker lower Tertiary prospect in Keathley Canyon Block 470.  We operate the well at a 15% working interest and anticipate reaching TD of about 31,000 feet in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We recently spud the Lucius sub-salt Pliocene prospect in Keathley Canyon Block 875 ,where we operate the well with a 50% working interest.  Lucius has a projected depth of about 21,000 feet and is located just to the north of the ExxonMobil operated Hadrian discovery.</p>
          <p>In Brazil last weekend, the Itaipu prospect pre-salt in Block BMC-32 commenced drilling.  Anadarko has a 33% working interest in this 16,000 foot prospect and is testing its geological features similar to the nearby presalt Jubarte field, which is estimated to be a 2 billion oil equivalent EUR field.</p>
          <p>Crossing the Atlantic to our West Africa program, as you know, we announced the results of Venus, the first deepwater well ever drilled offshore of Sierra Leone and expressed our optimism about its confirmation of the presence of an active hydrocarbon system in this frontier basin.  Venus is located at the furthest western extent of Anadarko's Liberian Basin acreage position and is our view the westernmost expansion of the Cretaceous fan play, which is now bracketed by Jubilee in the east and Venus on the west.</p>
          <p>We also announced last month that the South Grand Lahou well offshore Cote D'Ivoire was a dry hole and we are acquiring new 3D seismic data and reprocessing existing 3D seismic in order to high grade our prospect inventory and determine where the next well will be drilled in our two large multi-prospect Cote D'Ivoire blocks.</p>
          <p>We've identified more than 30 prospects and leads with characteristics similar to Jubilee in our captured acreage in West Africa and remain enthusiastic over the potential of our position across ten blocks covering 8 million acres.  We expect to be back in the trend next year to drill at least two and up to six exploration tests, depending on rig availability.  All of this is in addition to our separate and very active Ghana drilling program.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we've mobilized a rig to Mozambique where it will spud our first obligation deepwater exploration test in the Rovuma Basin at the Windjammer prospect later this month.  We're also currently drilling the onshore Mecupa exploration prospect in Mozambique and hope to have results soon.</p>
          <p>Due to our successful deepwater exploration program, we are actively pursuing an aggressive appraisal-drilling schedule during the remainder of this year and throughout 2010.  Now I'll take a moment to elaborate on this appraisal program for you in some detail.</p>
          <p>At Jubilee in Ghana, we announced the successful Mahogany-4 appraisal well in October, which encountered more than 140 feet of net oil pay. The well was drilled outside the existing Jubilee unit boundary and extends the potential productive area of the field to the south and east.  It also encountered two new oil-bearing sands that will be evaluated through further appraisal drilling on the block.</p>
          <p>Also in the Jubilee area we are currently drilling the Mahogany Deep-2 well and expect to also spud the M5 well in the first quarter of 2010, both of which will test the far southeast corner of the Jubilee area.  With positive results from these many well activities, we would expect that the Jubilee partners and the Ghanian government to consider increasing our net working interest in this world-class field.</p>
          <p>This is because the upcoming drilling is occurring in the West Cape Three Points Block, where we have a higher interest of about 31% compared to the unitized Jubilee field where we hold a 23.5% working interest.</p>
          <p>Other upcoming appraisal work in Ghana outside of the Jubilee field includes drawing on each of our two blocks, one at Tweneboa and one at Odum, to follow up on these recent discoveries.  Offshore Brazil, the appraisal program began with our recently spud Wahoo # 2 pre-salt appraisal well in the Campos Basin at Block BM-C-30.  The well is located about five miles north of our earlier Wahoo discovery and will be drilled to about 19,000 feet.  It is intended to appraise the pre-salt pay zone discovered at Wahoo as well as to test a deeper exploration target.</p>
          <p>We operate the well with a 30% working interest and the results should be available in the fourth quarter.  Following this well, we will move back to the Wahoo discovery well to run a drill stem test of the pre-salt pay we encountered there.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, we plan to spud an appraisal well in our Heidelberg discovery in the Green Canyon Miocene fairway during the fourth quarter.  Anadarko is the operator with an approximate 44% working interest.  Also, as I mentioned previously at our Vito discovery, the partnership has recently moved a rig on location to spud an appraisal well there.</p>
          <p>With additional success from this extensive global appraisal program, we expect to add to Anadarko's existing inventory of mega-projects.  Speaking of these large projects, we continue to move forward on Phase I of the Jubilee field development where we've drilled more than two thirds of wells for Phase I and the conversion of the FPSO stands at about 70% complete. With the approval of the Ghanian government during the third quarter, the project remains on schedule and on budget, with first oil anticipated in fourth quarter of 2010.  The second of our mega projects, Caesar/Tonga, continues to proceed on schedule as well with first production expected in early 2011.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we drilled a development well within this complex located near the Tonga West discovery and the well encountered more than 500 feet of net oil pay.  This well will be tied back to the Constitution spar and we are confident that it will deliver the high flow rates that we are expecting from the four initial producing wells in the field, the third of which has just been spud.</p>
          <p>At the El Merk mega project in Algeria, we have awarded all major contracts, drilled two development wells during the quarter and are meeting our schedule and budget with first production expected in late 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving on to discuss our financial results for the third quarter, we reported net income of $0.40 per diluted share, with items affecting congriguity that are broken out in the table that was attached to last night's earnings release.</p>
          <p>In total, these items increased our net income by $0.51 per diluted share.  We generated free cash flow of more than $400 million during the quarter, with discretionary cash flow from continuing operations totaling approximately $1.26 billion.  Capital expenditures came in positively or below guidance amounting to approximately $850 million for the quarter.  Going forward, we now expect full-year sales volumes to be around 220 million barrels of oil equivalent, a significant increase from the original guidance midpoint of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent that we provided at the beginning of the year.  This equates to a 7% increase over our 2008 sales volumes of 206 million barrels of oil equivalent.  We also increased our 2010 derivative positions in order to ensure proper execution of our capital program in 2010.</p>
          <p>Utilizing primarily costless, three-way collars, we have now protected approximately 75% of our anticipated natural gas production next year with a middle floor average of about $5.60 per decatherm and an average ceiling of about $8.25 per decatherm.  We've also hedged about 70% of our anticipated 2010 crude oil production, with a middle floor of about $64 a barrel and a ceiling of about $91 a barrel.  Beyond 2010, we have laid an additional three-way collars on gas for 2011 and 2012, the details of which are attached to last night's earnings release.</p>
          <p>To briefly recap then, we reported record quarterly production, had strong drilling results in both exploration and development drilling and continued to reduce our operating and capital costs across our portfolio.  The company delivered positive results and built momentum during a challenging economic environment and we believe the results demonstrate the capital efficiency and flexibility of our existing asset base.  As I stated in last night's earnings release, our employees continue to perform well and our portfolio is living up to and in many cases surpassing our expectations.  We also have a very robust drilling schedule still ahead in the fourth quarter, with a number of high-impact wells, which have either spud or are expected to spud prior to year end.  We look forward to updating you on these results and on the performance of our base assets following the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Early next year, we will also more formally provide guidance to the investment community regarding our planned capital spending and operating metrics for 2010, so we'll be limited in our comments on these items today.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'm joined by our executive team, and we look forward to taking your questions.  So, Gerry, if you could open up the lines.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you think about the 30 prospects in West Africa and the two to six that are outside of Ghana next year, is there any interdependency of those prospects?  If you have early success, does it bias you towards six or is it really each one is an independent event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take care of that one.  Dave, it's Bob Daniels.  On the two to six, right now what we're trying to do is get all the wells &#x2013; well data tied into our seismic data.  Of course. we're waiting on the final block of 3D for the Liberian acreage that we shot earlier this year.  We've got the Venus well that we want to tie into that.  We've got the seismic data that was over the Sierra <mark type="audio gap" /> Leone acreage, we're processing all of that.  So it's really going to be more tying the wells into the good data and then high grading the prospects to see which ones we want to test, and then a little bit about the rig availability because we don't have firmly rigs lined up there.</p>
          <p>But what we can say about what we've seen the interdependence related to the two basins, we think we've taken away the risks associated with those because they're primarily associated with source, maturity and migration.  And with the Venus well and the Jubilee well, one in each of the two basins there, we think we've answered that question.  So now we're looking at the individual prospects and they shouldn't be as interdependent between the prospects.  But we still are very excited about what we're seeing out there and look forward to drilling in both the Liberian and the Ivorian basin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you think about the prospect risks and just trap/seal and reservoir and you found reservoir of quality rock now in multiple basins, so is it having a good trap and seal or what would you put your risk factors on to try to think about a probability of success pre-drill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the biggest things are the, what you mentioned there with reservoir, trap/seal and then migration path, making sure that you're going from the kitchen into that trap, and we've seen in some of the drilling we've done with shallower sands, and different things like that, that it's real key to have a good understanding of how the hydrocarbon that's been generated is going to get into those reservoirs and traps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you think about these prospects, what type of range of success rate would you put on them now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're running still between about 30 and 45% chance of success on any of these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still drilling traps out here, so the updip termination of the sands is very difficult to image on the 3D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then as you think about Brazil and the drillstem test on Wahoo #1, what type of flow rates would you need to make that a development?  Can you bracket us there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that the flow rate is going to be &#x2013; I mean we want a good flow rate obviously, but I don't think that we have a number that's going to dictate whether or not it's a development.  I think the most important data point that's going to come out on the Wahoo prospect is the Wahoo #2, five miles to the north and that extends the field in that direction.  So you want reservoir continuity and then we're also pushing the oil water contact down below lowest known.  So that's what's really going to give us the materiality that will get us into a development phase.  But of course, the DST is going to be important to look at the overall deliverability.  We don't anticipate we're going to have problems with the reservoir quality that we've seen there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then last question just on Itaipu, can you talk about time to drill that and any of the parameters as far as the prospect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a pre-salt prospect; looks very similar to the Jubarte complex.  In fact it's just on the flank of that with a little fault separation from it.  We're looking for a similar reservoir quality to what they have at Jubarte, where they're testing one well and it's been flowing for about a year at 18,000 barrels a day from the pre-salt objectives we'll be testing at Itaipu.  The time to drill is probably three to four months.  I'd lean towards the four months just to make sure that we don't have problems. Getting down to that zone can take some time getting through the carbonates above the salt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Merrill Lynch.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Good morning, everybody.  A couple of things jumping back to West Africa.  Jim, what are your thoughts in terms of the percentage holdings you have in some of these blocks, particularly in Liberia, given that you've now sort of established that you think this is a prospective area?  Obviously you've still got some big holdings there.  Are you looking to firm down any of those prospects?  And I guess if I could just add on to that, on your two to six potential drills next year, are you planning to go back to Venus or South Grand Lahou and credit in that program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Let answer the first one.  The one block that we do have 100% of is in Liberia, Block 10 and that's one we'll continue to look at what we do there because there is I think a lot of excitement about this play in general around the world.  And we've had, as you might imagine, most of the companies you and I can think of in the universe wanting to be active there with us, so I don't think the evaluation will be much of a challenge.  But generally, speaking, other than that, we feel comfortable with where we are in terms of our average working interest being about 40% across the play.</p>
          <p>You'd mentioned about South Grand Lahou, I believe, and what we do next year on that. Based on what we saw in the recent well, which as you may know we got drilled pretty quickly, because of the lease terms it was an obligation well and we took about seven months to get the actual agreement lined up.  We loved the blocks, but we had to pick a well off of some old seismic that we had actually processed not particularly for that target that we were aiming at.  We want to make real sure the science leads us on the next set of wells.  And it turns out that we believe based on those results that those are independent of other prospects even to the point where you could see us drilling another well within a mile of where we just drilled one depending on what our 3D interpretation turns out to be.  And do that's why we're shooting some additional seismic, reprocessing the old seismic, and getting a better handle on that to improve the odds in terms of probability of success.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Venus, Jim, are you planning to go back there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we definitely would like to get back to Sierra Leone.  Bob, you might want to talk about which ones would take precedence in the Liberia mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think right now I can't say for sure that we're going to go back to Venus, very similar to what we said during our conference call after the press release.  We need to reprocess that seismic data and tie what we found in the well bore into it and we can't do it with the quality of seismic we have right now.</p>
          <p>So that's what we're working on.  That may show us the lateral to this well bore.  Those sands bloom up and that's a place to go.  We also have beyond Venus, though, additional prospects that we can tie this data into that then we're very encouraged about drilling those.  So whether or not the next well in Sierra Leone is a Venus appraisal well or a new exploratory well, I can't tell you at this point.  But we should have that lined out here in the next three to four months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  If I could just try two other quick ones -- Jim, real quick I guess on Jubilee, do you have any kind of early read as to what your expectation would be in increase in working interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we've got to be careful speaking to that because the government has to be part of that process.  So Doug, while I would love to be more clear with you, it's not in the interest of our shareholders to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I guess a final one then is just jumping back to onshore U.S. for a second.  You didn't really lay out in your ops report what your plans would be in the more oily plays, I guess Eagleford and in that area.  Could you just elaborate how you see things next year as far as where you go next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chuck Meloy will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There's a few things that we're really going to focus on is first in Wattenberg field, where we have a very high oily percentage in the wellstream as well as the value stream and you may know that we recently installed a new pipeline to get Cushing prices out into the Wattenberg field, so realizations have gone up. And we really like what we see and we're increasing the rig count as we speak.  And more than making the rig count as well is with the drilling performance that Jim mentioned earlier, we're just drilling a lot more wells for any single day of rig time now. Now it averages around four days per well.</p>
          <p>We can knock out a lot of wells with the rig fleet that we have, and we're going to be adding to it as we move forward.  The Eagleford, we also see adding an additional rig there later in the year, early next year, as we continue to explore and appraise that play.  And those two areas are going to sort of drive our oily move.  Maybe in addition to that, with the cryo that we have at Greater Natural Buttes, the plant that just came onstream last quarter, we're seeing a lot of greater liquid recovery out of the Buttes, so that'll continue to be a focus for us.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yep, we have one really good well that we drilled this last quarter.  The plan there is to move sort of out of the <mark type="inaudible" /> to some degree and into that Bone Springs for an appraisal program during the latter part of this quarter and early next year.</p>

          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you thinking about natural gas drilling activity over the next, let's call it, three to 12 months, just based on a combination of your various long lead time projects, your existing hedges in these natural gas markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Brian, we are cautiously optimistic about gas prices, but we see a lot of supply and demand fundamentals that make us want to be hedged in that commodity which speaks to why we've done what we did in terms of trying to execute our program, capital program.  So we'll manage our joint activity to reflect kind of where prices are.  As we go through the course of the year, you saw see us very dynamically manage that this year, where we decreased by about two thirds our rig count onshore earlier in the year and then started bringing it up slightly here towards the end of the year.  We won't just use the hedges to justify the drilling.</p>
          <p>We actually will look at the cash prices and try to react to what's happening in the real market and use that &#x2013; the benefit of those hedges for purposes of strengthening the overall balance sheet and achieving growth when it's appropriate to do so.  As we look into next year, we still think that there's a good way to balance the capital program with the cash flow and achieve our objectives for growth without necessarily having to boost up the natural gas production in a significant way.  What we do is we achieve -- is we attack the areas that Chuck mentioned in Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes, is you will see gas come along with that, but it's really liquids oriented.  And that will be the same case for next year if we find that gas prices aren't cooperating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you do find that they are cooperating, is there additional room to add rigs beyond what you've talked about in places like Eagleford, Haynesville or Marcellus?  Or are you more or less at, call it, capacity and therefore we should express the rig increases to occur more in the Rockies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.  And lastly, on the Independence Hub, I think you highlighted in the ops review expectations for an average run rate of about 700 million a day. Is that a going-forward run rate?  Or is that just for some short period of time?  I believe it was running about 900 million a day prior to going down for the separator work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We anticipate that it should run around 700 for the rest of the year. And what we're seeing, Brian, is the original field completions have begun to decline.  You may recall that we put that online in July two years ago now.  We anticipated the plateau to be in the order of 18 to 24 months.  So we're on the long end of that.  It's already produced over 500 Bcf.  So the field has done extraordinarily well. And as you would anticipate, with that kind of time and that kind of recovery, the original completions have started their decline.  What we're doing to mitigate that decline is, we now have a rig in the field doing  a sonic drill on raganza well, and we would anticipate doing several other re-completions and new drills, which should prop up our 2010 volumes, or at least keep them flat.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be a pretty bumpy road here for just a little bit as these completions and the work we're doing, we're anticipating around 700 million a day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  And just to clarify, when you say flat, you mean to maintain a 700 million a day rate?  Or to keep a blended rate of the 900 and then a blended rate of what you're experiencing in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I think around 700 is going to be our capacity at this time.  And I don't see us going back into the 900 range for a while, if ever.  I think the really important thing with it is, because of our working interest blend in the fields, our net volumes have been fairly maintained, and we anticipate around 400 million a day, despite sort of what the top line does.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Phil Corbett with RBS.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.  I've just got three questions.  Just firstly, can we just talk about your 4Q '09 drilling program as detailed on your presentation?  I know &#x2013; I see there that you are talking about drilling Tweneboa and two on Odum.  I thought that that was going to be in the first quarter of next year.  So can you sort of just elaborate on that?  And particularly on Odum, my belief up till now that that was sort of a relatively small discovery, so I'm just sort of be curious to hear why you're going to back and appraise that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on your 30 to 45% chance of success on the prospects in the Equatorial and Atlantic going forward, I mean that sort of seems a bit high to me, particularly at the top end of that range, given these are still sort of strat traps.  So just can you sort of clear up what's going on there?  And just lastly on your interest in Jubilee, I know that you said that you can't elaborate on what you think it might be.  Can you just say, do you think that it's going to be your interest in Phase II that would go up, or will your interest in the whole Jubilee field increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Bob Daniels.  On Odum and Tweneboa, we are going to spud those this year.  The rig fleet in there we're drilling the wells a little bit faster. We've got additional rigs in the, in country.  And we would like to get those evaluated as quick as possible.  Tweneboa we've been very clear about; we want to get back to that.</p>
          <p>We want to drill down a bit; tests to the discovery in a thicker part of that fan complex.  So we're looking forward to that one.  Odum, yes, originally we had said that it was probably going to be a tie-back into the Jubilee.  We didn't know how big it could be.  We've gotten new seismic data.  We've tied it in a little bit better and think that it has more upside than perhaps we thought originally.  And the partnership has all agreed that we need to go out and appraise it.  So we've got the Odum-2 well we're going to be drilling later this year.</p>
          <p>So a lot of activity still on the two Ghana blocks.  In the course of all of our work out there, we have acquired new seismic data. That's helped our understanding, not only of what we've found to date, but also new opportunities and we've identified additional prospects farther on to the east in those two blocks.  So I think you'll be hearing more and more about additional activity on the two Ghana blocks.  Regarding the 30 to 45% chance of success, that would be our PCG chance of success.  So when we run through the risk factors that we had talked about earlier today; source migration, reservoir trap.  Really the &#x2013; we feel very confident we're able to predict reservoir quality. We've proven source in those two basins.</p>
          <p>Our thermal modeling indicates it's in the source kitchen.  We've recovered hydrocarbons from both basins.  So really your risk factors on some of the shared factors is very high.  I mean you're very low risk and so you're really looking at the strat trap component of it and we've got high quality 3D. While we can't image it perfectly, we've proven that it does work out here, with Jubilee, Tweneboa, Odum and Venus with the discoveries we've made. So we think that that's a reasonable chance of success, it's saying one in three chance of success out here.  We are going to drill some dry holes, I think that people need to be ready for that. But we do think we're going to find some significant accumulations in these two basins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly on the Jubilee interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I probably should take you back in history just a little bit.  When the Jubilee unit was formed, it was formed, as I recall and after the first three wells inside that area, and so the unit was confined to the appraised area.  As time has passed, we've continued to drill wells outside that area, outside the Jubilee unit, inside Jubilee field property, but outside the unit. And it's our estimation that, as we've done that delineation, the field has grown substantially as you've seen in the press releases from our partners and ourselves. And the area that is expanding on has been in large part to the east, which is the West Cape Three Points block. And therefore, as that interest is re-determined in the Jubilee unit and it's expanded, that's the context that Jim made his earlier remarks, is that unit has expanded and it's expanded in West Cape Three Points it would increase our interest.  It doesn't take away from the other owners, because it's just a bigger pie.  The unit would be expanded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In phase, and it is &#x2013; would be for the life of the field until another re-determination is made down the road.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just, sorry, just one quick follow up question on that. Did you give a timeframe &#x2013; sorry if I missed it -- for the re-determination, for when you expect that to be resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a process in the unit operating agreement that, essentially after the conclusion of appraisal, there will be a re-determination. But it takes quite a while so, this is not going to happen fast.  It's just the momentum is into the West Cape Three Points block with the recent delineation <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that will happen before drilling or before plus rate four production or perhaps?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>And so just for everyone's benefit, is when we talk about PCG, I presume everybody understands that that's probably a geologic success and then we overlay some economic standards on that, that's then converted to a commercial success, which generally is lower than the PCG.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On your CapEx for the quarter, definitely it came in much better than guidance.  Is this more efficiency that's going filter in through cost deflation across the board?  And kind of how should we think about on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rehan, good morning.  It's Al Walker.  I would answer you that we had some improvement from the efficiency of the stem for the reasons that we've outlined in the operating report that comes from the spud to spud records that Chuck was talking about.  It also has to do with the way in which we're looking at spending capital in the third versus fourth quarter, so not looking for it to be a trend.  So I think that range that we're still guiding you to is a good range.  The timing of some of these spuds and when they actually occur and the money in which we spend during this year could vary a little bit, but we're still very confident of the range.  I think onshore, you're seeing us particularly show good capital efficiency around the things that we're drilling there, and then the negative spending is on target.  So there's just no bad news.  We had done some serious successful work with getting our various vendors down, and you're seeing that both in our LOE and our SMD.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Got it.  Good, thanks.  On the shale program, we have increased our effort over the last few quarters, any kind of particular goal or maybe how the shale kind of fit from a strategic standpoint in your overall portfolio?  From where I stood, I thought the Rockies would be plenty of gas exposure for your portfolio.  Could you maybe, broadly speaking, walk us through &#x2013; walk me through why you set so much more increase efforts on the shale side?  I understand plenty of reserves there, but maybe just from a broad standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think what you're seeing today is the beginning of what we're thinking we're going to look like as we go down the path of a few years from now.  We clearly had seen the economics in the Rockies improve, largely because of the LOE improvement that we've been able to achieve at the field level.  And over the last six months, the ability to get our LOE down as much as we have in light of the now price environment that we're realize with the wellhead, pretty much gives us a better plate to drill on the Rockies.  And of course as Jim mentioned earlier, the liquids that we're getting at the yield at Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes helped those economics quite a bit.</p>
          <p>As we look at the various shale plays that we're involved in, whether it's the Marcellus, Haynesville or the Eagleford, you're seeing there the beginnings of what we're trying to look down the road and understand where we want to position ourselves onshore; we're also trying very hard through the exploratory, appraisal and development activities in each of these not to get too ahead of ourselves because I think as Jim mentioned earlier, we are still fairly cautious as it relates to natural gas pipe discovery dynamics.</p>
          <p>So until we see a little bit more encouragement with the wellhead economics for natural gas going up rather than down, I think you'll see us continue to monitor that pace outside of Marcellus.  Now in the Marcellus, we see probably in our estimation the best wellhead economics of anyplace where we can spend money, and we do like the commercial nature in which that particular shale play we believe can be an additive to our portfolio as well as for industry.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rehan.  On oil shales, of course you know up in the Bakken and different places where they're playing that, we are actively looking to see whether there's places that we can &#x2013; whether it's pure oil or like the Maverick Basin where we have a very liquids-rich stream, because these shales, a lot of them generated oil first and then gas later.  And so if we can get into the area where you have the liquid still preserved, and you have the deliverability, which is really important when you a liquid stream versus gas, so it's not as clear cut, but we do think that the Maverick is going to teach us an awful lot about how these wells perform.</p>
          <p>We do like what we're seeing there in the way of economics based on the liquids recovered.  And so our teams are out looking around the country to see if there's other plays that we would like to get into.  Of course the land grant in Wyoming, where we have about seven million acres, 7.8 million acres, that's another area that we're looking and trying to work to see whether there're things that 10 years ago before shale plays were known might have been missed.  And now we go back in and revisit that, and see if we can take our learnings into that acreage position.</p>
