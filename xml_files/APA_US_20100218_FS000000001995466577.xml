          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year End 2009 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and year end 2009 earnings conference call. On today's call we've taken a little bit different approach from previous calls and intend on using our remarks to provide additional context for the 2009 results and 2010 year ahead.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in order to allow you to focus more on the comments, we've prepared a detailed supplemental data package and placed it on our website. This supplemental information, plus the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is also located on the website at the same URL.</p>
          <p>On today's call we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris will lead off, and he's our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by John Crum, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President &#x2013; North America; then Rod Eichler, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President &#x2013; International; and concluding with Roger Plank our President.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining for us for Apache's 2009 year end results earnings call. 2009 was obviously a difficult year for the industry due to the sharp drop in commodity prices and a weakened economy. Going into the year, Apache decided to reduce our investments to ensure that we live within our means, without need to tap the capital markets or dilute our portfolio. But we ended the year with drilling 53% fewer wells than we did the year before and investing 40% less capital. We have ramped up activity somewhat toward the end of the year but we really won't start seeing the benefits of that until in 2010.</p>
          <p>So in that context we're very satisfied that the Apache's team managed to increase production by 9% for 2009. And we came out of the year with more cash on our balance sheet than we had going into it. And we did this without diluting our shareholders' ownership of our upstream portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, our cost management efforts during the year were successful. We managed to reduce lifting costs per BOE by 20% during 2009. And overall we had strong cash flow from operations after a dismal first start. We generated over $5 billion and had adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion. This performance is a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our portfolio around the world.</p>
          <p>Every Apache employee is focused on maximizing value and growth on every property. And this is easy to claim but very difficult to actually do. It involves an awful lot of geoscience and optimization work. At every location, recompletion, workovers, all add to real value and real growth and you'll see that in our 2009 performance.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to highlight that in 2009 we replaced 101% of our production in proved reserve terms, from drilling and modest acquisitions despite drilling less than 50% of the wells we drilled in the previous year. And our finding cost for all of Apache globally was about $16 per BOE. And the way we really look at that number is internally it's about $13.86 per BOE for all regions excluding the Gulf Coast. And the reason is that the Gulf Coast has a very unique profile at high cost, high cash flow business.</p>
          <p>And try to give you a little more flavor for that, at the end of the year, we ran the full project life internal rate of return on our Gulf of Mexico proved reserves which came out to be almost 30% on a before tax basis. Now that number includes all cash flows from the time we entered the properties, and the future cash flows at strip prices. It included $1.1 billion of net hurricane cost, and it also includes $1.5 billion of future capital cost.</p>
          <p>It doesn't give any credit for new reserves we will continue to add on these properties. So in the aggregate, it means we generated an internal rate of return of almost 30% on a go forward tax basis on more than $10 billion of capital. If you look at it on a net present value basis, excess of 10%, is $7.4 billion. And that's why our Gulf of Mexico portfolio is a great source of value generation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We also took meaningful strategic steps in 2009, including our entry into the global LNG business via our participation in the Wheatstone project in Australia and also becoming the operator of the potential Kitimat LNG export project in Canada. LNG provides decades of stable cash flow which represents a very interesting contribution to our portfolio of assets for the long term.</p>
          <p>We have received many inquiries since we became operator of the Kitimat LNG project in January. And I think all I'll say at this stage is that it's a very promising concept. We believe it could work and be very impactful but at this point we're simply conducting a FEED study. We have a long way to go before Kitimat potentially becomes a real export asset on the ground.</p>
          <p>That sums up everything I'd like to say about 2009. And it's 2010 that matters. So I'd like to outline what we're planning to do for the year and what it means to us. We've been a growth company for 55 years and we focus on long-term growth projects balanced across our commodities and geographies. We don't follow the latest market fashions, because we found they tend to change and we're better off just sticking to fundamental principles of profitability and balance and 2010 is going to be no different.</p>
          <p>We expect another year of production growth in 2010. Our international regions continue to deliver a visible price line of growth projects and deep drilling inventories. In North America, in the aggregate we'll have another stable year, similar to 2009, while our new growth plays there gather some momentum.</p>
          <p>Overall we expect Apache's net production for 2010 to grow between five and 10%, over 2009. And due to project and activity scheduling, we anticipate the first quarter of 2010 will be slightly up over the fourth quarter of 2009 and then it will accelerate after the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As you'll hear from John and Rod, we are executing on a broad and strong portfolio of plays across our global acreage that will sustain our growth and returns for the long term. The 662 net wells we're planning to drill this year will advance 32 development plays and 25 exploration plays across our portfolio.</p>
          <p>To give you a piece of data, the development drilling we do in 2010 alone will contribute 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent net to Apache by 2011. The basis for this balanced growth portfolio is simple, the right critical mass of highly prospective acreage around the world, much of which it is held by production, a good organization with real value and delivery focus and a creative application of technology.</p>
          <p>With that, let me pass it to John, who will discuss North America</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. At the onset of 2009, Apache adopted a cautious approach to North American expenditures in order to allow time for costs to adjust downward to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall we cut 2009 investment in North America by near 50% from the 2008 level. We are very proud of the fact that our regional teams were able to hold production essentially flat, down 1.3%, while drilling 61% fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008.</p>
          <p>While I won't suggest it will be available every year, our large base of HBP properties provided our teams with many opportunities to optimize production from existing wells. This production level was also achieved without any meaningful contribution from new growth plays such as the Horn River and the Granite Wash, which we will be ramping up significantly in 2010 and beyond. You will note that fourth quarter North American gas production was down 4.4% from third quarter. That's mostly due to severe weather in Canada, where we had widespread freeze up problems.</p>
          <p>Just a few of the more important 2009 highlights include the start-up of Geauxpher in May. Eight months later the two-well field is still producing 78 million a day gross, that's 31 million net to Apache. The Horn River activity ramp-up, we drilled a total of 42 gross wells but only completed four. The four wells were completed last summer and continue to produce in excess of 4 million cubic feet per day each. And they confirm our reserves per well in excess of 10 Bcf per each well. We hold a 50% working interest in that activity with partner EnCana.</p>
          <p>The horizontal Granite Wash activity, our first operated Granite Wash well in Hostetter 1-23 H in Wheeler County Texas came on production in late September and continues to produce at a gross rate at 9.5 million cubic feet of gas per day with 600 barrels of liquids. Additional drilling continues confirming the potential of our interest covering over 200,000 acres across the play.</p>
          <p>And then finally the acquisition of the Marathon interest in the Permian basin gives us some 200 quality infill development locations for oil in a core area.</p>
          <p>Moving on to 2010, as we look at 2010, we're going to increase our activity level across North America. The benefit of our very deep portfolio of acreage across the continent which is primarily HBP is that we can adjust our focus to any number of plays as the circumstances dictate.</p>
          <p>I will now outline our current 2010 North American operating plans. It should be noted, and I think this applies across our international regions as well, that while these are our current plans, we will continue to be a nimble, value-driven organization that will adjust our plans as necessary through the year to maximize value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we plan to run an average 26 drilling rigs in North America, nine in the Central region, seven in the Gulf Coast region and five each in the Permian and Canada regions. We currently plan to drill 413 net wells in North America for this year. That will be up from 282 in 2009. Of this 2010 total, 381 will be development wells and 32 exploration wells.</p>
          <p>On the development side, we expect to run 22 rigs. The top drivers of these activities will be in the following four programs: first, our development in the Horn River basin in northeast British Columbia, jointly with our 50/50 partner EnCana. As mentioned earlier, we drilled 42 gross wells in the Horn River basin in 2009 while only completing four. With our pad-style developments, we are significantly more efficient if we drill all of the wells on a pad before we start completion operations.</p>
          <p>The 2009 completed wells were the result of last four wells on the EnCana operated 70-J pad. EnCana drilled additional 11 wells on 76-K pad and another five wells on their 63-K pad by the end of the year. Meanwhile Apache drilled 16 wells on our 70-K pad and an additional seven wells on the 52-L pad during the year. We began completion operations on the Apache operated 70-K pad, the 16 wells in January.</p>
          <p>We are now approximately one third of the way through our frac stimulation program with more than 90 fractures complete. We expect to get another two pads done with 25 to 28 gross wells completed before the end of the year. So in all, we would expect to have 42 to 44 additional wells on production by the end of 2010. There is a little play in the timing as we continue to experiment with the number and sizes of fracs per well to optimize future development. Our efficiency continues to improve through the program and we have completed as many as four fracs in a 24-hour period on several occasions.</p>
          <p>As our drilling activity continues, we expect to leave 2010 with more than 30 wells drilled and ready for completion in 2011. We are targeting a 2010 exit rate of more than 100 million cubic foot of gas per day net from the Horn River. But most of those volumes will be coming on in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>As Steve mentioned, during 2010, we expect to conduct a FEED study for an LNG plant operated by Apache on the west coast of Canada at Kitimat, British Columbia. This facility if we decide to proceed with it, could allow export of significant gas volumes from the Horn River basin as well as other Apache plays in North America.</p>
          <p>Second, our continued development program in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, we currently plan to run an average of four rigs through the year on development plays and drill 29 development wells here up from 17 last year. Our activity in the Gulf this year is off to an excellent start, with positive results on all eight wells drilled so far.</p>
          <p>For perspective, the developments associated with those successes alone will generate a net present value of over $120 million with a 67% after tax rate of return on some $95 million of expected capital invested.</p>
          <p>Third, our horizontal Granite Wash development program is expected to involve an average of five rigs during 2010. We have 29 gross wells, 17 net in our 2010 plans, up from seven net wells last year. With our success to date, we are already planning to increase activity to 25 net wells for 2010. And we're targeting a year-end net production rate of 75 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Granite Wash.</p>
          <p>And then finally, our oil focused Permian development drilling program will involve an average of five rigs for the year and 171 net wells, almost double the 87 net wells we drilled in 2009. The remainder of our development activity in North America will involve an average of eight rigs for the year and 126 net wells across 12 programs, ranging from east Texas tight sand plays to oil targeted plays in Canada, Oklahoma, and Kansas.</p>
          <p>Our activity levels in these 12 other programs will be somewhat reduced from the 133 net wells in 2009, these being primarily conventional plays as we concentrate this year on development of those top four programs I just outlined.</p>
          <p>To give you a sense of the materiality of the 2010 development program, we expect it to provide a net contribution of 52,000 barrels per day in 2011, the first full year of production, with 83% of that volume coming from the top four programs.</p>
          <p>On the exploration front, we will be significantly increasing our North American exploration activity in 2010. We plan to run an average of seven drilling rigs on this activity during the year and drill 32 net wells, up from 12 in 2009. We will pursue eight different exploration programs, representing a balanced range of continuing trend exploration in the Gulf of Mexico to new plays involving horizontal drilling in a number of offshore locations across the continent.</p>
          <p>We are not in a position to talk about most of these for now due to commercial sensitivity. One development we can note is in Eastern Canada where we have completed a transaction with Corridor Resources, under which Apache will fund the testing of potentially large unconventional resources in New Brunswick, close to the East Coast population centers in Canada and the U.S. We will drill and operate at least two wells in that play during 2010.</p>
          <p>We have good reason to believe that the exploration programs we are advancing in 2010 will have resource scale equivalent to or greater than the plays we are now moving into development in the Horn River and Granite Wash.</p>
          <p>On an organizational front, as final note in North America, we have created a new regional unit for the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin has been part of our Tulsa based Central region over the last number of years. We are one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin. The new regional organization will be based in Midland, Texas.</p>
          <p>We put these two regions together in 2002, but due to our growth over the years, that combined capital program has increased tenfold by today. We think separating them will continue the growth in both regions. You will see the performance of these two regions reported separately starting in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod, who will discuss our international activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Apache's international regions reported excellent results in 2009, highlighted by outstanding exploration and development activity and by seeking out and entering into new markets to sell future production of natural gas in Australia and Argentina at more attractive prices.</p>
          <p>Production in our international regions grew by 21% in 2009 to a yearly average 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by drilling successes and significant increases in Egyptian oil and gas production as well as significant increases in Australian gas production.</p>
          <p>Our Egypt region had another outstanding year. Net production averaged 152,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 38% over 2008. For the year, Apache drilled 164 wells in the Western Desert, including 23 wildcats, once again making Apache the most active and successful operator.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter drilling successes in the AEB at Phiops and West Kalabsha 2X in the Faghur Basin along with successful completions in the Matruh Concession and the Jade Field and at Falcon helped drive gross production to a record high 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at year end.</p>
          <p>Apache's Australia region production in 2009 increased 40% to 40,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by the restoration of our Varanus Island facilities. Apache took a large step forward in 2009 toward securing new markets for its Australian natural gas by agreeing to produce our estimated 2.1 Tcf of natural gas reserves in our Julimar discovery through the Wheatstone LNG facility operated by Chevron. We expect to complete the FEED study and make final investment decision in 2011. First production is scheduled for 2015.</p>
          <p>North Sea production averaged 61,400 barrels of oil per day in 2009, an increase of 2.5% over 2008 levels due to increased production from several wells drilled in early 2009 and higher production efficiency for most of the year. During the fourth quarter, we experienced reduced production at Forties Field due to pipeline riser repairs on Bravo platform, which have since been completed.</p>
          <p>Our North Sea region actually had its second consecutive year of production growth. This is a remarkable achievement in a 35-year-old oil field, the largest in the North Sea, which had been in decline for many years before Apache took over operations in 2003. We drilled 17 wells and added 9,200 barrels a day over the year.</p>
          <p>The Forties Charlie 6-3 well, completed in June, has already recovered 1.3 million barrels of oil. And the Forties Alpha 4-5 well completed in January is still flowing water free at nearly 5,000 barrels of oil per day, and has reached cumulative production of 1.7 million barrels of oil.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we drilled 32 wells with a 97% success rate. Net production for 2009 averaged 45,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 5% below 2008 due to a reduction in capital spending in 2009 and lower seasonal takes by customers in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>However, there were two important events for Apache that occurred in Argentina in 2009. First was successfully extending the life of all of our concessions in the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin from 2017 to 2027. Second, we received approval for four Gas Plus projects, which will allow Apache to sell significant quantities of natural gas at higher prices in the future.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2010, we are forecasting a very active development and exploration program across our international regions. We expect to run an average of 28 drilling rigs in our core areas over the year. We plan to drill 299 gross or 249 net wells, which is up from 248 gross or 213 net wells in 2009. Of these 299 gross wells in 2010, 223 or 188 net will be development, and 76 gross wells or 61 net wells will be exploratory.</p>
          <p>In the development area, I'd like to highlight four major programs driving our drilling activity in 2010. Firstly, we'll continue the full field development and waterflood programs in Egypt at the Heba and Asala Ridge fields in East Bahariya, which will involve six rigs and 111 wells, of which 55 are producing wells. We presently produce about 70,000 barrels a day gross from our secondary recovery projects in Egypt.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we'll continue our Cretaceous and Jurassic oil and rich gas development projects at our Greater Khalda area in Egypt, employing six rigs to drill 33 wells.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, our Forties oil field development program in North Sea will employ two platform rigs and a jack up to drill 15 new wells. Among the new developments is our Mall discovery from the fourth quarter 2009, which we are progressing to achieve first production of 5,000 barrels of oil per day by midyear.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our Gas Plus development programs in Argentina will average three rigs drilling 21 wells in 2010. Gas Plus developments will be our drilling focus in Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin as these will benefit from sales prices of $4.10 per million Btu on 10 million a day contracts for 2010. And $5 per million Btu on 50 million a day contracts beginning in 2011. Additionally we are presently progressing three new Gas Plus contracts for approval.</p>
          <p>I should note that the first three of these four largest development programs all target oil. The remaining 43 development wells are spread over six different programs across our core areas and are also focused primarily on oil. We expect this development drilling program for the year to grow to contribute around 50,000 barrels of oil per day of new net production by its first full year of contribution in 2011.</p>
          <p>During 2010 we will continue to progress other material projects in our longer-term growth pipeline, projects that have resulted from exploration discoveries in prior years. The first of these will be production from our Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects in Australia which are expected to contribute 40,000 barrels a day of new oil &#x2013; net new oil production. As we reported earlier this week, Van Gogh has already started production. These volumes are incremental to the contribution from our development drilling programs I just outlined. Ongoing projects in Australia include the Reindeer, Halyard, Macedon and Julimar gas developments and the Coniston oil development.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, expansion of our oil gathering and transportation facilities as a result of our 2009 Faghur Basin discoveries at Phiops, in West Kalabsha will be complete by the fourth quarter. The capacity of these new facilities will allow for ramp up of production from the current gross 9,000 barrels of oil per day to 40,000 barrels per day of gross production. Additionally, construction of a fifth gas processing train at our Salam gas plant is expected to commence by year end.</p>
          <p>With this very active development and production infrastructure program, we expect 2010 to be another year of robust production growth for Apache's international regions. And the many ongoing projects represent significant sources of new production that will come on stream between 2011 and 2015.</p>
          <p>In international exploration we expect to run an average of 10 rigs during 2010 and expect to drill 76 gross and 61 net wells. 39 of these wells will be in Egypt where we will benefit from a decade long consistent new field discovery rate that allows us to bring on production very quickly due to our wide operational reach across the western desert.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we are focusing our exploration drilling on the oil and rich gas condensate prospects of the AEB and Jurassic formations in our concessions covering four western desert areas: the Faghur Basin, including the Phiops NEAG areas, the Matruh structure trend, the Abu Gharadig Basin, and the Beneswift Basin.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are setting up future exploration drilling programs with the planned acquisition of 3,000 square kilometers of new 3D seismic and five surveys covering ten of our concessions, a 70% increase to our 3D acquisitions over 2009. Our proprietary 3D coverage of the Western Desert now exceeds 30,000 square kilometers.</p>
          <p>In Australia we expect to drill 19 exploration wells, focusing on our significant offshore acreage holdings in the Carnarvon Basin of the Northwest Shelf. The program will be principally focused on new prospects in the Julimar field trend in support of our Wheatstone LNG project participation and the Varanus Island, Halyard, Harriet and Macedon areas in support of our domestic gas supply projects. Additionally, we expect to acquire 1,400 square kilometers of 3D seismic and five surveys, including a benchmark Forties survey in the Coniston Van Gogh field areas.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, while we did not drill any exploration wells last year, as we focused on building what is a very interesting portfolio of diverse plays across the country, our 10 well exploration drilling program this year will target impacted prospects for Pre-Cuyo, Cuyo, and Springhill reservoirs in each of the Neuqu&#xE9;n, Cuyo, and Austral Basins.</p>
          <p>In North Sea we will resume exploration drilling near the Forties Field complex with three wells after two years of primary focus on development drilling.</p>
          <p>To summarize our international exploration program for 2010, we will be conducting an impactive exploration drilling program across our core areas that will target an aggregate of nearly 290 million barrels of oil equivalent of risk mean net reserves. We will acquire 5,500 square kilometers of proprietary 3D seismic in support of future exploration and development activities and we will progress key infrastructure projects in Egypt, Australia and the North Sea to provide for continued production growth in 2010 and future years.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Roger.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Rod, and good afternoon everyone. What a year, a tale of two cycles; financial Armageddon followed by a recovery that surprised virtually everyone in its strength. What started out as a downright scary year ended with $1.9 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.59 a share for the year. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings more than doubled to $664 million or $1.96 per share from the fourth quarter of '08. And they were the strongest earnings of the year. Who would have thought it?</p>
          <p>Cash from operations were just shy of $5 billion for the year and over $1.4 billion for the quarter. Compared to our initial plan, the year's cash flow was 36% or $1.3 billion higher, enabling us to increase to drilling capital by $350 million and acquire $300 million of properties while still living within cash flow.</p>
          <p>Our 9% production growth despite 40% less capital speaks to the benefit of our long term approach. Clearly this growth could not have been achieved if not for first production from a number of significant long term development projects.</p>
          <p>Exploration success continues to add to our pipeline of development projects, providing growth visibility that can really move the needle once brought online. Despite higher production and substantially reduced capital, Apache added 216 million barrels of oil equivalent through drilling and acquisitions, outpacing production of 213 million barrels of oil equivalent at a cost of $3.5 billion. These additions were added at $16 per barrel of oil equivalent and were quite economic as some 40% of our additions were oil. At $70 a barrel, oil sells at 14 times the price of gas, leaving plenty of profit margin.</p>
          <p>This growing disparity between the value of oil and gas underscores Apache's advantageous product mix. Oil and NGLs comprised half of our production, but 72% of our 2009 revenue. You know, we talk a lot about our balanced production mix, but I think it's often lost just how valuable oil really is to us. Our 50/50 production mix generated last year, $8.6 billion in revenue. To get the same revenue if we were all gas, we would have had to produce 2.3 Tcf, or twice what we actually produced.</p>
          <p>The point is our oil production is incredibly valuable to us. Our international gas also held up quite well because it's not tied to volatile North American spot prices. In fact, while North American realizations declined by half in '09, our international gas price dropped less than 20%. Coupled with 25% production growth, our international gas revenue actually climbed 5% to $770 million. Prospects are excellent for our international gas revenue to continue to grow as once stranded gas rises toward world prices.</p>
          <p>With international contributing 51% of our total production, Apache's the leading independent international producer in our peer group and we think that gives us a competitive advantage, both in terms of finding more oil in the future and benefiting from rising international gas prices.</p>
          <p>Finally in 2009, against our number one priority to live within cash flow, Apache ended in the year with just over $2 billion of cash on the books versus just under 2 billion in 2008. I would note that this was accomplished without having to issue equity at or near the bottom of the market.</p>
          <p>That having been said, the real question is. What's next? Now that the world economy is no longer dangling so close to the precipice of financial ruin, we're going to step it up a notch. We plan to increase E&amp;P capital by about half, to six or $6.5 billion dollars which we figure roughly approximates 2010 cash flow, assuming prices of around $70 a barrel and $5 per Mcf. As usual, Apache will reassess our capital budget on a quarterly basis and adapt accordingly.</p>
          <p>Capital spending including for GTP facilities and C&amp;A is forecasted to be split evenly between North America and International. The significant increases in 2010 are in drilling, as activity ramps up to more typical levels and in facilities with our large projects progressing in Australia, Egypt, North Sea and Canada. The largest increases will occur in the U.S. after splitting our Central Region and in Canada and Australia.</p>
          <p>You can find capital spending details by country on our website under the Supplemental Financial Data section that Tom mentioned. Given our increased budget for 2010, we currently have hedged approximately 40% of our year end North American gas production. 225,000 MMBtu per day is hedged with swaps averaging around $5.80 and 84,000 MMBtu per day is hedged using collars with average floors and ceilings of around $5.50 and $7. We've also hedged 150,000 gigajoules per day of our Canadian gas production with swaps at an average of around $5.35 in Canadian dollars at AECO.</p>
          <p>On the oil side, we haven't been quite as aggressive. We have hedged just over 10% of our worldwide liquids for an average of 35,000 barrels per day for 2010. Approximately 80% represent collars with average floors and ceilings approximating $55 and $81 a barrel. The balance is swapped at an average price of just under $69 a barrel.</p>
          <p>We're also actively screening acquisition opportunities. And while we are not in hot pursuit at the moment, it is apparent that our industries' acquisition pipeline is thawing. In addition to our $2 billion of cash, $2.3 billion of undrawn credit lines leave us a combined $4.3 billion of firepower. This and a low 24% debt-to-cap provide considerable flexibility to act on either incremental drilling or acquisitions should attractive opportunities materialize.</p>
          <p>With respect to costs, we currently forecast slightly higher cash costs including taxes other than income, but I will tell you our goal is to keep them flat with 2009's average of around $11.25 per BOE.</p>
          <p>With a strong financial position, solid oil prices, international gas prices trending higher, and projected production growth of five to 10%, the current outlook for 2010 is quite favorable. Steve?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roger. I'd like to close by summarizing what I think are the three main messages of all the information that all the gentlemen have shared today. The first is 2009 was a good year for Apache. We had strong growth in a challenging environment with restricted capital and well count. We really owe this to the performance and hard work of our team and their focus on generating growth and value.</p>
          <p>The second message Roger just mentioned is that we expect to have five to 10% net production growth in 2010. And I might add in addition, our development drilling program will deliver 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the first full year of its contribution in 2011.</p>
          <p>And third, we built a well-balanced global portfolio of growth areas for the long term. The diversity of our 2010 operating plans outlined by John and Rod, I think reflect that. So 2010 is going to be a very busy year for Apache. And with the organization and opportunity set, there is much more in front of us in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>So before we go back to work, we'd be ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Bob Morris of Citi.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question looking at your finding development cost and reserve replacement by region. And what's interesting is Canada was by far the best region in terms of both reserve replacement and finding costs even after revisions. And that's been a challenging region for other companies up there. Was the strong extension and discoveries that you booked in Canada the result of a lot of PUDs being booked at Horn River or what drove that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might open it up. Horn River is our big play. We had some PUD drilling locations that we drilled this year. And basically we have one year of drilling, a pad drilling program for 2010 PUD-ded up. But we really didn't change the way we looked at our business. If you look at our overall portfolio our PUDs are up 3% year over year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So most of the extensions and discoveries you booked in Canada were PUDs at Horn River?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be correct. But the real point we're making there is that we haven't really got ahead of this thing. We're really just PUD-ing up the next year's drilling program, basically an extra pad alongside the pads we've already drilled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question was the revisions that you recorded in Egypt, were those all associated with the PSC contracts essentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, those all priced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I know you had a great year in Egypt with all the exploratory drilling success. The oil price that you did those adjustments on that the PSC contract was based looked like about $63 a barrel, yet your finding and development costs in Egypt was over $31 a barrel. And I just wanted to get your comments on economics of that, because I would have expected perhaps a lower finding and development cost at that oil price given the success that you had in Egypt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Rod chime in a little bit, but I will tell you what happened. Because of the oil price, you get a real &#x2013; when you say what we booked, what we booked is the same thing that's happened to us on the revision side, frankly, because you have to run that through the PSC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we had $40 a barrel, your finding cost probably would have been a third what they are today. And it really is a very economic place because what happens is, is that you get all your costs back in four years. So you've got to be real careful whether we show really good finding costs or we show really high finding costs in Egypt. That if you run it on one price or you looked at it on a gross oil basis, it would be much better off if you understand what I'm saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Because I was looking at $63 per barrel was the price you had to base your bookings in PSC on and the finding cost is running at about a little over 50% of that oil price, which is the basis for your bookings, which I would have expected the finding costs to be maybe a third of what oil price basis was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but see the problem is your reserves. And I'm sure Tom can answer this. You run your reserves through the total PSC to come up with what your extensions are. Just like your base so it affects not only your reserve revisions, but it also affects the amount of reserves you book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. I'll follow up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The timing difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I'm sorry, did you say someone else was going to comment on that in addition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just said it's a timing difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Rod. The only thing I would add to that. Is that you have to take into account the cost recovery mechanism of the PSCs, in that you have a large balance of costs are constantly rolling toward. It's a big difference on one quarter to the next, or one year to the next, depending on how much money is in that pool from your prior year's spending. And additionally, the cost recovery Steve mentioned with regard to capital expenses over 16 financial quarters. Your operating expenses however are recovered over four financial quarters, or one year. So it's a complex mechanism, because of the PSCs. Basically when prices are up, we lose revenue interest on our share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when prices are down, we benefit the opposite direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. I'll follow up. That's helpful. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Permian Basin, especially since you're now going to be designating it as a new unit. Can you talk about the materiality of your program for this year? And whether that's an area that you expect to grow solely organically or whether that's an area you look for additional mid to larger acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, I think that's one of those places we'd like to do both in. We've got a number of interesting exploration ideas that we will be trying over the next year. But it's certainly an area we'd like to grow by acquisition as well. It's been good to us. We've got a good operating group responsible for it, and we think we can grow that region for years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what do you expect to be your contribution from this year's program, similar to how you were presenting the contribution to year end or 2011 &#x2013; barrels a day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll probably have to get back with you, Brian, on &#x2013; I didn't break that out here. But you can imagine the primary program out there that we outlined for you was infill development programs. So I would expect any activity we get out of exploration won't be showing up really until 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just looking at you capital program, which I think you mentioned was kind of based on $70 oil and $5 gas. If oil prices do end up averaging 75, 80, 85, would you look to increase that capital budget and where would be your priorities, oil, gas, regionally for incremental spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think our mantra is we'd like to stay around our cash flow. And if we see, just like this year, frankly, Brian, we spent more money than we started out &#x2013; I think we started out at 3.5 billion and we ended up spending I think 4.1 billion or thereabouts.</p>
          <p>If we see higher oil prices and higher revenues, net cash flow, we'll spend more money. And that probably will come in several regions. Australia's pretty well set, just because of the rig activity and &#x2013; but we certainly could spend more money in North America in the Central Region. We could spend more money in the Gulf of Mexico. We could &#x2013; actually we could spend more money in each one of those regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. If I can just ask one last quick one. When should we expect or what should the timing &#x2013; what timing are you looking at for selling any off-take for Wheatstone gas contracts?</p>

          <p>Just a question on reserves again. In terms of your &#x2013; and again on revisions. On your total revisions, and I know it's complicated somewhat by the Egypt production sharing contract, but your total revisions, what was the percentage of proved developed revisions and the percentage of PUD revisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have our Vice President &#x2013; Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering here. We're going to have to get back with you on that. All of the revisions were price, and I would imagine a big chunk of them were proved developed. But that's a guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll follow up. And then in terms of the acquisitions you made, reserve acquisitions, proved reserve acquisitions, it was mostly in the U.S. and was that mostly PUDs or proved developed, do you have a number there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of the reserves acquisitions you made in 2009, you bought some reserves, I think it was mostly in the U.S. Was it mostly proved developed or PUDs?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thanks, good afternoon everybody. I have a couple of things I wanted to go through. Jumping back to Egypt, your production obviously is bumping up pretty close to your 2X target that you set a few years back. Can you talk a little bit about, with the ramp up in exploration drilling with the Salam 5 plant, just generally in terms of the overall prospectivity of the Western Desert, particularly on the oil side? Just where exactly do you see the production potential moving over the next few years?</p>

          <p>As you know, the numbers we put out for 2010, we're looking at a program drilling &#x2013; wildcat drilling program that's back to our, if you will "normal levels" which runs around 30 wells a year. So it's about a 30% increase over &#x2013; or a 50% increase over what we had in 2008 &#x2013; 2009, I'm sorry. Even though we completed our Salam Gas Trains 3 and 4 last summer, with continued drilling successes through 2009, we again find ourselves in a situation with the need to add more processing capacity to the Western Desert by building this fifth Salam Gas Train, which we intend to initiate construction by year end, as I indicated.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of gas behind pipe as well as oil, and these are mainly condensate rich gas zones yet to be produced, so it's a matter of when you want to get it out. We can live with the current facilities and stretch it out over many, many years, but we have a lot of near-term opportunities to increase the net present value of that gas by producing it sooner as opposed to later. Of course the government of Egypt is very interested in adding more processing capacity to accommodate the additional production because of the almost insatiable gas demand in the country of Egypt, which continues to grow about 11 or 12% annually.</p>
          <p>So we have a very robust inventory of prospects. We're drilling about 175 to 200 wells a year. And the exploration prospects continue to spawn additional development drilling year by year. This has been a consistent pattern for the last decade. We've been drilling now some 16 or 1,700 wells in the country and our success rate on exploration development is very consistent year on year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could press you just a little bit more on that, if you don't mind. What I'm really looking at here is you're going to drill 30-plus exploration wells this year. If you could talk to the backlog of &#x2013; what have you actually got in Egypt in terms of longer term potential? It seems to be a lot more oily as you guys have talked about and I think a lot of geological data, it's a lot cooler on the western side of the desert. So it looks like you've got a lot of oil prospectivity there. I guess that if you can overlay on that, what is the horizontal drilling potential in that region? And ultimately what &#x2013; I guess you're going to have to reset your 2X target at some point because you're getting pretty close. So I'm really trying to get a feel for, is that incremental production going to be oil? And if so, what do you really see as the potential of this area let's say on another three to five-year target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the first part of your question with regard to the oil prospectivity, what we've observed is our recent drilling programs, moving westward toward the Libyan border in the Faghur Basin area, west of our main call it property base, is that things appear to be more oily there. Perhaps it's because it's cooler from a geological sense, but clearly the wells we're making there are oil wells and they are oil wells that are deeper than you normally see in that part of the desert.</p>
          <p>Our backlog of our inventory, we look at continually evaluating and assessing prospects that are developed off of our very large 3D seismic inventory. And in fact, we've been reshooting some of the areas in our main producing area that we shot a decade ago, and the data quality now is amazing and turning up even more and more ideas.</p>
          <p>Whether it's on exploration projects or production enhancement projects and workovers, every year we have this inventory of maybe like 300 production enhancement projects, and then we do the jobs. The next year we still have 300 production enhancement projects to do. The work continues to spawn other ideas and other work, whether that's on the exploration side through exploration drilling, or the development of production enhancement activity.</p>
          <p>Now as far as horizontal applications, activities for horizontal exploitation in Egypt are really not even touched. And we are beginning to investigate through horizontal drilling certain formations, certain reservoir sequences that we think could be applicable to such. And like many times these things have been done for years in North America and they're just now arriving onshore in Egypt. There are no known horizontal plays operating in the country at present but we're looking to see what we can do in that area from what we know from North America activity.</p>

          <p>Great stuff. I guess I'm not going to get the answer on the three to five year production target, so maybe I'll take that one offline.</p>
          <p>The only other one I have is moving to North America, if I could throw one at John. I hope I'm not touching on any sensitivities here, but the Horn River is obviously one thing but you guys have been pretty active right next door in the Liard. I'm just wondering if you can give us any update on your activities, on your plans, on what you've seen so far, on how that has played into your decision perhaps to get involved in Kitimat?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way I'm going to answer that is, is that we're buying a lot of acreage in a lot of different places in the world, and Canada happens to be one of them. That's pretty much what we're going to &#x2013; what our position is going be there.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, a couple questions. Roger, let me start with, you mentioned at five and 70 that you'd be generating, do you say you're going to generate 6 to 6.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me ask this, let me ask it another way. If I'm looking at forward guidance, if I just look at margins to generate 6 million at five and 70, you mentioned LOE is flat. Are there any other changes as far as any other components that are moving significantly because it seems like that implies a higher margin for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what your tax rate is but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because that flat that I mentioned excludes taxes other than income, and so when oil goes up, we get hit in the North Sea with a high PRT, so that probably works a little bit against what you're saying. But in general, you're probably on track. Does that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it just seems like your cost structure is coming down a little more next year, ex any impact of taxes. Is that accurate on a per-unit basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our cash costs per unit probably are going to be about &#x2013; as I indicated, we're going to target having it flat excluding the PRT and other taxes other than income. So we're going to have more production. We probably see a little higher cost, but when you spread it out over more production BOE, it will be up. If we hit our target, it will be flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that gives me some color. Second question, you talked about the Permian Basin. Have you guys started doing any horizontal work down there yet? Is there anything on that front as far as attempting to apply that technology down in the Permian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have. As Rod indicated on his work in Egypt, we're also doing the same thing in the Permian Basin, picking out targets and doing some of that drilling. We actually have a horizontal well being completed as we speak in our Shafter Lake unit. So that will be a fairly active play for us down in the Permian this year because we really want to see what kind of potential we have in the large acreage base we have down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's just going to be an ongoing program throughout the year. We may hear something later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I do too. And then a final question, in Egypt, as you move west, is there any &#x2013; I know you announced an agreement today. But as I think about historical Apache to the Western Desert and some of the oil exploration, is there any difference in the cost recovery mechanisms or anything you can share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost recovery mechanisms of course can vary from concession to concession because each is an individual law. However, for Apache's concessions, the 22 concessions we have, the variance between the concessions is very, very small.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no shared excess cost recovery in Quarun and at North El Diyur a very tiny concession. All the rest of them have shared excess and very favorable fiscal terms in terms of the profit splits.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Renewal terms, the two that we just renewed, very importantly the Khalda Offset. That was a seven-year extension that we had approved by the government. East Bahariya was a three year extension. Khalda Offset is very important to us because it's the home of one of our bread and butter operations historically. And this will be a &#x2013; unlike a typical exploration concession that you'd be granted in the country, there is no relinquishment associated with the seven years. It's a the block seven-year term to do all that work.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just had one quick question. You're obviously ramping up your capital program a lot. I was really wondering how much of your rig cost and service cost have you got locked in going into 2010, particularly, I guess in the U.S. onshore business given the scarcity of horizontal rigs right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John can answer that. I think there's very little right now. Perhaps the only place that may not be that way is in the Gulf of Mexico where we usually take a longer view of our jack-up rigs. But certainly the land rigs in the U.S., we still believe they're going to be flat because the vast majority of things that are drilled in the United States today are still gas. I think gas was down $0.23 today. So I doubt if you see a real surge in rig rates here at $5.12 gas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, guys. Just a question on the Granite Wash, given your vertical well control, can you give some color on the variability in reservoir properties across the play both laterally and within the major productive horizons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know how much color I can give you, but you called on a key point there. Clearly across the entire Granite Wash play, there's a variety of numbers of sands available for development and different yields we would expect out of those. So we obviously have a pretty good feel for what we'd see in some of the areas that we've been drilling for years out there and so we're concentrating on those areas that first of all would have the highest liquid yields. With that said, we're going be a doing a lot of work around really trying to assess our entire position out there over this year. So you should expect us to be very active in that Granite Wash play across our entire acreage position this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've talked &#x2013; we've heard about the Marmaton and the Atoka, but what are the other intervals that you guys will be pursuing in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have Marmaton, Atoka. We'll have &#x2013; we talk a lot about the Granite Wash A/B. We talked about the Caldwell. We have a variety of them that we'll be testing this year. And really, the interesting piece for going forward on this play in my opinion is getting to the point where we would actually get where we can do multilaterals and develop more than one of these intervals in the same well bore. So we'll be trying that concept out too, but I think that's where the future is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you guys are going to try a multilateral in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Switching over to the Horn River, have you tested both the Muskwa and the Klua intervals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have. On our present &#x2013; we have one well completed and &#x2013; we actually have two wells completed in Klua. The first one was a vertical well, but we have one horizontal well completed in Klua from 2008. However, we were somewhat compromised on the frac jobs. We got on it and we only got four frac jobs out of it. It is about half as thick as the Muskwa, so we won't spend as much time on that because if you've got a certain number of rigs running, you're going to go after your bigger targets first. But I will tell you we've got two wells on the 16-well 70-K pad that we are completing right now. Two Klua wells are in that mix. So we'll know a lot more about the Klua by the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then since you've had some run time on &#x2013; I know it's just a select few wells, but have your spacing assumptions changed any now that you have some production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I was talking about experimenting some more out there. We've got a lot of activity going on. The pad we're drilling presently, our 52-L pad, we've actually spaced &#x2013; we've brought the spacing between individual laterals out to two different widths. We've added about 80 meters to one side of the pad and about 50 meters to the other side of the pad.</p>
          <p>The real key out here is we've got literally 200 pads worth of potential at 15 &#x2013; 16 wells per pad; and so far we've got four of these developed. So we're trying to get the right answers on the big picture. We've got a lot of activity to go. In a perfect world, you would get your spacing between horizontal well bores out further and put more fracs in the individual laterals. And that's what you'll see us doing a lot more of this year, up to 20 fracs on an individual lateral.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering, obviously given cash on the balance sheet, liquidity, et cetera, we've been talking about expansion of CapEx and property acquisitions, things of that nature. That said, I'm curious are there existing properties or plays at this point that unless they reach critical mass or would demonstrate superior economics compared to some of your other opportunities, that may be potential candidates for divestitures as you optimize your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not a very good seller. It's hard enough to find.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean clearly, they're cheering, I guess. So I guess we should simply watch where the capital dollars go in order to assess that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly do. I'm always jaded by &#x2013; we bought some things over &#x2013; from Exxon over the number of years and it's always been a cat fight. The gentleman that used to be pretty influential in Exxon used to tell me Steve, we were arguing about 40 acres. He said, Steve, 40 acres is a lot, because it's hard to come by. So we have a little bit. Not that we're anywhere near the quality and size of Exxon, but we have a little bit of the same.</p>
          <p>And the reason is frankly, if you look across our portfolio, and I'll give you a for example, let's take Nevis, it was a little shallow gas play, and all of the sudden we drilled CBM wells on it. I think we probably still are producing 80 to 90 million a day out of the coalbed methane at Nevis that we really didn't see.</p>
          <p>We're talking an awful lot about Granite Wash. We probably got Granite Wash 500 wells. We drilled our first Granite Wash probably in the 50s. And we're getting to ready to come through there with a horizontal play that we have HBP of 200,000 acres.</p>
          <p>Or if you look at some of the things we're doing in west Texas, horizontal wells in old waterfloods and all of a sudden you are able to increase production. Owning acreage in real well known hydrocarbon areas really give you an advantage, especially if you're large, which is why you see us in large positions in most places that we're in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even if you look at Horn River, Ootla that grew up under a marginal play for us. We added a lot of acreage but it really started with ratty old acreage that we hadn't sold.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of optionality in some of that old stuff that doesn't look very attractive. It's a hard thing to sort through, because it goes up in cost and you wonder why you're holding onto it. And then every now and then you find something underneath it that makes it more than worthwhile.</p>

          <p>Okay and one last question. In the past when we looked at potential basis differentials and realizations in North American natural gas, the Rockies in the past historically was particularly disadvantaged obviously with pipeline takeaways and access to the eastern markets. Much of that's been alleviated, but as the Marcellus comes on to become a very significant material producer in the next three to four years, and you assess your North American natural gas portfolio, are there places where you're concerned about basis differential or simply crowding out of supply that's closer to market than you may be? And how you might be thinking about potentially addressing those concerns going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; it's, honestly it's a very good macro question. Because as these shale plays have come through, there is absolutely no doubt that you're going to change the dynamics in North American gas. Now what the end result of that is, I'm not real sure because it has a lot to do with pipelines, et cetera. But there's no doubt that Marcellus is in a favorable position.</p>
          <p>We've seen that frankly a little bit in the Gulf Coast with the Haynesville gas going across. It's fascinating to me that depending on the price, you get basis differentials in Canada from $1.30 and it's probably as low as it's been right now than it has been in a long time and you ask yourself why. I'm not sure, but I think it is generally &#x2013; and we don't have an answer for it frankly right at the moment. But trust me we are very cognizant of that. But I don't know what the drivers are going be other than closeness to the market.</p>

          <p>And we got to keep our costs down. And that's one advantage that Horn River play has ultimately. It stacks up very well geologically and that ought to be able to enable us to get our costs down and therefore suffer a bit more of a transportation and distance differential.</p>

          <p>Hey guys, good afternoon.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question. Back to the Investor Conference in 2008 you guys talked quite a bit about your Eagle Ford position, how you tested some oil over there. Has there been any further testing in that? I think you even mentioned looking to the gas window a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going to do a little more testing this year. I will tell you it's a difficult area technically. Having said that, so was the Barnett Shale at one time, back when it was making 300 Mcfs a day and frankly Devon had the foresight to go out there and buy it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitchell that is, but there will be a time and I really believe this and I don't know when that is, from a technology standpoint, the Eagle Ford, the important thing about it is, it's got some of the highest per acre oil in place of any shale play in the United States.</p>
          <p>So and the important thing about that is, we've got about 450,000 acres that held by production. So we can &#x2013; like most of our acreage, one of the reasons you don't see us as trend setters a lot in North America is most of our acreage is held by production, so we can let people do an awful lot of experimenting before we turn the technology turn. Same reason we're starting to get into west Texas, now there's been a lot of horizontal wells. You can look on a map. You can see that. But we have a tremendous acreage position out there that now allows us to go out there and really start exploiting our base property.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. But I guess the early wells you had talked about have all been in the oil window, I thought you had mentioned at some point trying some of the gas windows. Has that been done or is that part of the testing this year?</p>

          <p>Well, I mean, I hate to say it this way, but I think we got lots of gas.</p>
