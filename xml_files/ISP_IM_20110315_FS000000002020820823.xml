          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the conference call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the presentation of 2010 results, hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera, Chief Executive Officer. My name is Clara (00:15), and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Corrado Passera. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome to everybody, and thank you for joining us to discus our 2010 results. This will be the last set of results before we launch our new business plan. So if you permit me, I will focus today on the 2010 results, and I will leave the discussion on strategy outlook options for the future to the presentation we will have in a few weeks' time.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation, we are announcing a set of sound, in our opinion, solid numbers, especially if we consider them in the light of the scenario in which we work, and if we take into account all the elements that have affected the management of real economy banks, the way we call ourselves, commercial banks. We believe that we have reached and passed the bottom of the interest rate cycle, and certainly our retail activity has paid the cost for such a low bottom in terms of market yields. And we believe we've paid the cost of the sovereign risk crisis that has hit Europe.</p>
          <p>Despite such difficult situations, our results confirm what we had in mind, and our approach, we used to call it sustainable profitability has been confirmed. By sustainable profitability, I mean the combination, and the balanced optimization of profitably on the one side, but at the same time liquidity that is very important, and where we have quite a strong position, solidity and low risk profile.</p>
          <p>So let's move to the presentation. Page number three is the summary of the summary. It starts with this concept of sustainable profitability that we have confirmed despite market rate at historical lows. Probably we will not see what we have seen in the first part of the year anymore. And they are the tensions I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Our net income is at &#x20AC;2.7 billion, &#x20AC;2.8 billion last year. The &#x20AC;200 million we expected from the sale of branches to Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole will be accounted only in 2011, and this piece of the results is missing in 2010 results.</p>
          <p>If you look at the net income adjusted for the main non-recurring items, more or less we are in line with the previous year, &#x20AC;2.3 billion despite the more difficult rate environment. So this was the first point. Second point dividend payout; as announced on several occasions, we confirm the &#x20AC;1 billion we accrued during the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of loan activity, we will see the figures, but quarter after quarter, we eventually see a low, but consistent growth in good loan demand that had been missing for more than a year in 2008 and 2009. At the same time, given our approach and given our strong prudence in terms of credit risk, the cost of credit has gone a bit down, even a little bit more than we expected in 2010 vis-&#xE0;-vis versus 2009.</p>
          <p>Cost reduction has been confirmed, and for the fourth consecutive year, we have a minus sign on this element of our P&amp;L. Liquidity remains very high. Our funding capability has been confirmed also in the first two months of this year, and low leverage remain a competitive advantage of ours.</p>
          <p>In terms of solidity, and in terms of capital ratios, we closed the year with Core Tier 1 at 8.1% that is above the 7% Basel 3 requirements already today.</p>
          <p>Page four, the point I was making before; our profitability in 2010 has been confirmed on an adjusted basis, so we are exactly at the same level. If we exclude for a second, profits on trading that by themselves are volatile, the more industrial solid part of the result is up 31%.</p>
          <p>Page number five, the proposition we will make to our shareholders in terms of dividend payout &#x20AC;0.08 on ordinary shares and &#x20AC;0.091 on savings shares. That correspond to 3.4% yield on ordinary shares and 4.5% yield on savings shares.</p>
          <p>Page six, our customer loan growth. As I said before, we're talking about low, but consistent growth rates. The whole year is &#x2013; the end of the year is above the end of last year, and what sounds an interesting sign is the SME's results in terms of loans in the last quarter. The fact that we have a 1.8% increase with SMEs in the fourth quarter versus the third is, in our opinion, a good sign of the recovery that is underway in our country.</p>
          <p>Page seven, on the left hand side, you have the net inflow of new non-performing loans. That means whatever is not performing, the past dues, the substandard, the doubtful, the restructured, all of them have a clear trend downward in terms of new addition quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the right hand side, the red line is the cost of credit, and as planned, we have gone down versus last year from 99 basis points to 82 basis points. And the total net inflow of new non-performing loans in the year has gone down from &#x20AC;12.9 billion to &#x20AC;5.7 billion. I will give you more details on them afterwards when we elaborate line by line. But what we keep confirming is the solidity of our reserve on performing loans. We have not used it. We have increased it actually during the year. And the coverage, the total coverage of our doubtful loan is at a very comfortable 123%.</p>
          <p>Page number eight, that's the other side of the balance sheet. We were looking at loans before and now we look at deposits and financial assets belonging to our customers. In a very competitive year, the total customer financial assets on our accounts have increased. And what is even more important, the assets under management, the total assets under management have gone to &#x20AC;233 billion. We will give you more details on that later.</p>
          <p>Page nine, the cost page for the year with a minus sign. We are proud of that. We believe it is what we had to do to realize all the synergies coming from the merger and you have the synergies on that right hand side. We are heading toward the &#x20AC;2 billion worth of synergies. And at the same time, these synergies compensated for the lack &#x2013; the partial &#x2013; the lack &#x2013; partially the lack of revenues on the income side.</p>
          <p>Page 10, liquidity. Liquidity is and will remain one of our key competitive advantages. You'll see that we keep balancing loan to customers and direct customer deposits &#x20AC;402 billion versus &#x20AC;379 billion. As you see on the right hand side, we have made the analysis, the breakdown between retail deposits and wholesale deposits. Almost &#x20AC;300 billion come from retail customers and that make the total customer base &#x2013; cost per customer deposit base even stronger.</p>
          <p>You should add to this a comfortable situation. Therefore, the &#x20AC;54 billion of eligible assets we have with Central Banks, we never used this money, these securities during the year. And the last element you should be aware of, we have replaced in the last part of the year some more expensive institutional clients that direct deposit with less expensive interbank funding, but never any recourse to the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p>Another analysis on page 11 gives you a synthetic picture of the liquidity policy we have followed in the last three years. For each year 2008, 2009, 2010, you see the maturities on the left hand side and the funding we have realized. We expected difficult times and we over funded, we said it very explicitly on a number of occasions, we over funded the bank both in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we did what was useful for the bank. And in 2011, we have now almost covered 50% of our needs in the first two months of the year. Next year will be a much easier year. 2011 will be the last one with high level of maturities coming. But we feel the wholesale market is responding according to our expectations. And in any case, the reserve we have through our retail network is certainly more than effective.</p>
          <p>Page 12, the usual comparison we make with our peers in terms of leverage, by leverage, we mean tangible net shareholders' equity on tangible total assets. And we remain, as we want to remain, at the very top of the ranking. This is another competitive advantage, if you want, on or you can even consider that sort of reserve in case we want to reduce a little bit this very rigid policy.</p>
          <p>Page 13, the capital ratios perspective. Core Tier 1 at 8.1%, the 8.1% is the 7.9% accounting figure plus the effect of things that have already been &#x2013; that let's say the deals that are already in the final stage, things that have already been subscribed and that can be taken into account both divestments and investments. The increases are from 7.1% to 8.1%, but also to 7.9%. It's a strong increase we have realized during the year.</p>
          <p>And as I said before it is already in line with Basel 3, not only with obviously with Basel 2. Tier 1 ratio at 9.6% from 8.4% and total capital ratios to 13.4% versus less than 12% at the end of 2009. Obviously, these figures already take into account the dividends I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Page 14, we immediately started giving the market our best estimate of the Basel 3 implication and the effects on our ratios. During the last few months a number of new rules have been introduced. The total impact on us is more or less even. The fact that we have now 100 basis points instead of the 70 basis points we had at the end of September is because we have already enjoyed and we have already included the positive effect of the internal model that have been validated by the Bank of Italy. So it's totally consistent with the figures we gave you a few months ago.</p>
          <p>Page 16, we can go through it rapidly. Page 17, the summary of our P&amp;L, the quarterly P&amp;L. The two arrows are signaling the good increase in the net fee and commission. I will elaborate better on all the other lines. Operating revenues, up 3.1%, the costs have the usual seasonal effect as you know. But if we compare the 10.4% increase is actually is 2.1% lower in absolute terms vis-&#xE0;-vis last quarter 2009, same seasonal effect as expected on net adjustments to loans, but the total loan &#x2013; the total provisions in fourth quarter 2010 are 21% lower than what we had in 2009. And the combination of all these effects come to an income before tax that shows a minus sign 12.7%, but a plus sign if we compare the quarter, the last quarter 2010 with the last quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 18 is the usual analysis we give to exclude the main non-recurring items from the net income, and I don't go through the details, but you have all of them, if you need them.</p>
          <p>Page 19, is the P&amp;L, the total year P&amp;L, more or less I will say very much in line with what we expected. The two components of the revenues that have performed better than expected are the net fee and commission income and income from insurance business, cost have performed better than we expected.</p>
          <p>We are at minus 10% in terms of operating margin, minus 10% in terms of income before tax. Certainly the trend in provisions has been a little bit better than what we expected. And then, thanks to what we enjoyed in terms of extraordinary items in the last, but one line, we are more or less in line with 2009. As I said before, we do not have the &#x20AC;200 million effect more or less of the Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole branches. We had a little bit higher than expected positive effect in the fair value evaluation of our insurance company, but we have accrued &#x2013; we have a provision with a good part of it in terms of further provisions on risk and charges just a short of reserve.</p>
          <p>Page 20, all the non-recurring items at an annual level. If you include all these non-recurring items, the results, the net income adjusted between 2009 and 2010 are more or less at the same level. And as I said before, if you exclude also profits on trading, the performance of 2010 has been certainly higher than the one in 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 21, let's say the balance sheet main items. Loans to customers plus customer financial asset plus all the components of the customer financial asset move in the same direction, positive direction, while the risk-weighted asset, also thanks to a number of mitigation, the mechanism and activities we have introduced, is down 8.2%.</p>
          <p>Now, line-by-line, page 22 is the net interest income. The 1.9% decrease in the fourth quarter is mainly due to four elements, reduction in securities portfolio, increased cost of securities, because we have issued Tier 1 &#x2013; and the Tier 1 issue and the effect of this increase in long-term funding is in the round &#x20AC;15 million on the quarterly basis. You always have to remember that the time lag we need to reprice assets when liability cost grows is between three and six months. And certainly, I did this last core line. The &#x2013; our very prudent loan policy puts us in a direct competition with other banks on high-quality customers, and that has certainly a cost.</p>
          <p>If we look at the right hand side of the page, the Euribor, the average Euribor rate has been very, very low, much lower than we expected in our budget exercise. But we believe that the bottom has been reached and also passed.</p>
          <p>If we look at the volumes, page 22 always in the &#x2013; on the right hand side bottom of the page, more or less stable loans with households, SMEs, public finance, positive growth in some international subsidiary banks division, in some banks of the international subsidiary bank division. And as planned, both for loan policy on our side, but especially because of the possibility for large corporate to issue bonds on the market. We have reduced the volumes with very large customers, but the performance of the corporate division proves that we have more than balanced this loss of volumes with other kind of revenues.</p>
          <p>Page 23 is the analysis, both at the quarterly level and at an annual level of the net interest income. If we look at the quarterly analysis, we are glad to see that the operating income impact, that means volumes and spreads with customers has affected positively the results. The hedging, by definition, has to go down when interest rates, market interest rates go up, and the other is the combination of the points I mentioned before, the reduction in the security portfolio of the cost of the Tier 1 issue we made and all the other coverages.</p>
          <p>At an annual level, obviously a big effect came from the sharp decrease in Euribor rates and the elimination of the overdraft charges.</p>
          <p>Page 24, we gave you the breakdown &#x2013; we're giving you the breakdown of our assets in terms of time lag they need to be repriced when we decide to reprice them. 63% of financial assets they need between three and six months but there is at least a third of them that takes more than six months.</p>
          <p>Page 25, good performance in terms of net fee and commission income. The last quarter of 2010 has been the strongest in the last two years. A good part of the increase comes from what we are doing in the area of management dealing, consultancy portfolio management all these kinds of things. And the same positive trend can be seen also at the yearly, at an annual level on the right hand side of the page.</p>
          <p>26, page 26 gives you all the usual elements on our asset management activity. Left hand side, top of the page, the net flows of assets under management in Italy, strong improvement between 2009 and 2010. The net fee and commission income has gone up more than 10%, thanks to both insurance product and portfolio management products, while the mix of mutual funds has improved, and higher value added funds has gone from 24.8% to almost 30%. As we said on other occasions, we have to move this percentage at least to 35%, and this change of mix plus the shift from assets under administration to assets under management is one of the drive for growth we will enjoy in the next years.</p>
          <p>The assets under administration that &#x2013; amount to almost &#x20AC;200 billion and a good percentage of this amount has to be moved to asset under management.</p>
          <p>Page 27, we believe the performance in trading profits has been positive also in this quarter. Obviously it is a volatile business. For sure, we have further reduced the VAR and that is now 15% down to &#x20AC;37 million, so a very low figure. If you look at the following page, the components of trading profits, you see that the main component is the customer line that are &#x2013; the trading profits tightly tied with customer activity.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; for the second quarter in the year, we suffered from unrealized losses on Italian government bonds. When I say unrealized losses, I mean mark-to-market the evaluations that will be recovered with the repayment of these bonds and these bonds are very, very short, very short maturities and by the mid of next year will be repaid. So the average residual life is less than one year.</p>
          <p>Page 29, insurance business. Insurance business is and will &#x2013; is an important component of our P&amp;L. We have this part of the contribution that is the results of the factors but obviously we have also all the commissions we paid to the network. And the fact we succeeded in growing two-digits speed in 2010 is a good evidence of what we can do in the next years.</p>
          <p>I will not elaborate on this because it's part of the business plan presentation. But as I said on a few other occasions in the past, we are eventually &#x2013; we have already been put in the position to consolidate our four companies, and we will now be able to realize all the synergies we had embedded in this activity of ours.</p>
          <p>Page 30, costs, operating costs going down from &#x2013; in any element or in any component of the total cost figure. Personnel expenses down, other administrative expenses down, and the adjustments down at an annual level. The seasonal trend, as you see also in the last year, is the usual but what really matters is the year-on-year consistent reduction.</p>
          <p>Cost of credit, up in the last quarter. In the last quarter, we had two companies that are mentioned in the last note on the left hand side of the page. Neos Finance that is a company of ours and engaged in the consumer credit activity and Centro Leasing that is a company we got from the acquisition of Carifirenze have been re-looked at in terms of provisions, and we decided to have extraordinary provisions in the round of &#x20AC;140 million and &#x20AC;150 million that explain the growth between the third and the fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>On the annual &#x2013; on the yearly analysis, you see that the total cost of credit in terms of basis points is down from 99 basis points to 82 basis points. The total provisions are down from &#x20AC;3.7 million to &#x20AC;3.1 million while in the growth in the &#x2013; between 2009 and 2010 in net provisions for risks and charges you must take into account a &#x20AC;100 million provision that is certainly a prudential one for possible, we call them dispute resolutions.</p>
          <p>Page 32, the substandard loans, both gross and net are going down and in the pipeline of the non-performing loans, this is the most important delicate and difficult to manage kind of component. They are going down quarter-after-quarter. The sign is negative and is consistent a little bit better than what we expected.</p>
          <p>In the total gross non-performing loans and net non-performing loans, you have a figure that is not consistent with our expectation is the past due, but if you take away two positions that that one has already been put back to performing loans and the other one has been put in restructured loans but where we do not expect any loss also past due trend is consistent with the reduction outlook we have and we continue to have.</p>
          <p>Page 33, doubtful loans very well covered and that's the 123% figure we have on the right-hand side. On the other side, we have the performing loan coverage and the total amount of the performing loan reserve, almost &#x20AC;2,500 million.</p>
          <p>We have not used this reserve not even in the worst part of the crisis and not even last year. And what we see in terms of repayments from doubtful loans is very positive. Probably in the last quarter even higher than expected but the fact that we have more than 150% in two-year period in terms of repayment versus a net book value, I believe is an evidence of the good provision policies we have followed.</p>
          <p>Page 34, is simply the details &#x2013; is simply the detail of what I said before, the seasonal effect on doubtful loans and the very consistent trend in the decrease of new substandard loan flow.</p>
          <p>Page 35, the mix of our loan portfolio very well diversify the kind of portfolio both in terms of products and in terms of our industries. You will find also the analysis of the residential mortgage component that is the largest even if it's only 20% and in analyzing this component of the portfolio, you see that the installment income is very low, one-third. The average loan to value is in the round of 50%. So we confirm our prudent credit policy in all areas.</p>
          <p>Page 36 is the exposure by country. As soon as the sovereign risk crisis started, we immediately gave all these informations to the market. And as you can check, as you can see yourself, our overall exposure to the four countries that are under attention, let's say Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, remains in the round of 2% of the total.</p>
          <p>I will not go through the divisional results. Obviously, I am ready to discus all these figures and all the &#x2013; what &#x2013; all the job that has been done last year. As I said before, I will not elaborate further in terms of projects and programs and plans because that will be the agenda for our next meeting in a few weeks' time.</p>
          <p>If we take page 46, we have the summery of what I said at the beginning of the presentation, about the sound performance of our bank in 2010, in terms of sustainable profitability, in terms of recovery in customer loans, in terms of growth in customer financial assets, in terms of confirming high liquidity and low leverage positions, in terms of declining operating cost for the fourth consecutive year, in terms of our asset quality, in terms of cost of credit, in terms of sound capital ratios. I mean, the results, in my opinion, have to be looked altogether, and a combination of all these components of what we consider sustainable profitability are very much in line.</p>
          <p>2011 will be one of the subjects for our next meeting, but we give the general guidance you find on the page, increasing operating income, containment of operating cost, declining cost of credit, growth in recurring profitability. But again, this would be part of the illustration of our next strong solid business plan.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your long attention, now any question, I'm here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. And thanks very much for disclosure. I will stick to questions on numbers, even as you said, outlook you'll discuss more in a few weeks' time. On net interest income, I'd like to understand a little more what has happened and what may happen, especially in the near &#x2013; in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Basically in the impact on NII seems to be deriving from the loss of the contribution from the bond portfolio that you sold. Can you actually tell us a little bit more why did you sold it, what have you sold it, and what you may continue to do, and whether any of this action is actually linked to the way you are actually hedging your &#x2013; using the hedges in your portfolios, just to understand that better?</p>
          <p>Interested also in your comment on loan repricing, which you said especially in good quality loans was very tough in Q4. Do you have any evidence that that is getting better in Q1, or what can you tell us about that?</p>
          <p>Also, looking at the Q1 numbers, thanks very much for the disclosure on how, what is the economic timeline for your repricing on asset and liabilities. Just also bearing in mind that you've done a lot of prefunding in Q1, at present likely have been quite expensive. What is the risk that the Q1 progression of NII again may not be the great, and it may be under pressure because of the general cost of funding? If you could make some comment there?</p>
          <p>And lastly, one question on asset quality, there's been talk recently that interest rates may be starting going up as early as April. If interest rates go up 100 basis points over the next 12 months, have you had any concerns on what this could do to asset quality? I was, for example, looking at your installment on income ratio of 37% on mortgages. How would that increase if interest rates go up 100 basis points? Are you concerned, or not? What is the level of interest rates increase that would make you concerned on this aspect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of net interest income, what happened is what I tried to explain before. The two main elements have been the reduction in the security portfolio that is not continuing, that's sort of a one-time effect, and the &#x20AC;15 million, &#x20AC;20 million &#x2013; the &#x20AC;15 million that comes from the funding you were mentioning.</p>
          <p>So that figure gives you an idea of the effect in terms of increase in the cost of funding. What I want to stress is that, that has to do with the loan repricing too. We are trying and successfully trying for the time being to pass the cost of funding to our customers.</p>
          <p>So the commitment I got from all my colleagues of the different divisions in terms of repricing, in terms of attention and rigidity on the pricing side, I hope that will pay interesting fruits. Hedging policies will remain the same. We are confirming all the hedging facilities we have on our balance sheet and that's another point.</p>
          <p>Last point, asset quality, we are not at all concerned about interest rates increases. We believe that we'll be amongst the banks that will most benefit from an interest rate increase. Given the quality of our loan portfolio, even a 100% increase that is not expected, it might happen, but we do expect, will not have a negative effect in terms of quality, but will have a very positive effect in terms of interest margins. The sensitivity of our interest margin remains very high to interest rates, so to market yield increases.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three very quick questions from me, the first one is on Banca IMI.</p>
          <p>You kindly provided some figures on the profitability of the bank. We are looking at &#x20AC;500 million of net profit. Now on the basis of an allocation of capital of, let's say, 8% of risk-weighted asset the capital is &#x20AC;1.7 billion. And the return on unallocated capital is in the region of 30%, which is indeed a good result. How sustainable are these results? And are you planning to move capital out of other businesses into Banca IMI in order to benefit from this good level of profitability?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the risk-weighted assets which have decreased from &#x20AC;355 billion to &#x20AC;332 billion from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And the &#x20AC;10 billion is a decrease to the adoption of an internal model, but the assets in billion decreased. I am just wondering where this decrease is coming from. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with you. Banca IMI is a hell of a company and is performing in a very interesting way. They will have all the resources that they need to grow even further. If you take page 42 for a second, in the presentation, we're giving for the first time the breakdown of the results of this very effective, very efficient, very talented company of ours. You will see that the operating incomes come obviously for the most parts from capital markets, but investment banking and structured financing also provide important component.</p>
          <p>Total operating income is now in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion, very low cost income. There is room for some investment, very high attention to risk-weighted assets, very low average VAR, even down versus the previous year, and at the end a solid net income in excess of &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>So the answer to your question is, yes, Banca IMI will have the resources they needed to grow with this kind of profile. Practically the decrease of risk-weighted asset in fourth quarter is to a very large extent due to the adoption of the AIRB model.</p>
          <p>For sure, we are working very &#x2013; in a very disciplined way to introduce all the elements, mechanism, guarantees to reduce the use or the waste of capital in all the &#x2013; in all our business lines, and we expect this exercise to give the strongest contribution in 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Buon giorno, Mr. Passera. Just on NII, on page 22 I would just like to understand &#x2013; and 23, your presentation, if I look at the average loans for the year, we have a 5% reduction which actually explains roughly half of the negative fall in NII for the year. So, I was just wondering, I know that you are going to tell us more at the business plan presentation, but because we are starting to see end of period small increases in customer loans, do you think that, in terms of average volumes, 2010 is the last year that average volumes are going to drag net interest income down in addition to spread?</p>
          <p>And also if you could comment where are you in the reduction on your large corporate and mid-corporate portfolio both for capital reason and pricing reason and so on, so that's question number one.</p>
          <p>Just a detail on the net interest income, if I look at your balance sheet, I am looking at page 18 of your press release, you have sold bonds, you explained to us why it decreased. I don't fully understand. And I know that you can have some changes in quarterly evolution, but why your net interbank borrowing position increased to &#x20AC;10 billion roughly in Q4 from an average level of &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion in the previous quarter, considering that you sold bonds, your customer loans are flattish. So if you could tell me what this movement is about?</p>
          <p>And finally a question on asset quality, true you have an improvement in the flows, a watch list and other category. I was just looking at the gross sofferenze. And I looked there is a 25% increase year on year, which is exactly in line with last year, I mean, '09 and '08 versus '10, '09, 26%. But if I look at the net flows, it's &#x20AC;4.1 billion, so yes, asset quality is definitely improving on other categories. What is happening in the sofferenze? Where are you seeing still flows coming, from which category is it? Is it mid-corporate, the SMEs, the large corporate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Several questions, I'm just writing down all of them. Net interest income, the first question, if I remember correctly, is will 2010 be the last year with decreasing volumes. Yes, the answer is yes. We expect it to be the last year and what we have seen recently and consistently goes in this direction.</p>
          <p>The reduction in mid and large corporate lending is to a very large extent due to the issues these companies have been able to do with our support in most cases on the market, and given the behaviors of the market, very much interested in that good industrial &#x2013; solid industrial companies. Those companies &#x2013; those customers of ours have been able to tap the market in a very effective way.</p>
          <p>Liquidity; liquidity, you mentioned a number of components. We explained or we illustrated in the presentation. We decided, as you might remember, to use a little bit more the interbank market given the low cost and availability of that market. We decided to not go beyond a certain level and we are within that level. We decided to get rid of some securities that we considered risky from a rate scenario point of view and we decided to replace some institutional customers' deposit with interbank position because it was much more cost efficient for us.</p>
          <p>Asset quality, as we kept saying in the last quarters, the sofferenze, the doubtful loan will almost automatically continue to grow and that growth is totally embedded and factored in our forecast and in fact, the total cost of non-performing loans is even lower than what we expected. But you must take into account the sort of rule of thumb that at least a percentage of substandard loans, substandard positions become sofferenze, whatever the situation and whatever the scenario is.</p>
          <p>So the figures as of today are in line with our expectations, a bit better also in terms of sofferenze doubtful loans. And we expect the next year to be a little bit &#x2013; certainly to say, better than this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, good afternoon. I have a couple of quick questions. The first one if you could comment on the increase in risk-weighted assets that you estimated under Basel 3 compared to the previous presentation. I think it's about &#x20AC;9.5 billion. Just if you could add some more details exactly as to where that is coming from, and also if you are foreseeing any benefit from the recent ruling on deferred tax assets for Italian banks, just to double check.</p>
          <p>The other one, I mean, regarding your cost of funding, so you mentioned the &#x20AC;69 million that you see that as a one-off, so just to be clear that would be &#x20AC;69 million every quarter sort of stable going forward, just to double check.</p>
          <p>And a very related point, in terms of your CDS obviously things have changed dramatically compared to one or two years ago versus the rest of the sector.</p>
          <p>What do you consider a normalized level of your CDS of your cost of funding? And if the CDS remains at this level, should we foresee any other switch in terms of your funding mix as we have seen this quarter in terms of moving from institutional funding to other types of funding? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to answer on the first one that is very technical, and I'm not sure I will succeed in doing it. In any case, if we look at the page with the Basel 3 effects, DTAs is certainly a change in rules that has created a benefit for us. Others have created a non-benefit that more or less compensate these 40, 50 basis points DTAs positive effect.</p>
          <p>The increase in risk-weighted asset comes from one of the changes introduced in the last month in terms of which assets are part of the [Foreign Language].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cap, the 15% cap or &#x2013; that was introduced in Basel 3. So these are figures that were already, obviously, in our forecast, but have come out and that have created a higher cost in terms of capital consumption. So if we take the 70% cost &#x2013; basis points we had last quarter, we have the net benefit of the AIRB, the internal model adoption has been already embedded in 2010 results. That is in the round of 20 &#x2013; 22 basis points. All the other effects, positive and negative, account for the last few basis points.</p>
          <p>So the 100 basis points you have on the page today is totally consistent with the 70 plus, the plus and minus effect that by pure chance, more or less compensate each other.</p>
          <p>The &#x20AC;60 million you were mentioning in terms of cost, the reduction in the security portfolio is something that is there to stay, at least until we decide to do something differently while the higher cost coming from the Tier 1 issue we made is something that will come &#x2013; that will remain with us also in the future.</p>
          <p>Obviously, as I said before, it will depend on our capability to pass the cost of these issues to our customers. Today we are still in an over-funded position and that's the reason why we kept this &#x20AC;15 billion net on the interest margins.</p>
          <p>On CDS, it's very hard for me to make any assumption on the normal CDS for Intesa Sanpaolo. For sure, we are paying the higher CDS of our own country. I expect and we hope we would be able to prove that our country deserves a lower CDS, but as you know, this is not in our hands. So we will present our best forecast on the occasion of the business plan presentation in the difficult &#x2013; in the different scenario possibilities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just a few questions from my side, just &#x2013; actually on one of the last points you touched on, on funding costs, if I got the answer would &#x2013; that means that your feeling is that even with higher capital ratios Intesa will not benefit any significant improvement from the funding cost, given that it's mainly related to sovereign?</p>
          <p>Then still on capital would &#x2013; if Intesa eventually is included in the systemic relevant bank and asked to bear higher capital charge, should we assume as for other European banks, that the potential gap will be filled with contingent capital instruments?</p>
          <p>Moving on cost, you mentioned in your press release that it's going to be one of the points of the new business plan. Not asking any targets, any evolution, any expectation just a feeling, would you think that the low and weak microeconomic recovery is a limit or the Intesa and the other Italian banks to really improve significantly the efficiency? In other words, how can Intesa and the other Italian banks improve their efficiency significantly while limiting the effect on the real economy and on the employment market?</p>
          <p>And then last point on the CIB division, you mentioned before a lot of numbers and the good results. Going forward is it correct to assume that the &#x20AC;22 billion of risk-weighted asset inflation under Basel 3 will affect this division? And if so, assuming everything else is equal, would you expect the ROE to be lower going forward or do you think you can offset the higher risk-weighted assets and capital allocated with better margins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try. For sure, the sovereign component of our CDS is a very important component of it and that's the same thing for most banks in the &#x2013; for most commercial banks in Europe, but we are optimistic on both components, ours &#x2013; given the plan we will announce and our country because of the management of public accounts we'll continue to have.</p>
          <p>As far as the SIMI effect, it is not today the day for a discussing this point, but as you know contingent capital has not been clarified yet both in the ways it will be usable in the fiscal treatment they &#x2013; it will have and in the trigger mechanism it will be designed.</p>
          <p>So these elements of contingent capital will have to be clarified before we can say if and when and how much we'll use them. The definition of SIMI is also an open one. And as you know size is not the only criterion and we consider both the SIMI and contingent capital very open issues.</p>
          <p>Cost, if I understood correctly your question, you are saying how can you reduce cost without creating a social disarray and then how can you do it?</p>
          <p>Actually, I believe there is the way to reduce useless cost without creating a social disarray as we've done on many occasions, but at the same time I must tell you that the &#x2013; we will manage our bank and the industry will manage, I believe, all the companies in the interest of the shareholders of the banks.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, I only have just one small question on interest rate sensitivity following the divestment of a small part of your &#x2013; or a part of your securities portfolio. It remains the same? Could you update us on what is the sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>It will remain more or less the same. It's obviously a function of our capability to transfer new cost of fund to our customers, but we are not expecting any significant change in the sensitivity we have described often in the past. So that's part of the &#x2013; that's an important component of the business plan presentation, but I can anticipate it will not expect major changes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on slide 23 on the net interest income if you can tell us there is a negative &#x20AC; 69 million that has clearly a big impact on the quarter on quarter evolution of NII. If you can tell us what is this negative impact if there, is any simple explanation?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the cost of credit. Excluding the one-off provisions for Centro Leasing and Neos the cost of credit would have been 70 bps. Do you think that it is correct to look at the normalized cost of credit in the fourth quarter in this way or they are one-off provisions? But every year there is an adjustment of this kind, so 70 bps is, let's say, too optimistic, too low as a normalized cost? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as page 23, the &#x20AC;69 million item is the combination of all the elements I mentioned before, the reduction in security portfolio, the net cost of the Tier 1, and the net effect of all the coverage not included in the hedging position. But the two main elements are the ones we have been discussing altogether during this presentation.</p>
          <p>I will not make any forecast on the cost of credit, but for sure the fact that despite the usual seasonal effect, if you take away, as you have rightly done, the effect of Neos and Centro Leasing on the fourth-quarter results, the fact that we are very much in line with the previous quarters is certainly a very good sign.</p>
          <p>What you should consider another one-off like Neos and Centro Leasing is the &#x20AC;100 million special provision that we have done in risk and charges. And that is coming from a higher than expected accounting benefit that we expected on the fair value evaluation of Intesa Vita, but it was &#x2013; it proved to be higher than expected. And the &#x20AC;100 million provision we made in risk and charges can be considered a one-off.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Passera. You answered to all my questions, just a few details are missing. The first one is on the credit quality, I just wonder whether you can help me to reconcile your comments on credit quality with the charted page 34. On the Banca dei Territori I see in Q4 an increase in your doubtful loans in the division, especially in the SME segment. So I wonder whether you can comment there. Another follow-up on the question on IMI, the slide is page 42, I understood that it was quite a successful year for Banca IMI, and you are going to probably tell us more in the investment plan in terms of capital reallocation. But I see that the bulk of the results come from capital markets, especially fixed income and finance and capital management. We had a difference in ours in terms of interest rates this year vis-&#xE0;-vis last year. So my question is how much of this result is sustainable for 2011?</p>
          <p>And then another question on the sensitivity to rate increase you answered already before. I just want to be &#x2013; I just want to understand if I am not wrong your sensitivity is less than &#x20AC;200 million. But I am just wondering whether you have second thoughts on your hedging policy. You said before that the hedging policy is going to expire in 2012. Maybe you are going to close part of it before in order to reap the total benefits from interest rates. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as page 34, the figures coming from the Banca dei Territori is totally consistent, because the other components of the non-performing loans and the other divisions compensate for it. I think that the Banca dei Territori has done a very rigid exercise at the end of the year, and we would benefit from it from 2011 on.</p>
          <p>The 2010 was very successful for IMI, but I expect the 2011 to go further, and I consider the capital market revenue is sustainable, because the very large part of this capital market revenues come from customer activity, and we still have a very low penetration of IMI services to the rest of &#x2013; to the customer base.</p>
          <p>We see a very large potential, say it in other words, for extending the kind of services IMI sells to a very small percentage of our customers to the majority of our customers. So for these two reasons, I consider that revenue component a sustainable one.</p>
          <p>No &#x2013; last question, no change in hedging policy, and actually the maturity of most of our facilities are beyond 2012 into 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have three questions, the quality capital and visibility of interest rate. I'll start from the last, just asking Mr. Passera, an idea of the dynamic way through which we should see the potential increase in interest rate feed into the banks accounts. I am thinking about three pillars mainly. The benefit on the deposit spread, how much and how do you transfer it to customers, the second pillar being the impact of the hedge on deposits, so if you can break it down according to these different categories, and finally the intra-division impact, mainly referring to the transfer between Banca dei Territori and the CIB division. On capital, you have clearly stated that you consider the current capital ratio is adequate for this environment.</p>
          <p>I wanted to ask you if you would consider these adequate also in a scenario of stronger economic growth. And finally asset quality, if you can go as far as projecting the current improvement in the quarter on quarter flows of the creation of new bad loans to become net recoveries in the foreseeable future. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay. I will probably disappoint you, but all the three questions fall into the agenda of the business plan presentation, and I'm sure that you will have all the answers on that occasion, sorry.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, the first one is on the &#x20AC;100 million potential provision you set aside for possible dispute resolution. So my question is are you referring to something specific or is a generic provision you are making?</p>
          <p>I am asking this because we are seeing other Italian banks, which already made settlement with the Italian Government for past fiscal arbitrage issues. So I was wondering if this is also your case or is something generic that you are doing. The second one is, and I'm sorry to get back to this, if you can please confirm me that is the &#x20AC;150 million the sensitivity you stated in the past, 200 bps shift in the curve. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I'm not wrong, I'm just asking you a conformation, maybe you already said that before in the conference call. If I remember properly in the past you said that the sensitivity of your NII to 100 bps shift in the curve, is the &#x20AC;150 million net, considering the current hedging facility in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as the provision, I would call it generic. The &#x20AC;150 million sensitivity, you're mentioning is purely accounting sensitivity, that does not take into account all the other management actions we always have to take into account. And as I said on many occasions, the real sensitivity in terms of net interest income is at least twice that much.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Only a few words to close our meeting, thank you again for being with us. We are proud of the solidity of the figures we gave you today. We have returned in the first four years since the merger &#x20AC;12 billion in terms of dividends, and we do hope we will be even more effective in the years to come. We will have, I hope, all the answers to all your questions on the occasion of the business plan presentation in a few weeks' time.</p>
          <p>And our &#x2013; so let's see &#x2013; let's meet again in less than three weeks for the business plan. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
