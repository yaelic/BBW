          <p>Good morning everyone and welcome to this presentation of EDF's 2008 Financial Results.  The year 2000 would have been far ago and brand new largely commented on it and you've seen it in the media.  2008 would have been a decisive milestone in the implementation of EDF's strategy both in France and internationally and it's a decisive milestone to structure and consolidate our industrial future.  The two structuring acquisitions that we completed in 2008 lay the foundation for our future expansion in the nuclear revival.  The acquisition of British Energy in the U.K. on the one hand and the Constellation acquisition in the U.S. on the other hand.</p>
          <p>We've actually made the only choice that could guarantee our industrial future, namely to expand outside of our historical borders in France.  Indeed, our leadership in the nuclear industry will take place internationally on those markets where the largest number of nuclear reactors will be built over the next decade.  The recent announcement of the construction of the second EPR reactor in France fits perfectly within this new industrial strategy, namely the development of CO2-free energies in order to bolster our energy independence with a renewal and revival of nuclear power and the development of renewable energy sources.  This is also the only way to sustain our expertise and know-how in order to prepare ultimately the full renewal of the French nuclear generation capacities.  I am convinced that all of these prospects mark a decisive turning point in the history of EDF.</p>
          <p>In the current economic context that we're suffering of a worldwide crisis, our industrial model has shown its robustness and for several reasons.  First of all, electricity is a vital commodity with utilizations that will continue to grow throughout the world. The high demand continues to withstand well, in spite of this context of economic recession and we are convinced based on what we we've observed is that electricity out of all the energies is what is growing the fastest everywhere.  Indeed, while our efforts to -- for demand managements do continue to reduce the consumption per use, the number of uses of electricities have been multiplying.</p>
          <p>In practical terms, what we are observing today is that our large industrial accounts are obviously impacted by the economic context, but we are also seeing, particularly in France, that there is a growth in residential consumption, particularly via growing uses that will offset the decline of industrial consumption.  Beyond this, the key energy issues of security of supply and the fight against climate warming fits within a timeline that goes well beyond the timeline of this crisis.</p>
          <p>Neglecting to respond to this dual energy and environmental challenge today, particularly if you are a global nuclear leader with 36 million customers in Europe, that would severely jeopardize our industrial future, the future of our whole industry and the future of the economic developments.  In order to respond to these issues, we need to invest as of today in energy savings, renewable energy sources and nuclear power.  And this is precisely what is at stake when we relaunched the CapEx program back in 2005.</p>
          <p>Last year, EDF Group invested nearly 30% more in capital expenditure in order to maintain and expand our generation facilities and improve the quality of high transmission and distribution grids.  2009 we will be speeding up the pace of these efforts, particularly in France where we'll be investing over &#x20AC;8 billion, thereby contributing to create approximately 20,000 direct or in-direct jobs in France.</p>
          <p>In order to finance these investments, we can rely on the soundness of our balance sheet on the recurrence of our revenues and on our excellent financial rating, which is the best in the industry.  Daniel Camus will tell you more about that later.  We enjoy one of the most outstanding corporate signature in the market as attested by the success of our recent transaction on the bond market, where we were able to raise nearly &#x20AC;8 billion in January alone.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, let me emphasize that the competitiveness of nuclear power has been boosted versus the analysis we had some -- a few years ago.  Indeed, beyond the lower commodity prices due to the economic context and oil in particular, it is obvious that ultimately the growing scarcity of hydrocarbons will necessarily lead to a sustained high level of the oil barrel and the extensive independence of our generation assets versus hydrocarbons, hydropower and nuclear guarantees the profitability over the long-term.</p>
          <p>The construction of new EPR reactors with a 60-year planned life span fits within this long-term vision.  A few weeks ago, we reevaluated the cost of the EPR Flamanville by 20%. Back in 2005, this cost was estimated at &#x20AC;3.3 billion, it is now estimated at &#x20AC;4 billion for 2008.  In the mean time, the cost of a gas-fired plant concurrently increased 45%, so up 20% for a nuclear plant and while the cost for a coal-fired plant went up 54%.  Hence, we boosted the competitiveness of the nuclear power over this period.  These results should be assessed in the context of a difficult economic environment that has impacted many industries.  In this context, we nevertheless were able to keep and preserve our results.</p>
          <p>Sales revenue consolidated that reached &#x20AC;64.3 billion and organic growth of 10.6%. EBITDA that stood at &#x20AC;15.4 billion before the, of course, of the extended TaRTAM transition tariff. But excluding this non recurring item, the EBITDA has enjoyed an organic growth of 3.7%.  After restatement of the TaRTAM linked provision of 1.2 billion, this leads to an EBITDA of &#x20AC;14.2 billion.  Net income from ordinary operations stood at &#x20AC;4.3 billion, slightly down 6.4% in terms of organic growth.</p>
          <p>In France as I said earlier, our financial results were significantly penalized by a provision that was allowed in 2008; i.e., &#x20AC;1.2 billion which is linked to the one year extension of the TaRTAM transition tariff until mid 2010.  Hence, the EBITDA is down nearly 10%.  Excluding this impact, EBITDA would have been up over 2%.  Over the concerned period for the TaRTAM, that is between early 2007 and mid 2010, the cumulative compensation that we had and will have to pay to our competitors reached or will reach approximately &#x20AC;2 billion.  Internationally and this is cause for great satisfaction for 2008, all of our international subsidiaries have been profitable and have been driving up the growth of the Group.  International revenue was up over 15% in organic growth and EBITDA was up 6.5%.</p>
          <p>2008, let me emphasize this, was a key milestone for the industrial future of our Group.  We've made significant progress in implementing our long-term strategy.  We have reasserted our leadership in nuclear revival throughout the world.  We've boosted our industrial positions and footprints in Europe and we have promoted renewable energy sources as well as energy efficiency.  Let's take a look at these three points one-by-one.</p>
          <p>Leadership in nuclear revival.  Our progress in this nuclear power revival throughout the world relies first and foremost and that gives us &#x2013; makes us a step ahead. It relies as I said, on the exemplary supervision of the construction of the EPR in Flamanville.  In spite of technical contingencies which of course are inherent to construction of such scope and perplexity, we had &#x2013; we used the necessary resources to keep the construction schedule under control and we confirmed the target for commissioning in 2012. And we were very pleased in fact by the approval by French Public Authorities of our project to build a second EPR in France at the Penly site.</p>
          <p>The EPR technology, of course, is a tremendous showcase for French technology and constitutes the best passport for EDF's international expansion in nuclear power.  Hence, this is excellent news for EDF, excellent news for the entire nuclear industry.  It's also excellent news for the energy independence of France and its commercial trade balance.  EDF as I said and I confirm is open to well balanced partnership to be signed with other energy operators such as Enel, which is already our partner at Flamanville or GDF Suez, as well as any other European operators.</p>
          <p>We will be continuing to investigate these key industrial projects in our various governance bodies and in full compliance with all consultation procedures.  In this context, we are planning to start construction in 2012; i.e., the very year when the Flamanville EPR would be -- will be commissioned.  Based on this calendar, we will be able to rely on the expertise and skills of the crews that are currently building the EPR in the Mosh area.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we have gained durable positions in the three key markets for nuclear development over the next 10 years.  If you take the three main nuclear markets, we have -- we are present in China, in the U.K. and in the USA.  In China, of course, the energy market that is growing fastest in the world, we have already started the construction of two EPR reactors at Taishan site in the context of a joint venture in which we hold 30% stake together with historical partner in China CGNPC.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, we believe that the British market will be the European market that will grow the fastest in the nuclear sector. The acquisition of British Energy bolsters our -- the economic and industrial model of EDF Energy.  Our British subsidiaries, thanks to a major increase of our power generation capacities, basically multiplied by three, that will enable us to cover the needs of our customers. And also thanks to a boosted non-CO2 free power generation, that will be reaching 58% of the total generation.  Hence, we've already acquired a major and solid footprints in the U.K. and we will further strengthen it tomorrow by building and operating at least four new EPR reactors in the future.</p>
          <p>As you know, we've also initiated discussions with the British company Centrica to look at conditions for its partnership in this operation up to 25% stake that would be acquired under the same conditions as our own acquisitions.  Today, we are quite confident that agreements can be signed with Centrica over the next few weeks and in any case before the end of the first quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Third key market for nuclear expansion is the United States, which is of course the largest global energy market. In the U.S., we made an offering to acquire 50% of the nuclear assets of our partner in the U.S., Constellation, and we intend to build four EPR reactors, the first of which are at the site of Calvert Cliffs in the state of Maryland.</p>
          <p>Getting back to Europe now, we've been consolidating our industrial positions, as I said in the U.K., where we've become a leader in the power market in the U.K.  In Germany, our subsidiary EnBV (sic) [EnBW] , announced an acquisition of a 26% stake in the EVE Municipal Utility company for &#x20AC;2 billion.  EnBV (sic) [EnBW] has also announced the acquisition of 520 megawatts in fossil-fire generations from E.ON.  In Switzerland, EDF with its 25% stake in the capital of ALPIQ, EDF has become the international and industrial benchmark partner of the new energy leader in the country, now named ALPIQ, which is actually a combination of the business activities of Atel and EOS, both Swiss energy operators.</p>
          <p>Lastly in the natural gas, Edison has boosted its position as well.  In particular, with access to new gas reserves in Egypt and with the commissioning plan this year of the very first offshore LNG terminal built in Rovigo.  Lastly, EDF has gained a majority stake in gas fields in the North Sea, all of which contributes to strengthen supply &#x2013; security of supply for gas for the entire Group.</p>
          <p>The energy efficiency and sustainable development component includes naturally renewable energy sources where we've speeded up the pace of expansion by defining new growth targets for our subsidiary EDF Energy Nouvelles. These targets now involve 4,000 megawatts of installed capacities by 2012, including 500 megawatt in the form of solar photovoltaic power.  In order to support this ambition, we were involved in the capital increase of 500 million that took place last year at EDF Energy in Nouvelles.</p>
          <p>In hydropower, which is the leading renewable energy, we have continued our SuperHydro maintenance program for which we had announced an investment of &#x20AC;500 million over five years and in 2008 naturally we completed &#x2013; we made major progress at the Nam Theun dam construction site in Laos.  We recently completed the filling of the reservoir dam.</p>
          <p>From the commercial standpoint, we continue and we will continue the roll out of our energy efficiency offerings.  Hence, 250,000 services offers for energy services and renewable energy, particularly decentralized energy in France were rolled out.  Lastly, we've announced our choice of a technology to build the very first marine current turbine at the Paimpol-Brehat site in Brittany in the context of our pilot trial to build current turbine to produce electricity from the energy contained in tidal currents.</p>
          <p>This is it for my introduction.  Daniel Camus will now detail the financial results from the year.  Daniel Camus, you have the floor, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all.  Just a few details about the Group's income statement in France and abroad. Regarding the overall figures, two comments I'd like to make. First, we're on target given what we said regarding EBITDA. Outside -- excluding the impact of TaRTAM, we had said that we would be around 3%; we're 3.7% today. With significant TaRTAM impact slightly higher than planned, a net income minus 4%, it's at minus 6% at the end of the year, very much impacted by the resumption of investments, which I will tell you more about it in a moment.</p>
          <p>Today, we are in a situation regarding organic growth, sales in EBITDA. Regarding the scope, the most important thing is Mexico having an impact &#x2013; a reduction of 650 million from one year to the other, 110 million for EBITDA. Regarding exchange, the only significant impact is related to the British pound. You know how the pound has evolved, that has had a negative impact of 1.2 billion on sales, a little less than 200 million on EBITDA.  So the figure being 10.6, 3.7 with major difference between France and International.  In France plus 2.2%, at the International level we have a rate of plus 6.5%.</p>
          <p>One word about the TaRTAM. It makes a difference whether you look at the figures with or without the TaRTAM, the figures are quite different, the amount is very high.  We -- for the enabling legislation, we had made a preliminary estimation of a billion, where the actual figure is 1.2 billion.  The few parameters used are the following: this is the setting up of a provision related to the fact that TaRTAM was extended for a year.  Second half of '09, first half of 2010 on a volume of close to 40 additional terawatt hour, an average sourcing cost of competitors calculated around &#x20AC;68, around &#x20AC;43, 32 times the volume gives a figure of &#x20AC;1.2 billion and rounded figure, a very substantial figure without absorption, no financing capacity available from CSPA after tax, 783 million after-tax as Pierre was saying.  Between '06, '07, '09, that represents &#x20AC;2 billion.  1.2 billion plus 800 million that is for the TaRTAM impact.</p>
          <p>As for the overall income statement globally and then per country, you see that fuel and energy purchases have gone up by 3.8 billion, more than 20% from one fiscal period to the other, especially Internationally.  Here you have the gas, the formal gas and coal impact and in France you have figure of 18%. As for the OpEx, a total of one plus 5% over the period, more strongly in France 7%, 1.4% internationally.  I'll give you more information about the France aspect in a minute.</p>
          <p>We'll start with by France.  In France, the first graph now that you probably know in parallel the variation in production and purchases sales.  First thing, despite kD that is lower than last years', 79.2%, thanks to a usage rate that is better than last year.  Last year it was 94.2%, this year it's 95.2, so generation is almost stable 0.4 of variation.</p>
          <p>The usage rate has almost made up for the KD that is lower than last year's, one point.  Hydraulic, hydropower plus 4.8% which is under seasonal averages, but better than the last two fiscal periods.  Generation explains almost all of the totality 4.8, 4.9.  On the right hand side, the distribution of sales, an increasing amount of sales to end-users. Out of the 441 million, about 300 terawatt hours or at tariff in one form or the other 300 out of 441, 55 TaRTAM. As for net wholesale markets and auctions, they go down by 12 terawatt hour.  So a kind of a shear effect, one interacting with the other favorable on VPP, plus three terawatt hour, minus 54 net wholesale markets and auctions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to dwell a little on France, most of what I said is related to France. The sales growth broken down into three parts.  First part, the volume effect, in total 1.5% increase out of 6.3% networks, the volume energy component's 1.3 billion, and net market sales, the reflection -- the translation in euro from the previous graph, total of 1.5%.  Prices and tariffs -- that represents an evolution of 3.8%.  In this amount, the price increase represents 600 million out of the 1.245 billion and price forward VPP 410 million.  Natural Gas and Services, it's a small amount, out of the 336 million gas sales represent 208, 3.7% of market sales for end-users. So much for sales.</p>
          <p>As for the rest of the income statement, 1.4 billion in absolute values with a cost of 1.6 billion and also a cost of fuel -- 100 in fossil fuel &#x2013; 140 million and those purchases.  Another important change, the evolution of OpEx. The totals of staff cost and other external consumption increases by 7% in total, of which 6% for personal staff, 8% for other external consumption.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you what we said at the beginning of the year about the step effect that did a number of costs that are going to become structural, that is related to retirement. If you make them about retirement 150 million nuclear, maintenance and other expenses, representing 300 million plus 50 million total. Out of this 7%, 500 million; i.e., 4% contribute to what we said the increase the base cost, which doesn't change the natural evolution of cost. The major &#x2013; the two major changes you see in France that there is a significant volume effect, but also a kD usage rate impact plus a high OpEx impact plus 7%.</p>
          <p>At the International level, as Pierre said earlier, a good performance at the International level almost everywhere throughout the world.  I'd even say everywhere, with a higher contribution of trading given the volatility of markets, this year was the best for EDF Trading -- plus 6.5% for EBITDA.  If you restate for the effect of IAS 39 regarding a number of contracts, this increase would have been 21% at the International level.  If we didn't take into account the effect of IAS 39, this was therefore an excellent year.</p>
          <p>The major figures EDF Energy for the subsidiary this is what you have the most significant effect of IAS 39 and sometime asked this question in England in '06.  The effect was negative and also in total you have an impact of 438 million over this period.  If you have any questions resulting from the valuation of hedging commodity contract, a negative effect outside of that you see that the operating basis of EDF Energy is sound and has grown by 23%.  Thanks notably to significant tariff increases last year, EDF Energy has raised the tariff of 25% for power and 35% for gases, the situation being the reverse this year. There is also the effect of grid revaluation.</p>
          <p>One word about British Energy. Clearly, British Energy is only partly in the accounts, given it was only acquired '09, but it will enter the Company's consolidation scope as of January 1.  We have finished the deal from a financial point of view since January 9, so we have consolidated a full-year of British Energy in our accounts.</p>
          <p>One important thing, the acquisition cost of British Energy is 13.5 billion. You'll remember from our previous presentations that we had estimated the maximum amount to 15.7 billion.  So there is a two billion difference related to the parity between the Euro and the Pound which wasn't at all favorable to us. Same thing for consolidation, in Euros there is difference of two billion related. The consolidation will be done by global integration with 25% of minority interest.</p>
          <p>Centrica we're waiting for the conclusion of agreements for the end of the first quarter.  Everything is going according to plan, even though there are few difficulties, but things are going well with Centrica.</p>
          <p>In the disposal mentioned by Mr. Gadonneix the 25% are not mentioned, this is on top and not included in the &#x20AC;5 billion of disposal present. This is on top of the &#x20AC;5 billion. I heard some people asking the question. As for the contribution to Group EBITDA, it would be around &#x20AC;1.5 billion with an impact in the first year for the part that is not covered by the portfolio, the price reduction in U.K., so we're exposed on that part. We will be presenting end of June the allocation of the acquisition cost; the purchase accounting will be finalized at this date.</p>
          <p>A few words about E&amp;BV (sic) [EnBW] . You know that they published their figures two days ago. The figures are excellent, mainly thanks to the electrical activities of the group plus 13% sales wholesale optimization of the upstream portfolio, all of the purchase were favorable. Unfortunately, you know that the German regulators reviewed the tariff of the gas sector which has an impact of 174 million in our accounts impairment.  And we should have a number of information from German competition soon.</p>
          <p>Italy. The beginning of the year was difficult for Edison. I don't know if you remember, we were at minus 25% of EBITDA &#x2013; for EBITDA the first quarter, which is very -- was very bad.  Our ambition was at least duplicate last year's performance which was good in the end, plus 5% for EBITDA in Italy, with a very positive price effect. Arbitrage tradeoff between end-user not so much for <mark type="inaudible" />. Globally, plus 5%. Here again you have seen that Edison just published their accounts for 2009. They would like replicate at least, despite price volume volatility and the way they would like to have the replicate the same performance in '09.</p>
          <p>What about the rest of Europe? This is EBITDA of 2.2 billion. It's -- more than the rest of Europe, it's more than Germany, more than Italy combined. It's very productive for the Group, which changes very quickly plus 22%.  All segments are progressing. EDF Trading has had a historic year plus 78%, 1.24 billion of contribution to EBITDA.  Trading margins have gone up by more than 90%. As for gas, they have gone up of more than 50%.  The year was very good. EDF Energy Nouvelles has just also had an increase in EBITDA plus 33%. Eastern Europe same thing increase rates of eight to 10%. Hungary, for example, with double-digit growth rate. A good year for the rest of Europe and all European countries, outside of the impact of IAS 39, EBITDA plus 20%.</p>
          <p>Operating excellence, thanks to our sales on markets and thanks to our second performance program launched at the end of the first quarter of 2008.  We're almost on target 285 million.  We have low startup, but now we have more than 300 identified projects.  You see the distribution between France and abroad one-third, two-thirds.  Clearly, we're on target and they're going to be increasingly delivering to reach an objective of 600 million, one billion also.  This is an excellent guarantee for the <mark type="inaudible" /> company.</p>
          <p>One word about the change in net income. I have seen regarding the consensus, I was able to see that the financial results was one of sources of variance.  I'd like to tell you about the move. There's  a mechanical move which might not be perceived by all, an impact of &#x2013; negative impact of 600 million on financial result the difference between two years -- 633 million.  A minor impact related to the increase in the cost of that 52 million, which is not much when you see the increase of debt. A lot of outlays are done at the end of the year.  So, only an impact of 50 million, but a more important impact related to the increase in discounting expenditures, an increase in discounting expenditure related to the enlargement of nuclear provision -- the increase of the base of nuclear provision. So the discounting base increases by 165 million.  That is a source of variance from an arithmetic point of view.</p>
          <p>Third factor, 400 million related to the drop in financial expenditures and income. We have carried out in '08 an impairment of our shares in Constellation. Based on the intrinsic value, an impairment of &#x20AC;156 million.</p>
          <p>Another element related to corporate income tax, it's higher by 33% whereas it was 24.5% last year.  This is a mechanical factor again last year Germany, U.K. and Italy had announced a reform in corporate income tax.  We had to in fact a free number of deferred assets.  This is not the case here and this is the main reason explaining why this year we had a higher rate of 33% instead of 31, 32%.</p>
          <p>I'd like to tell you now about non-recurring elements. Last year we had number of positive element with important contribution. Capital gains disposal &#x2013; capital gains on disposal, Mexico notably this year, you see that out of the minus 908 million, there's one that weighs more than the others. What I said earlier, 783 million because of TaRTAM law. It's very high, then 246 for the E&amp;BV (sic) [EnBW] Grid Gas provision for risks impairment and also the impairment on Constellation of 156 million.</p>
          <p>Dividend as announced in spite of lower recurring income, a constant dividend that will remain constant between '07 and '08 of &#x20AC;1.28 per share. We paid in interim dividend in December of 0.64;  the balance will be paid; i.e., &#x20AC;0.64 per share.</p>
          <p>Few words about the cash flow. We see the FFO funds from operation of 10.1 billion, with two significant cash consumption sources. The first one is, naturally, capital expenditure for 9.7 billion, below the average of 12 billion for the next three years, yes definitely.  But a sharp increase of 30% versus the previous fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Working capital variation 2.5 billion due to several factors. Increased inventories 800 million; that is coal, gas, oil, fuel oil and so on all combined, all of which are impacted.  And an increase of margin calls that are linked to the upstream, downstream optimization and trading activities of approximately &#x20AC;700 million.  The remainder &#x20AC;800 million, the receivables of course increase, the tradables increase and so on.  So, cash consumption of 2.5 billion largely temporary and that will be reversed naturally over the coming months.</p>
          <p>Net debt as of end December 2008, we went from 16.3 up to 24.5 billion, with dedicated assets of 1.8 billion below the normal practice, since in view of the extreme volatility, we suspended these allowance allocation for dedicated assets. When you have a volatility of 70% on your stock while historically it was down at 20, clearly that would be an investment in view of our 20-30, 20-35 timeline would not be advisable.  So 1.8% -- 1.8 billion in dedicated assets.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions, out of the 4.6 you have two cash payments. British Energy 2.7, approximately 26% shares bought from the market for a total amount of 2.7 billion, purchased in 2008. That's for British Energy and 1.3 billion for Constellation.  We had interest payment of one billion on the 17th of December to be reimbursed, if you will, offset at the time of closing.  So British Energy, Constellation that's four billion out of these 4.6 billion in acquisition. If you want details on the remaining acquisitions, let me know. This was an overview of EDF Energy's net debt.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, a few words. In the current context, it's important to take a look at the financial position of the company, which is very sound.  EDF, of course, has been managing its financial position in a very cautious and serene manner. Our debt of 24 billion is a multiple of 1.7 EBITDA. You can access that versus the industry average. That should be increasing in 2009 naturally, with a payment to be made on Constellation and British Energy.</p>
          <p>Cash-flow from operations, FFO that always exceeds &#x20AC;10 billion in a recurring manner.  Access to bank facilities and credits are I would call them preferred. We were able to mobilize &#x20AC;11 billion to finance the British Energy transaction while no other company anywhere can raise 11 billion on syndicated loan markets.  We've already paid back 50% in advance out of these 11 credit facility, which was on the 5th of January. Now we're down at 5.5 billion.  We have two years normally to reimburse it, one year plus one year renewable. The very first tranche of that credit facility was fully pre-paid, the rest of course has a longer maturity date.  We had several &#x2013; we had several bond issues and a 7% average cost is actually been reduced in all of these bond issues.</p>
          <p>Second pillar &#x20AC;10 billion in available syndicated undrawn credit lines, including six billion in France, 3.8 of course for EnDW and Edison, with a reserve just in case, no intention for the time being to draw on it, but it is a good financial cushion if you will.</p>
          <p>And on the right hand side as you see here, this is situation of financial markets which can be absolutely crazy sometime these days, but EDF's corporate name is doing well and is well accepted in the financial markets.  We've been issuing annual securities, our treasury bonds in the U.S. and various bonds in reoccurring way.  In Europe, we now reached 5.5 billion.  And we're one of these industrial players that fuel and feed from these financial markets in a regular manner.</p>
          <p>And as Pierre Gadonneix said earlier, we proved able to finalize several -- two major bond issues for the past few months.  We issued over &#x20AC;11 billion since the end of November, with the first wave of 3.5-4 billion in November, December. Then we issued two billion in Euros and that was the biggest operation, plus &#x20A3;1.4 billion and 400 million in Sterlings, with two issues of two times two billion in Euros once again. And for the first time ever in 20 years, we went back to the U.S bond market and we found a demand that exceeded the offer. We raised five billion in the U.S. on five,10 and 30 years maturity date.  The lowest rate for the &#x20A4;6 bond at 5.1%, the highest rate is the $30 bond at 6.9% just to give you an idea of the rates.</p>
          <p>So, we've extended the maturity of the corporate debt and we lowered the financial cost.  So, today very early in this year we have financed most of our requirements. The majority of our bond requirements at a cost, if you look at the dollar between the time three weeks ago when we issued and today, we would have been paying 100 basis points in addition, quite simply because Governments of all countries of course are now very active on these bond markets.  So, just to tell you of course there are investing problems.  We're currently -- we will be finalizing the acquisitions of British Energy and of Constellation, but we already &#x2013; we already have behind us most of the &#x2013; all of the financing conditions at preferred conditions, particularly in view of the current markets.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daniel.  Before opening up the Q&amp;A session, let me say a few words to shed some light on the future and for these results in perspective of the current context in which we operate.  First of all, in an industry like ours it's always essential to remember the major changes in the regulatory context.  Let me start with a few details, some insight of what's happening in this area.</p>
          <p>In France to begin with, last November the French government created a new Commission chaired by Mr. Champsaur, the so called Champsaur Commission, to identify future potential changes in tariffs and rates particularly in view of TaRTAM maturity. The deadline is 2010 for these transition tariffs and it is viewed well is the context of opening competition on deregulated markets in view as well changes in European directives. The EU commission is expected to release its proposals in March or April.</p>
          <p>Brief reminder as well about changes in European regulation. The adoption of the climate package last December is a major indicator of the future context over the coming years. Indeed, this climate package increases the competitiveness of carbon free or low carbon energy in view of course of the challenge of this directive on CO2 cost. Hence, this will boost once again the competitiveness of nuclear power.</p>
          <p>In addition, the European Commission last December notified a list of grievances to EDF linked to the long-term purchasing in commercial contracts with our industrial customers. The Commission is worried about the compatibility between relationships with industrial customers and the competition rules on an EU level. And EDF is currently preparing responses to start discussions with the EU Commissions.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we're now expecting guidelines from the new administration, though first indications seem to show that the new U.S. Administration is in favor of lower carbon economy.  Lastly, in 2009 the Copenhagen conference will be held, a location for all countries in the world to agree on the continuation or renewal of the Kyoto protocol that is planned to run until 2012, a protocol that defines the context for sustainable development.</p>
          <p>All of this confirms that energy independence and the fight against climate warming are the two key long-term challenges for the energy industry and both are at the height of EDF's strategy.  Another point I would like to stress for -- in the context of our business for the coming years in particularly for 2009.  Let me add that for EDF the year 2006 included highly structuring operations of acquisitions. I spoke about them earlier, so did Daniel Camus. 2009, in turn, will be devoted to organic growth and to the integration of our acquisitions.</p>
          <p>After laying the foundations of our industrial growth and expansion, we now need to guarantee the conditions of its success and this will involve a number of projects, topics, issues. I would like to mention in particular the improvement of our nuclear efficiency performance.  We confirm our target to increase the availability factor of our French nuclear plants from 79.2% Kd in 2008 up to 85% by 2011; i.e., a pace of improvement that is close to 2% per annum in terms of Kd availability factor.  To do so, we will be taking measures at different levels, all of which are currently underway and have already started.</p>
          <p>The first level will be to speed up the heavy maintenance investments, which have doubled between 2005 and 2008 and that is designed in particular to improve the availability factor -- Kd factor.  Second area of improvement will be to reduce the duration of maintenance shutdowns by improving the organization of operations.  Third area of improvement will be to extend the life span or the life cycle of fuel recharge for four of our nuclear units. Fourthly, we want to continue to deal with the technical failures and contingency that we mentioned earlier, namely on steam generators and alternators.</p>
          <p>And now another way to improve the efficiency of our power assets is the potential extension of the life span of our nuclear assets, which is of course a key driver. I remind you that reactors of similar technologies that are currently operate in the U.S. -- several dozens of them -- have now been authorized to operate for a life span of 60 years. Hence, we will be opening discussions with the nuclear safety authorities in the context of the preparation of the next 10-year shutdown inspections, or rather maintenance inspections in the French power plants. Just to give you an idea and an order of magnitude, we estimate that investments required to extend the life span of a reactor by 20 years to approximately 10% of the cost of a new built EPR type power plant.  Hence, this as I repeat, this is a tremendous driver, but will require additional investment efforts over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Year 2009 will also involve a continuation of our operational capital spending in our industrial assets in order to boost its efficiency and performance and to continue to respond to requirements of service quality and service level.  We'll be investing this year over eight billion, you see here on this slide 7.5, because this is a proportion of EDF SA. To recheck, when I speak up &#x20AC;8 billion we naturally include our French subsidiaries in particularly &#x2013; in particular EDF Energy Nouvelles in the renewable sector.  So, we will be investing over &#x20AC;8 billion in France; i.e., &#x20AC;2.5 billion more than in 2008.  These investments are of course necessary. Recent incidents have reminded us of this necessity.</p>
          <p>I remind you that the lower power exports from France in 2008 shows that we no longer have any surplus capacities. Of course, we've been anticipating all this since 2005, and since then we've already commissioned over 3,000-megawatt of essentially fossil-fire capacities between 2006 and '08.  The target at the time was to commission 6,000-megawatts in addition by 2012, so we've now reached halfway.  These 3000 megawatts in newly available capacities have enabled us to face the cold spell in early January.  For three days in a row, where we had record peak demand, we made good use of these new capacities.  Hence, these investment efforts must continue over time.</p>
          <p>And so, we have a number of projects underway and particularly the gas fired plants in Blenod and Martigues this will be CCGT plants, the EPR in Flamanville of course is an ongoing project and the second EPR reactor to be built in Penly, all of which goes in the same direction, meaning that we've now come back to a sustainable pace for the development of new capacities.</p>
          <p>In the field of networks, grids, weather supply or transmission grids, maintaining the quality of our public service will require new capital spending as well. Investments that are to be incorporated in the ongoing discussions on the third party access rates. The recent weather conditions of course have emphasized the importance of this challenge. You see EDF has stayed the course of investment, has pursued its industrial project to secure the growth of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>In order to funding this capital spending, what are we going to do?  Well, first of all and as always, we will be counting on ourselves.  As I told you last year and Daniel Camus referred it to it earlier, we launched last year a program to improve our performance, which we call Operational Excellence program, intended to improve our income and profits by optimizing our operational processes.  This program is now underway, and will continue for three years. It's applicable to France as well as foreign subsidiaries.  And the first results obtained in 2008 are in line with our expectations.  We are thereby confirming our target of &#x20AC;1 billion in net synergy gains on EBITDA by 2010.  And of course we have regular exchanges with public authorities regarding the level of prices, rates and tariffs that are necessary to back and support the resumption of investments both in generation assets as well as transmission or distribution grids.</p>
          <p>Year 2009 will also be a year for us to integrate our newly acquired companies.  Our targets were synergy gains, which we had estimated at the time of British Energy acquisition, namely &#x20AC;220 million per annum starting from the 3rd year of integration.  And it's a new organization of our business in the U.K., which is currently going on and partially implemented is designed precisely to reach these performance gains. We've already found that the four &#x2013; we've already re-commissioned or restarted four reactors that had been shut down for several months in Hartlepool and Heysham and we're quite confident that all four reactors will be fully operational before the end of this month.</p>
          <p>Lastly, EDF is particularly pleased with the progress recently announced and the changes recently announced by the British Public Authorities regarding the certification and consulting procedures for the commissioning of a new EPR type nuclear power plant by 2017.</p>
          <p>After having recalled this context in this main orientation, 2001 (sic) [2011] will be a year in which we will continue and consolidate the actions started in '08 with the priority to internal growth and the integration of acquired companies.  And of course, the financial and economic crisis, which is unprecedented at the world level, will necessarily mark this year in 2009 and our group might feel the impact of the crisis.  But our conviction is that this impact will be more limited than in other sectors.</p>
          <p>This impact will depend on the countries and on the activities of the group, depending on their sensitivity to price changes for electricity -- consumption of electricity. In France for example, we are very little exposed to market prices because of our generation mix. 90% of our generation is nuclear and or hydraulic is not impacted by changes in energy prices, notably oil prices. And also because of the fact that our prices &#x2013; the prices at which we sell electricity are tariff prices, hence non-sensitive to the uncertainties of market prices.</p>
          <p>As out of France, however, subsidiaries will have to take account of the new situation. They have hedging policies as normal in this sector. These hedging policies can change from one country to another, therefore the market price exposure might vary from one subsidiary to another. Given all that, we are confident for 2009.</p>
          <p>At the financial level now, we are anticipating enhanced and faster growth of EBITDA because of the acquisitions made in 2008 and their integration. On a like-for-like basis -- on the basis of the same scope, our organic growth objective for EBITDA is modest given the economic context I have just recalled.</p>
          <p>The net income excluding non-recurring elements should not be growing, especially since we are going to be continuing our investment program.  We will have a growth of EBITDA, but not the net income.  We are taking all necessary measures to face the present economic situation and as I said, our ambition is to improve our operating performance. In parallel, we have decided to start a disposal program, the objective of which being as when we did for 2006, 2009, our objective here would be to reduce the debt by at least &#x20AC;5 billion between 2009 and 2010. This is why we are starting 2009 with confidence.</p>
          <p>We want to keep our industrial ambition and of course this goes much beyond the time horizon of the crisis.  I would like to tell you again how much trust I have in EDF's industrial future. This company is just being recognized as being the preferred company of the French population. 2008 will certainly have -- meant a change in our industrial ambition. We have laid the foundation of a sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>The future of the EDF Group is now part and parcel of Europe and more broadly in the world wherever nuclear revival has started. This is a formidable opportunity for our group, for its employees, its customers, its partners, and its shareholders.  Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to ask Jean-Louis Mathias, Dominique to come to the roster and with the members of the COMEX, we are ready to answer any question you may have.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric Lopez from Merryl Lynch. A few questions, one about the evolution of volumes. Can you tell us more specific indication of the evolution of volumes in France, electricity sold, what is going &#x2013; what could be the impact of EDF's results, given your generation mix?  Regarding disposals, a reduction of a debt by five billion, which represent eight billion of disposals, there are three in British Energy. Can we have more details about the five additional ones?  Third question, do you have a dividend policy for next year?  Finally, you announced a modest EBITDA growth for '09.  Are we talking about levels that are equivalent to the levels of '08, what you had said during IPO given guidance of three to 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding volumes sold in France, what we're observing in the last quarter we see a drop in sales to corporations. That is related to technical unemployment measures we have seen in the last quarter of '08.  On the full-year basis, that will only represent two to 3% in terms of volume. In parallel to that, we're observing a growth in domestic consumption, residential consumption. Residential consumption is continuing mainly because the number of applications using electricity is growing. Each electricity use -- the number of applications is going up, whereas the quantity of electricity per application is going up. So in terms of volumes, it will have no effect just a few percent, maybe one to 3% in terms of volume.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBITDA now, that has no effect for us. There would have no effect for us, as you know we're obliged to buy electricity, so it has no negative impact. It has no negative effect. Paradoxically, it even has a slightly positive effect at that level, but if it was to increase it would reduce our receipts but for now it has no negative effect,</p>
          <p>Regarding disposals, maybe I can ask to answer.  We have indicated a figure of at least five billion. We have talked about such disposals at least five billion, we did 5.7 billion. We do have a number of vague ideas, it would be counter-productive to publish the list of disposals in terms of optimization.  So, we apologize we can't be more specific on that. The impact on that it will be partly cash and partly debt reduction.  And that is on top of the 25% of Centrica &#x2013; 25% of Centrica's acquisition &#x2013; British Energy's acquisition price.</p>
          <p>So much for disposals, regarding our dividend policy, we haven't articulated yet any dividend policy for '09. Like many corporations, we have limited our outlook to '09. Our dividend policy's always been 50%, so far giving ourselves a few months depending on market practices we're also aware of expectations in relation to our competitors.  We will refine it and develop it as the year goes on.</p>
          <p>Last question regarding the growth of EBITDA, we want to be careful also there, you know that we had a few difficulties.  We have delivered our EBITDA growth every year; we haven't moderated it, it starts at a given level, so we have wanted to be cautious but we want to deliver an EBITDA growth. We want to surprise you a little.  So let us -- leave us that possibility of surprising you a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> A few questions if I may.  In the U.K., could we have some more details about volumes, terawatt, average price per end user? As far as I'm concerned, I was expecting better results in the U.K. outside of monetary effects. To go back to what you said about volumes in France, I have here net deliveries. What we see is that in January, February, and March we were down. Only in April, May, June, and we had drastic drop after that.</p>
          <p>So I have difficulty understanding why the TaRTAM effect is that important, because if an increasingly faster drop of industrial sales, why is that the industrial effect is not higher than that? It doesn't correspond because I have for ARPU.</p>
          <p>Regarding your vision about French tariffs, this is very political issue. I'm sure that you're not going to answer it, but what you are going to ask Sarkozy regarding tariffs and EDF is a tool for the state. What about the employment policy maybe Lagarde will tell us?  I have noticed that in the last two years, you now have a non-replacement rate that is increasing. What's your present situation regarding TaRTAM 1.2 billion? I don't understand, last year you're expecting a major drop in the provision which seems obvious to us, yes the TaRTAM provision.</p>
          <p>Regarding the calculation of TaRTAM in '08 and the incidents of volume maybe, Jean-Louis, are you talking about '09 or '08 or the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the TaRTAM effect is the multiplication of volume by our price. Today we haven't noted any massive effect on our competitors' sales, so we have cautious attitude on this chapter. Besides, our calculations take into account the fact that competitors are not compensated on the day price but the price at which they have bought the electricity. Most of them had implemented hedging mechanism even before the law was voted.  So we take account what we think is the likely price at which they actually hedged.</p>
          <p>Regarding TaRTAM and the change future change of provision it will depend on the outlaying of the money. Today, our best assumption is that 95% will be paid in 2008. There is residue in 2010 of 150 million to be very specific.</p>
          <p>Another person on the phone was asking &#x2013; and this question was just answered by Jean-Louis about power price assuming -- that is assumed.</p>
          <p>Regarding tariffs now, you must be aware of the fact that we have &#x2013; now in a different context, if you look at what happened in the last 25 years, the power prices have gone down by 40% in constant Francs. In 25 years, the price of electricity has not changed. Inflation was totally passed on the consumer.  And this was in the period where EDF reduced its investment.  We had to setup our fleet, but then we had slowed down our investments in a substantial manner.  Now we need to resume our investment program and for a long time. Why is it that we have to do that? Because we no longer have a capacity surpluses; we had surpluses for 25 years used by exports and also unused in some cases.  This capability surplus now is disappeared.  We have to develop our capabilities depending -- based on the market growth one to 2000 megawatts per year for a long time.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have to improve our kD and invest in the quality of our industrial tool.  Finally, the recent storm showed it, we already knew it, it is important to focus on that.  The indicator is the average time during which you no longer have power.  This ratio improved for a long time but now is no longer improving and this indicates that we need to resume investments.  So tariffs whether it is for distribution, transportation, and generation, all of these tariffs must reflect the fact that we have entered a period in which we have to resume investment.  Last year, we raised our tariffs in line with our expectations. For the future I am confident.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's close on the subject.  It's Daniel Camus.  We were asked to report on the Champsaur Commission work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer from Pierre Gadonneix, this would be premature to report on it, because the commission is currently working and investigating.  Its remit is to come up with proposals to the public authorities as well as the French Parliament.  The TaRTAM tariff is covered by a law voted and adopted by the Parliament.  The Champsaur Commission, that includes several experts of the area, is to propose a new law or bill that would reconcile everything I said.</p>
          <p>Everyone is perfectly aware that we need to re-launch investments.  That it should be cost should be pass-through to the customer rates.  European requirements, of course, in Europe we're working in a regulatory context that provides for deregulating the markets and liberalizing competition. Thirdly, how can we ensure that the nuclear assets, which is a key asset for France, can be used as best and leveraged in favor of the French and European economy?  So we need to reconcile all of these factors. I believe that the Champsaur Commission will be releasing its report in April or May. And for the time being, we don't know what its position is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To conclude on the issue of rates and tariffs -- this is Daniel Camus &#x2013; what of our discussions on the terp third-party access fees?  Well, this part of the issue. When you talk about electricity rates and prices, you have a portion that is linked to transmission and distribution supply, and the role of the regulator, of course, under this terp third-party access regulation, is essential. The regulator itself makes proposal to public authorities to set these third-party fees</p>
          <p>Now for the generation side, the regulator only issues an opinion.  But at the end of the day, naturally power rates -- the electricity prices must include both components, transmission and generation.  And the proportion of the components are basically similar, regulator component is slightly more for residential prices and lower for industries -- industrial prices.  But the Champsaur Commission is looking at all electricity rates and tariffs.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Few words about employment. You raised a question on the issue as to how we cope and handle the changes in employment.  Now we, of course, have an ongoing industrial dialogue so that we can help the company involve in a very contemporary manner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two performance drivers if you will.  First of all, we need to keep control of the headcounts in line with the requirements of our skills as well as the OpEx. The ratio is three replacements for five departures.  The second key level is skills and upskilling and we have targets to upgrade the professional skills, which means we also need to have recruitment target. We have 15,000 targeted recruitment. We hired 3,000 new employees between the three companies EDF SA, EDF and RTE, all of these naturally keeping full control over our headcounts. And we hire people where we can generate performance and that is the case of course in the nuclear sector where we have high requirements for expert skills.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was another question on the U.K.  Vincent de Rivaz is going to answer. Vincent de Rivaz, CEO of EDF Energy.  The question was the following, do you in other words, you think that the operational performance EBITDA is not as high as you thought -- 24.5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's excellent performance in the U.K that we achieved, if you want my opinion, and as Daniel Camus said, this is linked to three factors in the U.K. Well positioned in due time and at the right level increase our rates plus 5% increase in our generation linked to an improved availability of our power plants and then revenues are steadily growing from our regulated business, still accounting for 75% of the total EBITDA figure.  My own feeling is that this operational performance is quite satisfactory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We generally don't communicate on specific market segments.  However, overall, both for residential customers, commercial business, and industrial customers, these &#x2013; the overall business generated a profit margin that was significantly higher than last year, reflected in this increase in our operating income.  Let me add to that.  Now, the volatility that we've observed and this does raise these issues on their mark-to-market at the end of the year, due to our independence, particularly on gas. That phenomenon will largely be disappearing over time. With the integration of British Energy, we'll switch from a short to a long type of company.  As &#x2013; and this is one of the two ambitions we've had, when acquiring British Energy.  Precisely, so things should be reverting very quickly in 2009 already.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley.  I have two questions regarding 2009 essentially.  First of all, I'd like to come back to slide 17, which shows net sales on the French markets and the right column, you have three customer segments basically and users included regulated customers.  Everyone can get an idea of price changes.  Net wholesale markets and auctions you can have an idea of average figures by looking at the curves.  What about -- that leaves us with structured sales 61 terawatt-hour in 2008. What kind of visibility do you have about average prices that you could be getting in '09 and 2010? So what is your current basic average price, perhaps? What type of hedging policy do you have on these volumes, if that is an issue? And then finally, is there an impact -- a later impact on multi annual contracts which would give us some visibility for the period 2009, 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have 61 terawatt-hour of structured sale. Three components: long term industrial contracts, equity interest 12, another direct sales excluding VPP 20.  So, we have three categories of different answers, if you will. We can answer on these three categories, of course, and the other is we are talking about volumes that are sold based on regulated tariffs, green, yellow, blue or TaRTAM, which is a tariff in itself.  So the answer on forecast for these volumes would be the answer I gave you earlier.</p>
          <p>Now for the other segments, yes the pricing structure is slightly different perhaps Jean-Louis can respond to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our risk management policy regarding these type of sales is a minimum risk type of policy. In other words, we systematically hedge as soon as we know the volumes at issue.  So we have a relatively good visibility on -- when we talk about our forecast for the year 2009, naturally this is taken into account. Of course, this has its counterpart, something that was mentioned by Daniel earlier, but it's not a reason for us to change our minimum risk policy on the energy markets. Now, obviously this hedging leads to the creation of a number of collaterals on the side of the trading business that is found in the corporate working capital, but we continue to believe that this is the most reasonable policy to pursue.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where does synergy from British Energy come from? Is it more cost cutting or are there any new revenue operational improvement synergies</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The response. Maybe listening to us of the 222 is made of 40 million revenue related synergies, 160 million are cost synergies and rest are so called financial synergies, as we had shown at the time of the BE announcement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe if sort of you can elaborate on how we organize to deliver these synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today the issue is the process to consumer deliver, consumer objective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you confirm these targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 5th of July, EDF took over control over British Energy. On the 9th of January, we announced the new organization, the new management team.  On the 12th of January, Pierre Gadonneix traveled to London to officially inaugurate the brand new company and since then we've been working on an integration program where the goal of -- having reaching the level n minus two of the management line in place within the next couple of weeks and to implement these synergy programs that we've announced.</p>
          <p>And don't forget that this transaction has a second major goal, namely to give us one step -- to enable us to be one step ahead in building new nuclear power. In fact, it is that some our competitors have organized themselves; they have announced that they wanted to get on the market, which confirms that first of all that we &#x2013; it was a good thing for us to take a step ahead and secondly I confirm that we are definitely ahead at least one step, if not more of our competitors, particularly on the four new nuclear plants that are planned.  New question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to get back to your guidance for 2009 &#x20AC;4.3 billion net income at best, of course you are subject to many contingencies we understand.  Could you give us your assumptions for nuclear output and hydropower output you have in mind for 2009?  Secondly, can you confirm under this guidance, you do have a non-zero tariff assumption or tariff increase assumption?  Tell us as well if you're taking into account your purchase accounting on British Energy, could you give us an indication of this amount which probably will not be far negligible?  Fourthly, your net debt expectation at the year end in terms of financial income? You believe that will be a different consensus or a lag in consensus in 2008? Could you comment 2009 and then lastly, can you tell us whether this guidance is before or after disposals? In other words, can potential disposals have an impact, dilutive or otherwise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's many questions. Let's do it in order. On volumes, or rather on assumptions of volumes, hydropower and nuclear power, maybe Jean-Louis can answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On hydropower output, as usual we use an assumption of average output, average investor statistical meaning of the term. Which was the case in 2008, well it's slightly below the average output.  What we've observed today at least the year not starting too bad and in terms of hydropower capacity and output. Good condition, good hydraulic conditions in other terms, which is rare enough and deserves to be emphasized.</p>
          <p>Now in hydropower, per generation and power, some things of course are not under our control but others are perfectly in line in the context of our operational performance program. Already in 2008 we've made considerable progress in the availability factor of our hydropower assets and there will be more expected in 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding the availability of nuclear power, I remind you that 83% kD for 2010 and an 85% target for the kD in 2011. We are fully confident that we can reach this availability factor target.  This year, we've experienced a number of exceptional events similarly to last year. When I say exceptional events, I mean events that concern several reactor units over several years. We haven't seen that type of events for many years and we've experienced several of them at the same time.</p>
          <p>First of all, problems of clogging in our steam generators, issues of installation of alternator status, and at the end of the year another issue emerged and it was since Investors Day in London.  New items have emerged regarding the power gen's former terminals in some plants.  So the impact of these exceptional events on 2008 accounted for 3.8% in terms of kD factor.</p>
          <p>Hence, our personal conviction for 2009 is that on the one hand, we are in a position to significantly reduce the impact of these exceptional events which are currently being dealt with, and on the other hand the measures we've implemented with new system, new mechanisms to properly handle and reduce the duration for the maintenance shutdowns, in addition with a new policy of preventive maintenance, all of which we're fully implemented this year. These should start to bear fruit for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some indication on the debt guidance. The assumption is a constant scope so yes, the assumption is that we give ourselves two years, but the ambition is actually to complete the first disposals quite quickly in 2009; that's our ambition.  But we give ourselves a time line of a maximum of two years for these disposals.  So we're talking here assumptions on the like-for-like basis for in -- organic growth.</p>
          <p>Debt at the year-end we don't communicate on specific figures for segments but I'm sure you have seen that we've also deliberately given you a strong target whereby once we've closed the Constellation, British Energy transactions, we intend to constantly improve the ratios for the company. That is the debt EBITDA ratio and FFO net debt; these are the two key ratios. And if you want two more indications or indicators that clearly we also want to remain among the best in class in the industry; that is clearly our target.  We're not going to carry out any other major acquisitions for the group but there will be a number of disposals Centrica and so on, so five billion and so on.</p>
          <p>So the debt, well &#x2013; British Energy debt is easy -- 13.5 billion, we keep 75% of that amount, so nothing complicated. Constellation is 4.5 billion, the first billions are being repaid at closing, $4.5 billion, we're talking 3.3, that's for cash outflow, part of which is already been recorded in 2008 that is 2.7 billion.  So we're talking that much less for 2009 and deducted from the entire debt.</p>
          <p>Now on CapEx, we always worked on an assumption of that the overall &#x20AC;36 billion over three years was slightly below this year. We'll probably -- we may be slightly higher but this will be the scope.</p>
          <p>Last point on purchase accounting of British Energy, there again we will announce all of this on the 30th of June. We still have some work to do to finalize the figures and release them and publish them to you.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for purchase accounting...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your purchase accounting is taken into account, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morgan, just a follow-up on Emmanuel's question regarding your guidance, could you give us some indication of what you expect your trading business to do?  Obviously it's had a couple of years of very strong growth whether that can be expected to continue?  And also for the EBITDA guidance you give I presume that excludes acquisitions that you make, but how about the recurrent net income does that exclude acquisitions as well?</p>
          <p>At your Capital Markets Day, you said you would be able to give us an update on the cost of new nuclear. You mentioned the higher cost of Flamanville, but can you give us some guidance on where you feel like the price per megawatt-hour is coming out now?  And staying on the issue of nuclear, you mentioned some issues in the discussions with Centrica regarding their acquisition &#x2013; potential acquisition, could you talk about what those might be?  And also just confirm that they're buying a stake in the lake acquisition vehicle and not in British Energy directly?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding trading, maybe you can say a word. Yes, the result of this year is related to the exceptional volatility of markets in 2008.  And we have not asked EDF Trading to maintain the same level on the P&amp;L. We don't want to change anything to our risk policy. This is asset based trading mainly; i.e., it is very likely that if the volatility goes down, EDF Trading next year will be halfway between '07 and <mark type="inaudible" />, since their creation have always done better than budget every year. But the budget is conservative.</p>
          <p>One word about the cost of nuclear. We have indicated in the context of Flamanville a cost of &#x20AC;44 per megawatt-hour and for the next EPR, Penly, of course in this year's rate between 55 and &#x20AC;60 per megawatt-hour, which in fact in relation to the competition this is an excellent position.  Even though it means there's been an increase in relation to what we gave in '05 .  The increase of gas combined cycle or coal-fired plant was more important over the period than the one we announced for nuclear energy.  And these costs are full costs; i.e., they of course include investment, financing, operation and also the decommissioning of power plants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our guidance on EBITDA organic growth clearly relates to the parameter the way it is at the end of 2008 and at the beginning of the year &#x2013; for all EBITDA and net income and obviously any addition is not organic, but parameter extension, both consistently. Yes, the organic growth does not include British Energy, the parameter will add up to British Energy.  Just to finalize, Constellation will only come in in Q4 of next year &#x2013; of this year, as closing is expected in September-October.  So at best we have one quarter of proportional consolidation, 50% of existing nuclear in Q4 to '09.  And the last one, Centrica, I mean issued them just normal negotiation issues.  I mean, we have no fundamental issue with them; it's just like cracking just 500 pages of contracts.  And basically we just brought in G&#xE9;rard Wolf, he is the one who deals the negotiation and talking to Centrica twice a day.  I see at the end of Q1 is soon and we're confident we're getting there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, are you able to say if you're negotiating at all on price, or is it purely the technicalities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no the price is non-negotiating item.  Basically, it is understood that they will enter that joint venture at purchase price, same conditions announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dublis from Gasonov.  Two things, one about nuclear energy in France, you've given specific assumption on kD, do you have any comments on Ku and if demand goes down what about the Ku?  Secondly, regarding Constellation, can you give us an order of magnitude of the JV's EBTIDA for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding kD, Ku, regarding what happened first in '08, the usage rate went from 94.2% to 95.2%, which made up for the one point loss in availability. It is clear that if availability increases substantially, there's no way we can hope for a parallel use of the usage rate but since the tense &#x2013; the equilibrium demand of supply stands, there's no reason to expect a negative evolution of the usage rate. But you understand that the lower the availability, the more there are opportunities to compensate for that.  But for the production co-efficient, kD times Ku, that is going to keep increasing &#x2013; it is going to improve.  Thus the key point last year, we offset one by the other. What we want is to increase the product of the both figures.</p>
          <p>Regarding Constellation, you know that the deal is an asset deal.  We're not buying a full entity with full P&amp;L; we're buying 50% of five power plants. We're building the pro formas. It will be an issue in 2010.  The order of magnitude is between &#x20AC;405 hundred million in proportional consolidation for our part as of 2010.  But it's only a preliminary indication because it is work-in-progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have three questions.  First one, the number which surprises me in the presentation is the 1,058 million of cost of the purchases.  I thought this was mainly compensated by the <mark type="inaudible" />. Could you explain a bit on how you &#x2013; how this assessment declined in EBITDA and on 1,058 million and what's the outlook for 2009 on this item?</p>
          <p>Second, there has been statements from the Nuclear Authority that they would welcome EDF to come in with an application for 30-years in one go and or 20-years life extensions in one go. There was some statements on this.  Is that something you can confirm, so it would not be necessarily a 10-year cycle, but that you could go in one go with a longer application? Is that something you are doing in this case?</p>
          <p>And then the third one, you have said 1.5 billion on British Energy for 2009. This is to me a surprisingly high number.  So I wonder it is for 2009 including the existing Centrica contracts, etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the Safety Agency, we will get an approval for ten years and we will stick to that and it will not be changed, but what we are considering beyond that we'll elaborate with the agency is even though our application will be for 10 years, we can anticipate and prepare 20 years duration. But we must be prepared that there will be a new approval 10 years from now. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have two objectives, first to raise from 30 to 40 years the life cycle.  This year there will be two 30 year visits, trust confident about the result.  The second thing and this was the question asked, is there a mutual interest for the safety agency to know our intentions in terms of life cycle 50-60 years and the interest for us of knowing the agency's requirements; i.e., the investments.  The figure was recorded earlier &#x20AC;400 million on average per plant. That is an absolute value.  This is an average per power plant, over and beyond 40 years, so the time horizons, two different time horizons, that doesn't change the principle of 10-year agreement.  We only have a vision beyond 40 years, at 40 years, 50 years, every time there will be a green light for an extra 10 years.  Regarding the TaRTAM, Jean-Louis, CSPE, it was CSPE.  You have to answer this question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding CSPE, one of the major components or obligations to purchase.  They give rise to compensation in relation to market price.  Since market prices have increased on average in '08, the net effect on obligations is plus &#x20AC;654 million in relation to '07.  In '09, we can anticipate an evolution in the other directions, maybe but there are other factors, maybe related to French Environmental Policy. We might have to create more obligation to purchase and that would partially offset the effect as was just alluded to.  The average price, for last year we had 45-years per megawatt, 69 this year.  More than 54% -- that explains the difference.  As for your last question on Centrica, it is true, it is a preliminary assumption.  In fact, for Centrica they have a closing end of March, so we are changing though, I think our best estimate today is 1.5 billion for a 100% in on annual basis for EDF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to add something, so that we understand ourselves regarding obligations to purchase, the amounts will go down, but they will have no effect on income because we've already hedged the corresponding positions. This is what Jean-Louis was saying.  We have a systematic hedging policy like all of our peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>BNP Paribas, three questions.  Could you give us guidance in terms of net minimum net recurring items?  Regarding the impairment on in Constellation, is that based on the market price end of '08 or the price implied by your own offer on Constellation?  Third point, could you tell us more about Areva's agreement on waste treatment that was announced end of '08?  I think that I heard about a fund. Can that have an impact on your EBITDA or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the guidance on Constellation, we gave you a guidance.  Clearly, when we say it won't increase, it doesn't mean that it will not go down.  This is a guidance we gave you.  This year,  if there was to be a drop, it will be a moderate drop, very moderate drop.  Regarding CEG, we made the impairment on the basis of the intrinsic value detailed in London, $52 per share. That is the value that was accepted as the implicit value accepted by the Board of Constellation.  There is a difference between our acquisition price and $52. Clearly today, the intrinsic value is substantially higher than share price, that's why we're invested. We have signed several agreements with Areva during 2008. One of your question is related to waste treatment.  Bernard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is an agreement relating to a very long period up to 2040.  On the fuel processing and treatment of fuel, the prices for the next four years until 2012 and an agreement on the method in the future, every five years with incentives on the plant productivity, the process and the involvement of EDF in investments made in the Hague. It is a real partnership agreement where we share with Areva the productivity progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two more questions. The four, hence. Analyst from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.  Two questions, one about equity, four billion of mark-to-market, part of which regarding Veolia and Areva, what about the rest three billion? Then a question on your working capital requirement variation, you say minus 2.5 billion and in the press release net 211 million.  What's the difference between the slide and press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the second question, we're going to ask for verification.  Regarding equity, that is a good question. It so happens that our equity, when you look at equity in '06, '07, '08, you see a variation of plus four billion last year and minus four billion this year exactly. Three figures, end of '06, 24.8 billion, end of '07, 28.8 billion plus four billion and we're back to 24.8 billion is statistical coincidence. Here we have a little table telling you about the movements in the two years. Some of them cancel one another. The dividend includes in '07 a down payment 1.5 times the dividend.  This is pure mark-to-market for IAS 39 variation in hedging contracts and portfolio variations go through equity.</p>
          <p>So, first you have net conversion exchange variation.  It is variation of the net position of subsidiaries minus one billion; that is EDF Energy.  The evaluation of the situation in last year, the situation of the pound this year; that is a mechanical effect.  Then you have the variation of assets for sales. Two categories of assets here; first dedicated assets, 8.7 billion today for dedicated.  So when you mention portfolio, you see in this item 1.2, a variation of 1.2 billion.  This is minus 14% whereas <mark type="inaudible" /> was minus 40 and more.  So, we have managed well our mix between shares and bonds.  Even though the total is 1.2 billion and another investments that are also on the basis of mark-to-market. And last category, variations of fair value for hedging contracts, commodity contracts plus 23 one-year minus 1.7 is almost symmetrical, plus four, minus four, you will find all of these figures in the detailed accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is off-mic.  Could there be an additional payment because the asset value was down?  The question had to do with dividends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, says Mr. Camus. We announced the dividend and we'll stick with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I was talking about dedicated assets.  On the long-term, not on the short-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The requirements under the law under on dedicated asset is that we need to have full allowance by 2011.  Now what the markets will be doing until then is anybody's guess, but our rationale is a very long-term investing strategy dedicated assets. They will start in '15, in 2015.  That should take us all the way to 2065 with a 50-year lifespan, and most of us will no longer be on this earth anymore.  So, but technically to answer your question, the answer would be yes, but, yes by a timeline of 2011, in due time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the apparent gap regarding the working capital requirements, Didier Carvez maybe can give you an answer regarding the variation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right.  In the cash flow chart, we have an amount of 211 million.  That corresponds to the working capital change in the books, and what we've shown you is 2.5 difference which is the provision for The Hague.  That was restated, it's a debt provision if you will, non-financial debt or liability at The Hague, it's a liability if you will, but the total of all of that is consistent, or consistent with Pierre Gadonneix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>I have several questions.  This one has to do with asset disposals.  Would that include assets in the U.K. that are required in the context of the acquisition of British Energy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no that would be in addition to or no, we are talking about the 25% Centrica?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No says the speaker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it could be included in the disposal program, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Some of the concession contracts will be come up for renewal in France in 2009.  Electricity concession contracts of what, electricity distribution, we also have concessions for hydraulic dams, you were talking about concession contract for electricity.  What would be the lead goal regime if you will for the renewal of these concession contracts. Will that be automatic renew, will there be competitive bidding?  Second question in nuclear power, if you are investing in order to extend the lifespan of your plant, will you discount some provisions?  In other words, will you write-off some provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously if we extend the lifespan up to 50 to 60 years, then yes.  We would have a significant provision write-off.  It's already been done in the past.  This is something we already had discussed in London. Now, back in 2003 and '04, we extended it from 30 to 40 years.  The entire economic balance of EDF as a company is calculated on the basis of 40-year lifespan for a purpose which is perfectly reasonable. But before 2004, that balance was completed on a period of 30 years, which of course led to significant changes in some of our balance sheet lines naturally.</p>
          <p>Regarding concession contracts, and let's make sure we're taking about the same thing, we have hydraulic concession contracts. The renewal of these contracts will be subject to a bidding procedure, but this will be done gradually over several years, and this is something that we've shown you repeatedly.</p>
          <p>Regarding the supply of distribution, our concession contract at this point, French law similarly to EU directives do not require us to change anything at all. EDF, or rather ERDF now, ERDF and EDF because the distribution concessions are dual contracts.  It covers the grid, the network as well as the supply, the retail supply at regulated rates.  So, the contract is signed jointly by EDF SA and by ERDF as distributor.  And without any doubt, in 2009 the only concession holder is EDF, wherever EDF is already the concession holder.</p>
          <p>And actually, where you have municipal utilities, that will not change, but imagine if you're thinking about the renewal of the Paris concession contract, it will take place in 2009 in the context of current legal system.  Of course they are negotiations naturally.  They are of course negotiations as always in the renewal of the concession contract, but this situation is very specific in these cases that we are the only possible concession holder.  Final question?</p>

          <p>Natixis Securities. Your moderate increase in EBITDA, is it calculated including or excluding the TaRTAM provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so excluding the TaRTAM impact, of course, excluding any non-recurring exceptional extraordinary items. We try to be as consistent as possible and we are consistent says Chairman Gadonneix.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is off-mic. I have a question on the slide about the four million you were talking about earlier. Can we put it up on screen? We are talking about change in shareholders' equity; that's the slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ask your question, sir, that will be the final question no, no. Okay there goes the slide, it's back on screen, so change in shareholders' equity, ask your question, sir. Did you ask for the slide on the screen or you just wanted to read it? Okay. If you want, I can make you a copy, Xerox copy, this is nothing confidential.  It's just to illustrate this. Of course you will find it in the statements, account statements just to make it easier. I'll give you a copy of it if you'd like, sir.  Final question.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Once more, you're saying it's parameter constant, constant parameter, is it also then excluding the debt which is linked to the British Energy, etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We didn't give any guidance to the debt...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I mean that if you exclude it on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's included, it includes the cost of debt of British Energy.</p>
