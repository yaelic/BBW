          <p>Good afternoon. This is Mike M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our Q1 results conference. In order to give you maximum time for your questions, our CFO, Bodo Uebber, will begin with a short introduction, directly followed by Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to hand over to Bodo Uebber.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Ladies and gentlemen, we announced first quarter numbers earlier today and they are again solid numbers. In a challenging and volatile market environment and despite high investment in the future, Daimler delivered the best first quarter revenues and EBIT. Both group sales and revenues increased by 9%. At the group level, we posted EBIT of &#x20AC;2.2 billion from ongoing business. That's an increase of 3% compared to the previous year. Net profit is very satisfying at &#x20AC;1.4 billion, which is 20% higher than Q1 2011. Earnings per share amount to &#x20AC;1.25 versus &#x20AC;0.99 in Q1 over the previous year.</p>
          <p>Industrial free cash flow was a negative &#x20AC;2 billion. This is mainly caused by the seasonal development in working capital. The increase in inventories is related to the filling of the product pipeline that &#x2013; Mercedes-Benz Cars to prepare for the spring selling season and the market launch of new products such as the B-Class, SL or the SUVs.</p>
          <p>Also at Daimler Trucks, we recognized higher inventories at the end of Q1. This increase relates to the order book and the resulting stronger sales in the coming months, particularly in NAFTA and Asia. We also accounted for some Euro V inventories in Brazil, due to the transition phase from Euro III to Euro V. In addition, we had a cash outflows from capital contributions to Engine Holding in connection with the integration of the Bergen business into Tognum and the investment in our Chinese truck joint venture.</p>
          <p>As we continue to invest in our future beyond 2012 in new products, new markets and new technologies, free cash flow was also affected by higher spending in connection with CapEx and R&amp;D. Our net liquidity remains high at &#x20AC;10.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss the performance of our divisions in the first quarter 2012. At Mercedes-Benz Cars, following up on our record sales last year, we are off to a successful start in 2012. To date, we have recorded a new sales record in every month of this year, with sales of 338,000 Mercedes-Benz and smart cars, which had a new high for first quarter sales. And March was the strongest single-sales months in the company's history. Mercedes-Benz Cars posted an EBIT of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, with a return on sales of 8.4%.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, this quarter's earnings were supported by higher sales and currency effects. On the other hand, we incurred a temporarily less-favorable net pricing in China, with some selected imported vehicles. Burdens also resulted from higher expenses from new technologies, new products and additional plant capacity. EBIT was also impacted by the discounting of non-current provisions with lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>In addition to our excellent start this year so far, it is especially the overwhelming customer response to the new models which makes us very confident that we will over &#x2013; that we achieve our goal of posting a new all-time sales record in 2012. In 2012, we will profit from the continuation of strong demand for our models in the C-Class segment. At the end of March, we launched a new version of our iconic SL. We anticipate further growth for our family of SUVs, primarily due to the full availability of the new M-Class and, as of September 2012, of the new GL. In addition, the new generations of the GLK compact SUV and of the G-Class will be launched in June 2012.</p>
          <p>The new models in the high-volume compact car segment will also contribute to growth in unit sales. The new B-Class was launched in November 2011, with the new A-Class to follow this September. Plus, we will bring a completely new automobile concept to the market in September, the CLS Shooting Brake.</p>
          <p>In the coming quarters, we anticipate that business and earnings at Mercedes-Benz Cars will follow the regular seasonal pattern. Daimler Trucks increased sales in the first quarter by 21% to 108,000 units, mainly driven by Trucks NAFTA and Asia. Trucks NAFTA was very successful with 41% growth in unit sales to 33,000 vehicles, and continues to be the market leader in the Class 6 to 8 truck business there. Trucks Asia increased its unit sales by 31% to 43,000 trucks.</p>
          <p>Overall, in the upcome &#x2013; in the coming &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; unit sales of trucks, Europe/Latin America declined by 5% to 31,000 vehicles. This is mainly a function of the introduction of the new emission regulation in Brazil, resulting in 31% lower unit sales.</p>
          <p>In Q1 2012, incoming orders were at the level of unit sales. As of today, our order backlog extends into summer 2012. Daimler Trucks recorded an EBIT of &#x20AC;383 million, which equals a return on sales of 5.2%. Again, all truck business units have made a positive contribution to our solid performance. Positive volume effects were offset by the challenging business environment in Latin America and costs related to our product offensive with the new Actros.</p>
          <p>EBIT was also impacted by the discounting of non-current provisions with lower interest rates. Customer response to the new Actros is good. We are satisfied with the auto volume. With the new Actros, we are able to win over new customers who have not bought Mercedes-Benz truck in many years.</p>
          <p>As expected, the main volume of new Actros is ordered as Euro V version. Still at approximately 25%, the Euro VI share is currently higher than expected. Overall, in the coming quarters, we expect growing unit sales and increasing earnings. Uncertainties persist in connection with the Brazilian market. These are reflected in our new market projections.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to our van business. It again generated very good EBIT of &#x20AC;168 million. Return on sales was 8%. Despite lower sales, a less favorable model mix, entire expenses for R&amp;D, Mercedes-Benz Vans could post stable results. This achievement was mainly the result of lower warranty costs. The new city van, Citan, will be introduced this fall. Overall, we expect a positive sales development in 2012.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses posted a first quarter EBIT of minus &#x20AC;67 million from ongoing business. This EBIT development is a function of season low sales in Q1 2012 and the new emission regulations in Brazil, which resulted in a reluctant sales behavior of many customers.</p>
          <p>To strengthen the competitiveness of the bus business, we have initiated repositioning programs in Europe and North America. These programs will reduce a breakeven level of Daimler Buses. These programs are designed to achieve the targeted 6% return on sales in the coming years.</p>
          <p>GLOBE 2013 will be rolled out at all locations in Europe and along the entire value chain. The costs related to this program amounted to &#x20AC;36 million in the first quarter. We anticipate additional expenses of up to &#x20AC;50 million by year end. Yesterday, we also announced the fundamental repositioning of our bus business in North America called transit. In connection with this initiative, we anticipate expenses of around &#x20AC;60 million. For the fiscal year 2012, Daimler Buses expects unit sales below the previous year's level.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services delivered another strong EBIT performance of &#x20AC;344 million. This positive development was mainly driven by a favorable risk situation and higher contract volume. There were opposing effects on earnings from slightly lower interest margins. So much for current development and our perspectives on our individual businesses.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our outlook. Mercedes-Benz Cars assumes that we will further increase in unit sales this year and grow faster than the market as a whole. We expect our unit sales in each of the remaining quarters of 2012 to be higher than in the prior-year periods. In regional terms, we see further growth opportunities in 2012, above all, in North America as well as in China, India and Russia. Of the smart brand, we expect an ongoing, stable level of unit sales.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks anticipates another rise in unit sales this year. In Europe, we intend to develop better than the market as a whole, thus further extending our market leadership. Our most important model in this respect is the new Actros. Market effects connected with the introduction of stricter emission regulations in Brazil mean that the sales situation there will be difficult, but we expect to maintain our good market position.</p>
          <p>Because of the still very high average age of trucks in the NAFTA region, we anticipate high demands for replacement vehicles and, thus, expect another increase in unit sales in that market. We also anticipate growth in unit sales in Japan, driven by the reconstruction work following the natural disaster.</p>
          <p>Mercedes-Benz Vans anticipates a further increase its unit sales in 2012. The launch of the new Citan in the small van segment will help increase our unit sales in Europe. Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz Vans also expects to sell more vehicles than in the prior year, also in the United States. And we should be able to participate in the positive development of the Latin American markets due to the launch there of the current model generation of the Sprinter.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses anticipates a decrease in unit sales in 2012. We expect weaker demand this year, above all, in Latin America. That's due to the introduction of the Euro V emission regulations in Brazil, which led to purchases being brought forward in 2011. We anticipate a slight recovery of our business with complete buses in Europe.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services expects to achieve growth in contract volume and new business in 2012. A normalization of credit risk is expected and, thus, a moderate increase compared with the low level of the year 2011.</p>
          <p>We assume that Daimler Group's revenue will increase again in the year 2012, following on the heels of significant growth in 2011. We expect to see above-average growth rates in emerging markets and in North America.</p>
          <p>On the basis of current market expectations and the planning of our divisions, we aim for the Daimler Group to achieve EBIT from ongoing business in 2012 that is in the magnitude of the prior year. We have set the following targets for the division's EBIT from the ongoing business: Mercedes-Benz Cars at the prior year level; Daimler Trucks at least at the prior-year level; Mercedes-Benz Vans, same, at least at the prior-year level; Daimler Buses, below the prior-year level; and Daimler Financial Services, slightly below the prior-year level.</p>
          <p>Our targets are based on the assumptions that the economic and political environment, automotive markets and exchange rate environment remains stable. We continue to make progress towards our targeted return rates of 2013 onwards. And ladies and gentlemen, we are an ambitious company. We have defined targets and plans for this year and the years to come. Our group strength, along with the sound strategies defined in each division, will help us to meet our targets.</p>
          <p>We outlined the Mercedes-Benz 2020 strategy at our Division Day in Hungary, and we will present on our truck strategy in more detail to you in the course of the year. And as Dieter Zetsche said in Kecskem&#xE9;t, there's a strong commitment in our entire organization. We know our challenges and are determined to tackle them. We are confident that we have the plans, products and people to get the job done.</p>
          <p>Now I look forward to your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>First in line today is Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I have a couple of questions. First of all, I want to know with regard to the other cost changes. I mean you have said in Mercedes Cars, but also in trucks, you have got the burdens from the discounting on provisions. I would like to have more details with regard to the rest of the other cost changes. So where did that come from? In particular, in cars and trucks, maybe you could quantify that, to which extent that came from higher D&amp;A, higher R&amp;D or the special effect that we have got in trucks and cars related to the ramp up of new product?</p>
          <p>Then the second question that I have is, you still have got a very broad guidance for the market in Europe with regard to trucks. So maybe you could give us some more help if you should expect now rather flat market, or if you should expect the market rather to go to minus 10%.</p>
          <p>And then the last question that I have related to the China joint venture. I mean you had these production breaks in Q1. The China joint venture now was negative in the first quarter. Do you expect here the significant earnings recovered in next two quarters with the normalization of the business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Schneider, for your questions. To your first question, the other costs changes. Of course, first, we have disclosed the burden from the interest &#x2013; lower interest rates on long-term provisioning in our back up in the presentation. I do think you have seen the effects quarter by quarter. I do think it was &#x20AC;89 million in cars and the next &#x2013; the difference of those numbers. And the other bigger stuff was in trucks. We had, of course, as we already in the beginning of the year said, burdens from product launches and plant ramp-ups in the first quarter. We had roughly a &#x20AC;50 million from ramp-up in the cash commit plans. You have clearly also seen the BBAC equity Participation was negative, so the difference was another kind of &#x20AC;50 million. So in total, that was a burden that we had in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With regard to R&amp;D, the same happened, as we clearly announce it also before that we invest in R&amp;D a lot. That burdened, of course, also the cars, so to say &#x2013; and the truck business, but for good reasons because product to come in the next upcoming years.</p>
          <p>We had also, with regard to our sales development, some more logistically costs, for example, in the safety area. And all in all, that came up with that roughly &#x20AC;300 million, which we disclosed in our book. Within trucks, of course, we announced also in the beginning of the year the further launch of the second model, so to say, from the new Actros. The new Actros is currently in the market &#x2013; very well recognized. We have another analysis yesterday in the press about the efficiency of the truck. Now it came up with 9%. You might remember, we discussed 7.9%. So even now, we get higher numbers, based maybe on the engine side of the trucks.</p>
          <p>The burden, as we already said in the beginning of the year, is roughly &#x20AC;300 million for the year, and it is more or less equally spread so it is &#x20AC;75 million in this regard. And that ends up, so to say, in the burdens of the &#x2013; the cost burdens of &#x2013; within trucks. So these as a clarification what happened, as I said before, as we already addressed it in February, as there's no change to what we have said there. I'll...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Then follow up on Mercedes Cars. So also, in the next few quarters, I guess, that we will see in the walk down then some negative impact in the magnitude of minus &#x20AC;150 million to minus &#x20AC;200 million. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to make now a pure guidance on that, of course, which we should see the local and equity development of BBAC, for example, due to the break &#x2013; the production break we had in China. Of course, this will develop further positive. But as we said in the beginning of the year, we have a total burden this year of the content we have in the cars, as we said, the CO2-related measures and the capacity increase over the year. So I don't want to give now guidance for each and every quarter. Finally, it reflects &#x2013; is all incorporated in our EBIT guidance of the total year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to your second question with the &#x2013; with regard to the European market. I would say that the &#x2013; overall, the developments, we had the same guidance in the beginning of the year, 0% to 10%, negatively. Today, after two months of that guidance, I would think we are a little bit more positive in Europe. So today &#x2013; yesterday, Volvo came up with this minus 5%. So we are, so to say, in that bandwidth because you cannot really finally say all the European market is developing. It's really based on the Southern European, for example, development or &#x2013; and also, for example, UK. But from today's point of view, we are a bit more positive in Europe than we were in February.</p>
          <p>So your third question was about BBAC. I do think have already answered this question. Yes, it was negative in the first quarter. But I assume that it will bounce back, due to the &#x2013; yeah, the ongoing production then in Q2/Q3 in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you see in the Chinese &#x2013; China &#x2013; the product or the models produced by the China joint venture, you don't see there any significant demand problem in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have seen in retail a very positive development. So we were over, above &#x2013; the development was very good. And we have to see that many of our models will come to shine during the course of the year. So the B-Class will be introduced. The GLK is produced in the &#x2013; in BBAC, in our joint venture. And that will, certainly &#x2013; also has a positive impact on the retail side of the business and, therefore, also, on the profits and the revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Jochen Gehrke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three quick ones, if I may. First of all, on trucks in Brazil. Could you help us understand the situation in the quarter? We heard from competitors that Euro V prices were put on Euro III levels. What was really the percentage of your sales in the quarter in that market that was still available with Euro III inventory? And then what is currently the development in the market on the price side? Do you see it now possible to push through prices?</p>
          <p>Secondly, more structural on trucks. I think when we look at the last two, three quarters, it's fair to say that we understand the actual situation. But nevertheless, on a total revenue basis, you're now running really very well towards the levels that we had in the past peak situations. Yet, your margin is far away from even the average level. Where do you see yourself now currently, regionally? We understood in the past that this is a &#x2013; this is a very big difference between the various assets. How is Japan progressing now in the first quarter with a good recovery? Can you just update us on that?</p>
          <p>And then on the third question, cash flow, obviously, minus &#x20AC;2 billion, was a negative development in the first quarter. How are the coming quarters progressing because even if I strip out the effect of working capital, it does look like a disappointing cash flow quarter, at least from my perspective. If you could shed some light on this, also, knowing that CapEx activity is more at high end the second half of the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, thank you for your three quick ones, you're raising questions. First, let's talk about Brazil. Mainly, we have &#x2013; I do think in all the other competitors, we have the topic &#x2013; the question, when the customers are ordering or getting the Euro V trucks. So the market is more or less in order. It depends when this demand will, so to say, happen.</p>
          <p>And currently, it's a little bit of a &#x2013; a little bit of a question when the government support can be, so to say, implemented. More or less, the direction is clear. But, of course, as you know, when you get a law or a regulation, you have to implement it. And it has to be done by some authorities and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>When that happens, I do think the market will bounce back, and that might be then happening in the &#x2013; yeah. At the end of the second quarter and third quarter this direction, I do think that this is a common understanding right now. The topic there right now is the &#x2013; is there are some topics in the market, like the availability of the diesel fuel, for example. They're &#x2013; for, they are hesitating to go into Euro V. And the prices for <mark type="ph" /> AdBlues (24:56), for example, which you need, is also pretty high. And again this is government incentive.</p>
          <p>So, by all means, if product is okay, the market, so to say, is okay. I do think the market needs another couple of months to bounce back. And then, of course, we will see also the Euro V upcoming, then revenues, profits and so on and so forth. And that the market gets back, revenues and profits are getting back. The pressure in the market from pricing, of course, Euro III almost nobody has any more Euro III inventories. There might be one &#x2013; maybe one competitor who has somewhat. But what I could read in the disclosure of all the others right now, there's almost no Euro III. So, therefore, it's already done with that current divorce. Maybe a little bit of pricing pressure for Euro III. But of course, that is, so to say, done. That's to the Brazilian situation.</p>
          <p>Your second question was more a broader one, I would say. To Daimler Trucks, the current situation is, I would say, within Freightliner, a very positive one. From a market point of view, of course, we get a lot of tailwinds. So it's a positive market right now to the age of the fleet and the demand coming from that area. Our profits are definitely &#x2013; and returns are heading into the right direction. This is close to our benchmark rates, which we have discussed.</p>
          <p>Fuso was a &#x2013; is doing well, I have to say; also developing well, based also on the good revenue in the first quarter. So, therefore, also pleased with the development. And I'm also pleased with the new Actros, as I already have seen. The market introduction went well. Quality is good. The feedback from the customer is good, so we are doing well in that introduction. But on the other hand, you know we had to account for the costs side; that is as it is. We explained it before, that burden somewhat, of course &#x2013; the first quarter. And Brazil, I have already explained.</p>
          <p>So for the next upcoming quarters, I expect sales development going upwards. And that is, of course &#x2013; that was also based in our plan. We have addressed the weaker or the soft start, if you might say so. Within trucks, I expect that we bounce back on the revenue side and the profitability side over the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Your third question was regard to the cash flow. Again, first quarter has seasonality in &#x2013; from, so to say &#x2013; from the passenger car side, we will sell this stock, so to say, inventories in the second quarter. We expect, as we said, seasonal patterns over the second quarter is a very good one. We have to prepare for that. And, of course, we have some inventories for the M-Class and for the B-Class, logically, because we're on the ramp-up into the markets. We have to fill up the pipelines. On top, of course, we said it also in the Capital Market Day, the investments, of course, so to say has &#x2013; had also their impact.</p>
          <p>On the trucks side, also, we prepared for the upcoming sales in NAFTA and in Asia and in Europe. Europe, again, also we had to prepare for some stocks because you might remember that we had also a production downtime in W&#xF6;rth planned for. So that's &#x2013; I call also as a normal business that we do have here. And we had accounted for the Bergen business, as you know, for &#x20AC;200 million, &#x20AC;50 million for the joint venture in China, which are all included in these numbers.</p>
          <p>So I expect that we deliver our cash flow guidance of the total year, as I explained it also this morning in the press, in this regard that we will be overachieving the dividend from today's point of view, excluding some contribution to pensions, as I addressed it also in the beginning of the year. And this investment into Bergen and the investment into the joint venture in China.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I can just come back on the truck side. You're happy with North America. You seem to be pleased with Japan and Europe &#x2013; okay. But when I put it all together, it gives me 5%. And NAFTA used to be a target about 8%. I think Fuso targeted about 5% and Euro-LatAm was the region that we always understood to be in double digits. Is Euro-LatAm really currently running below the average or close to at the average? Is that the picture that we should understand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, I would be lying if I would tell you we would be over the average. No. Of course, we are. In this regard, as I've said before, we have the cost burden on the Actros launch, as I've said it before. We have, of course, a slow start regarding sales within Europe and Brazil, so to say, that is the piece where it's currently, from a market point of view, difficult, as I've said it before, where the contribution is almost at a very low level. And that is a market-driven topic. And that's &#x2013; I expect this market-driven topic over the quarters, so to say, again, being &#x2013; again, in the normal rates, so to say, we are kind of a little bit waiting for the market. What we do currently is we doing road shows with all products, which are quite successful in Brazil, just to prepare for the time where markets will pick up.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Okay. That's clear. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Okay. Next question we take from Daniel Schwarz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question. The increased inventories for trucks for sales in coming quarters, how &#x2013; does that fit with the weaker oil intake in the first quarter? And in NAFTA the minus 27%, is that in line with your expectation? And how does that develop in the second quarter? And if I understood right, Euro VI represents 25% of your orders in Europe. What's reason for, for [foreign language] or an operator to order Euro VI, beside very low volumes to test it within the fleet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. First of all, the last question, of course, is a good product. And the fuel efficiency, I've mentioned, which you know that it is a big part of the total cost of ownership. A higher share is fuel, and fuel &#x2013; and that means engine. And we get a very good feedback with regard to the engine. And, even as I said before, we have done our own testing. But our own testing has to reflect all other testing. So we used external testing, which were even better than our own testing. Therefore, the product is very good.</p>
          <p>Of course, we had planned for that we do not sell Euro VI, so to say, from the beginning, of course. There are some markets who have already incentives out for Euro VI; Switzerland, for example and &#x2013; but also other ones. We hope that Germany will also go into that. We have some discussions there and hope on the implementation that would accelerate somewhat, of course, here the order intake. But anyway, it's a good product.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; in your questions regarding inventory and order intakes, the current situation is in that very positive. Our order backlog and order intakes and sales finally, in our forecast, covers 70% of the total year. That means, of course, we are in pretty good share right now with our order intakes. You have seen order intakes in Q1 in NAFTA, or Freightliner, compared to last year somewhat lower. But last year was also driven by high fee dollars.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, we have &#x2013; we don't see here an issue &#x2013; I would say pretty positive in the NAFTA and Freightliner. With that order intake, we have currently in our sales development, we need to make it a very good year for Daimler. In the European business, we have a reach, as we did have it always; it's kind of three months. That was not different to February. That is not different today. As I said before, we expect here accelerating sales in the upcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, of course, it's a different business model. We are selling to dealers on stock. And there, as I said before, we have to wait for the &#x2013; kind of that the market is bouncing back with regard to Euro V. That's more or less the situation there.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Rabih Freiha from Exane BNP Paribas. Thank you for taking my question. If I'm correct, during your Capital Markets Day in Hungary, you said that some discounts were being given on the S-Class in China, since the new edition was going to be introduced in April. I was wondering if you'd give us an update about how the phasing is developing, but also on the pricing situation, after this previous edition was discounted. But also maybe a comment on the overall pricing situation there would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your question. As we said it already and Bj&#xF6;rn Scheib I think I answered the question in the Capital Markets Day on the changeover, so to say, from old models to new models in China, imported cars. We are back on track &#x2013; so to say, back on track. Of course, we were pretty much successful with that program, on the other hand. But incentives are reduced again to the levels we had before. So, therefore, it was a clearly targeted program which we had. And we are on track. The overall situation, China accounted for a big piece of that topic in pricing.</p>
          <p>For the year, we are again, as also Dieter Zetsche said in Kecskem&#xE9;t, targeting for a positive net pricing. That is based on new models, as we have said, M-Class, B-Class and also a good market, so to say. And good markets conditions, as we see it currently, in China &#x2013; U.S. is kind of doing well. In Germany, we are according to our plans. So, therefore, we do expect a positive net pricing, although we have this stuff in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Arndt Ellinghorst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, everyone. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. First question is on Mercedes. I saw that you sold quite a &#x2013; yeah, 13%, I think, less Mercedes cars to your dealers in China. And they sold 24% more to end customers. So this inventory reduction, could you share your thoughts, how much of a positive driver from Mercedes in the second quarter this could potentially be? And then, secondly, again on trucks, a couple of things here. I mean, firstly, your incoming orders are 10% lower year-over-year. And they're also 10% lower sequentially from the fourth quarter. At the same time, you need quite a big ramp up of margin contribution from your trucks division for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So isn't there a bit of a risk that if the economy doesn't do as good as we might hope it will be for the rest of the year, that this could endanger your &#x20AC;9 billion profit target for the group? And then secondly, on the Actros, is there a risk &#x2013; or how big is the risk that today, we talk about the launch cost of the Actros and, in a years' time, we talk about the costs from selling the Actros? Because if Europe doesn't do much better &#x2013; I fear that your customers will pay the roughly 10% price increase that you need in order to cover the additional cost of the truck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. So you are right with your assessment in the first stuff with regard to wholesale and retail. So in the second quarter, we should see positive effects from the higher wholesale group sales numbers. And, therefore, also, the &#x2013; as I've said it before, the equity participation profit of our joint venture there should also bounce back to positive numbers. So you are right.</p>
          <p>Your second question with regard to order intake and what makes us positive in this regard. As I've said it before, the difference between February and today in Europe is, from a market point of view, a bit more to the zero as we &#x2013; than less to this minus 10% in this volatility. And, of course, there is risk in that message. When we said, of course, our &#x2013; no doubt, there could be some southern countries developing differently. But in this topic, we are more positive than in February. With Freightliner, our order backlog is a very good one. So we have a very good reach, based on our order intakes we had last year, but also the run rate we're just getting in now.</p>
          <p>We have some fleet orders which are rolling in every month, so they are kind of [foreign language] kind of framework agreements which we have with big fleets. So they are, so to say, more or less fixed and are rolling in, so to say, every month. So there, we are pretty good and kind of a bit better even, that &#x2013; also, that we &#x2013; as we have seen it in February. The difference, what we have here currently is that we might have increased the volatility in Brazil somewhat. And that is, of course, I would say, the kind of negative.</p>
          <p>Putting the positives, as I've said it before, and the negatives together, there's &#x2013; currently, it's a confirmation of our guidance within trucks. I don't see no reason to change it because the underlying order intakes, what we have currently, the customer feedback on the Actros, for example, but also within Freightliner is doing well. Our market shares are pretty strong. So we see currently our product in Freightliner doing very good in market share. We could gain more market share in Fuso again, where we lost over a couple of years. And, as I've said, in Europe, with the Actros, we are doing fine also in market share. The same holds true for Fuso. So putting all the stuff together, guidance, at least at last year, is confirmed and committed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe I should have been a bit more precise. Excuse me for that. My question about the Actros was about the Euro VI Actros and whether there is a risk that sales of the Euro VI Actros are less profitable than sales of the Euro V Actros, moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt, as we discussed &#x2013; and, of course, as once in a while that we have addressed with the &#x20AC;300 million this year with the Actros. And last year, we had the &#x20AC;300 million. Now we had incremental more of the &#x20AC;300 million. So by seeing customer feedback currently and our total cost of ownership advantage, what we do produce here, we don't see the risk that we can &#x2013; that we deliver &#x2013; no &#x2013; do not deliver our benchmark targets, including the Actros for Europe in the upcoming years, so to say. This year, I can't confirm it, of course, because we have the launch. But coming to 2013/2014, of course, we will deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think the Actros is &#x2013; Euro VI is as profitable as the Actros Euro V in a year's time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, as I said before, not in the beginning because we have this launch cost. And secondly, we explained it once that we have the contracts with suppliers, more a &#x2013; contracts which are going through the learning curve. So through the year, that means, of course, you have a burden more in the beginning. And then in the second year, it's better; in the third year is better.</p>
          <p>With that caveat said, you have to look at it totally. We deliver finally, also, the margin-wise towards the old Actros, no doubt. And hopefully, we're getting more market share. And, of course, the aspirational level here is not to be as the old Actros. We would like to gain more market shares and more revenues.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question we take from Kristina Church.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question. I would <mark type="ph" /> save face (41:10) a little bit on Mercedes. Firstly, just on your 10% long-term target. I wondered, is this &#x2013; is this through the cycle target now? And whether the increased costs that you're having to spend for content, what it is that makes you more confident that you can be at a higher place in the future than you have been historically, given that increased spending?</p>
          <p>And then on the spending &#x2013; content spending. Could you just give me a feel for what sort of increase per vehicle you're thinking about? And also where you're looking to in terms of the regulations? Are you &#x2013; at the moment are you spending in order to achieve the 2015 regulations? Or &#x2013; and what is your view on the 2020 regulations in Europe in terms of CO2? And then my final question. Could you just remind me of your percentages, temporary workforce, at the moment, based on a global basis and in Germany? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; thank you for your question. First of all, your 10% &#x2013; question to the 10% target. Yes, this is over the cycle. And that means, of course, it's an average number. Your second question was with regard to the question of content and the question of CO2-related measures, which we have addressed in Kecskem&#xE9;t. So the one answer is, of course, yes, we have a burden. We accounted for that burden in total over five years to &#x20AC;6 billion as a burden over time, which accumulates, so to say.</p>
          <p>And our answer to that burden, as we model our &#x2013; the net zero approach, which we called in Kecskem&#xE9;t, which contents the modular strategy Phase 2. Phase 1 we had already for a couple of years doing, based more or less on reduced architectures. On the one hand, these will be also commercial negotiations, on the other hand &#x2013; and other efficiencies, on the other hand. So we will offset this &#x20AC;6 billion over the time until 2017. We have not disclosed what kind of percentage the one or the other basket is. We have shown in Kecskem&#xE9;t some examples, Wolfgang Bernhard showed us couple of components, of course, where he likes to address some of that stuff. And I do think Thomas Weber showed us in his architectures how he would like to do that. And we gave examples of commonality in the complex car area.</p>
          <p>With regard to your questions with regarding to temporary workers, we have 4,400 temporary workers. That's in the passenger car in &#x2013; sorry to say so? Germany, in total. So I can't give you the number &#x2013; and I'll split it up here &#x2013; but 4,400. But I do think, anyway, the better information might be also what we said, that we can fluctuate with our capacity, so to say, very nicely in cars, up to the 25% and, in trucks, even more. You know that from the past.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 10% margin, is it a net-zero game in terms of costs and the modularity? And yet 10% through the cycle margin isn't something you've ever achieved in the past. Is it just purely through volumes that you will get to that range in the &#x2013; or what am I missing in terms...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are not going only for volume in that regard. As we said, the 10% next years is, of course, is partially is volume. If we &#x2013; we have lined it to the market expectation and other topics, but it's also based on our &#x2013; for example, introducing of new cars. For example, next year, we have the S-Class which is, so to say, on that net zero approach one of the next &#x2013; the new architecture developed. And therefore, of course, we have cost decreases, for example, in the S-Class. And so it's partially, of course. incoming into the year 2013 with a good guy. But as I've said, these are &#x2013; the modular synergy is overall program which is going until 2017, so to say.</p>
