        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christine. And welcome, everyone, to the National Oilwell Varco Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Clay Williams, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30 2009, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including, but not limited, to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.</p>
          <p>No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Form 10-K National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more detailed discussions of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release on our website at www.nov.com, or in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>Later on this call, Pete, Clay, and I will answer your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to two, in order to permit more participation.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it over to Pete for his comments.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Loren, and good morning. As Loren said, I'm Pete Miller, CEO of National Oilwell Varco and welcome to our second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we announced earnings of $220 million, or $0.53 a share on revenue of a little over $3 billion. Included in this result are some unusual charges of approximately $224 million pre-tax, or $0.37 a share. In a moment, Clay will discuss these charges in detail.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we announced new capital orders of $615 million an increase over the $270 million announced in the first quarter. Also, we announced discontinued orders of approximately $100 million to end the quarter with a solid backlog of $8.7 billion. We will also discuss this backlog in greater detail in just a moment.</p>
          <p>We continue to build on a strong balance sheet and position the company to withstand the current challenging times and prepare for the opportunities that the future will ultimately present, In a moment, I'll come back and talk a little bit about the operations and give you a worldwide overview of what we're seeing, but at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Clay to provide more background on our quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pete. As Pete mentioned, National Oilwell Varco did earn $220 million, or $0.53 per share on 3 billion in revenue in its second quarter ended June 30, 2009. Broadly, we saw excellent execution by our Rig Technology group once again in the second quarter, posting sequentially higher margins on lower revenues. However, our second quarter results in both Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, and Distribution Services declined due to falling rig counts and increasingly fierce pricing pressure in North America, partly offset by relative strength and stability in certain of our international markets.</p>
          <p>I will get into these market forces a little more in a moment, but first I'd like to note that our second quarter GAAP results do reflect a number of charges which bear addressing. First, we recognized a $147 million pre-tax, or $0.23 per share after tax, impairment charge on our carrying value of trade names acquired in our Grant Prideco acquisition, which we closed in April of last year. This is a non-cash charge which arises from our retesting of all of our goodwill and intangible assets during the quarter in view of the deterioration in the rig count.</p>
          <p>Second, we recognized $56 million in pre-tax charges related to acquisitions made in the quarter and the results of a voluntary retirement program offered to our long-tenured employees. These totaled $0.09 per share after tax. 10 million of the $56 million of this are transaction charges arising from legal, due diligence, and other costs associated with acquisitions that were previously capitalized under GAAP, but which now must be expensed under FAS 141R.</p>
          <p>The voluntary retirement program charge of $46 million pre-tax is half in cash and half accrued retiree medical expense and option expense. The voluntary retirement program was completed during the quarter and is expected to result in annual savings of approximately $33 million per year. We have broken out the voluntary retirement program costs separately because it is a large, discrete program, in effect for a limited period only, which was specifically approved by our Board of Directors. We do not typically break out other operating, severance, or restructuring charges, other than those specifically related to acquisitions, but I will tell you that these were about $12 million in the second quarter, up from seven million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Third, we recognized $21 million in additional tax provisions related to our reconciliation of our tax return in Norway, which we filed during the second quarter, to our tax accruals. The taxes result from gains on dollar-denominated non-monetary accounts recognizable for tax purposes, when these were translated into kroner in our statutory accounts at the lower kroner FX rates seen in late 2008. This discrete item drove our tax rate from 32% to 37% in the second quarter, impacting it by about $0.05 per share. We expect the rate to drop back into the 32 to 33% range for the reminder of the year and our hedging exposure going forward.</p>
          <p>Excluding these three items, earnings were $376 million, or $0.90 per share, and operating income was $589 million, or 19.6% of sales.</p>
          <p>Consolidated revenues declined 14% sequentially and 13% year over year and operating profit decremental leverage was 28% sequentially and 44% year over year, excluding impairment, transaction and retirement charges, and including a full quarter contribution from Grant Prideco during the second quarter of 2008 on a pro forma combined basis.</p>
          <p>Our Rig Technology backlog declined 10% sequentially to $8.7 billion, as we shipped $1.434 billion out as revenue during Q2, booked $616 million in new orders, and canceled and removed $108 million from the backlog. We expect $2.5 billion of the backlog to flow out as revenue during the second half of 2009, up slightly from our last forecast; $4.7 billion to flow during 2010, and the $1.5 billion balance to flow out in 2011. Currently, 12%, or $1 billion, of our backlog are for land equipment and 88%, or $7.7 billion, are offshore. About 74%, or $6.5 billion, are major offshore newbuild projects and $1.2 billion are offshore replacement and upgrade equipment. Only 8% of the backlog is for the U.S., with the rest going overseas.</p>
          <p>The second quarter backlog cancellation mostly pertains to a semisubmersible package destined for Brazil, for which our customer was unable to secure financing. Concurrent with relieving this from our backlog, we booked a $16 million gain from the down payment. Total cancellations since the late 2008 downturn have been $235 million and total orders have been $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We are encouraged that some of our customers are beginning to see a little thaw in the credit markets and our Q2 bookings include a drillship package for Brazil that finally secured financing, partly with the help of government export finance agencies. In particular, trade finance assistance from Korea, Norway, China, and other countries, are expected to play an increasingly important role in the financing needs of our customers and we are encouraged to see steady, if somewhat slow, progress on this front.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, financing remains the single biggest obstacle between us and new orders, with banks pushing for higher fees, higher interest rates, and higher levels of equity in new projects. Reluctance by majors and NOCs to signup long-term contracts makes securing financing doubly challenging for drilling contractors these days, Brazil notwithstanding.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, we estimate about 4%, or $320 million, of our backlog is at risk for cancellation and continue to assist these troubled customers in their efforts to secure financing or make alternative arrangements to continue the projects. These alternative arrangements do not include reducing the price, by the way. Cash received on these projects totaled $115 million so far, far less than the amounts we have spent on these projects.</p>
          <p>Our order outlook for the remainder of the year is good, but has evolved into a distinctly hockey stick shape. We expect orders from three main sources. First, 11 of the original 12 newbuild rigs launched via letters of intent from Petrobras about a year ago are proceeding in various stages of construction or financing. Half a dozen of these new floaters continue to seek financing and remain unbooked by NOV or its competitors. At this point, we expect to book a portion of these late in the year.</p>
          <p>Second, NOV and its competitors have been working with Petrobras on specifications for another 28 rig equipment sets for floater newbuilds it would like to have constructed in Brazil. While progress has been slow, Petrobras, in both words and actions, is clearly committed to securing more deepwater drilling assets to develop its massive Santos Basin discoveries, and we remain optimistic that tenders will be issued before year-end.</p>
          <p>Third, we are working with other established drillers on a variety of deepwater floater projects for other markets, including West Africa, the Far East, and Arctic locations. All these potential deepwater prospects are in addition to land rig and jackup inquiries for the Middle East, Caspian, and Latin America; platform upgrade opportunities in the North Sea, and wireline equipment worldwide. We don't expect much in the way of orders order from pressure pumping or drilling markets in North America for the foreseeable future, but have had a modest increase in pressure pumping inquiries in international locations.</p>
          <p>On the deepwater rig front, favorable FX movements, lower steel prices, discounts we are offering, and rising price competition from increasingly hungry shipyards are cutting the all-in price of rigs by 15 to 20%. Nevertheless, outside of Brazil, drillers are moving with far less urgency than was the case between 2006 and 2008, given the higher availability of shipyard slots, even as their fleets get another quarter older and another quarter rustier. As a reminder, 74% of the worldwide jackup fleet, and 61% of the worldwide floater fleet are more than 25 years old. Like a lot of baby-boomers, these are approaching retirement.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, execution by our Rig Technology group on our healthy current backlog book remains excellent. Installation and commissioning of new rigs continued extremely well, with five offshore rigs delivered this quarter and 59 offshore rigs delivered so far this cycle, just shy of 10% of the fleet size when all this building started four years ago.</p>
          <p>Our service businesses faced far more challenging market conditions, and were severely impacted by price competition, particularly in North America, where rig counts fell 29% from Q1 in the U.S. and Canada endured an unusually difficult breakup season, witnessing 47% year-over-year rig declines and 73% sequential rig declines. Pricing dropped as much as 30 to 40% across many product lines in North America.</p>
          <p>International markets held up better, with pricing down five to 20% as the rig count inched down about 4%. Nevertheless, our PS&amp;S group was able to post 9% sequential international gains, about half of which came from acquisitions. International Distribution sales dropped following a strong first quarter artificial lift sale into Latin America.</p>
          <p>Many of the consumables we sell through Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies, and Distribution Services are down sharply, as our drilling contractor customers cannibalized idle equipment from stacked rigs rather than place purchase orders with us for new equipment, as they slash operating and capital expenditures in the face of lower day rates. Therefore, current demand for these does not necessarily reflect actual worldwide consumption, and demand should pick up concurrent with a recovery in the rig count.</p>
          <p>We do not see a meaningful recovery in North America this year, but are nevertheless convinced that steep shale gas decline curves and oil prices above $60 are likely to fuel at least to a modest rebound in 2010, provided economic activity doesn't take another leg downward.</p>
          <p>Cost cutting efforts across the company continued through the second quarter, but were not able to offset sharp pricing declines. SG&amp;A declined 10% sequentially, despite three acquisitions flowing in for most of the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we are performing some heavy lifting during this downturn, driving to in-source more through our internal plants to improve absorption, consolidating facilities were needed, pushing cellular manufacturing and lean manufacturing techniques through our manufacturing locations, and executing consolidation opportunities with recent acquisitions. For example, our Rig Technology group has rolled out an initiative to speed order fulfillment by driving more standardized product configurations, and improving process flow through its factories on items such as mud pumps and blowout preventers.</p>
          <p>We also continued to evolve our manufacturing sources to higher productivity plants.</p>
          <p>All this can be disruptive to our operations, but is candidly easier and less risky to accomplish as business slows. We do not believe pricing pressure has stabilized, but we do expect cost cutting initiatives already enacted and underway will help stabilize margins in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our acquisition team has been busy and we are pleased that NOV acquired three companies during the second quarter, including leading manufacturers of wireline and flowline equipment, and a business to complement our solids control operation. We currently have a number of discussions underway with additional acquisition candidates, and hope to close additional transactions later this year.</p>
          <p>In a cyclical business like oilfield services, acquisitions are less risky during a down market than when times are booming, I will stress again that NOV is exceptionally well positioned and well capitalized to execute investment opportunities during this downturn, with nearly $2.3 billion in cash, a $2 billion revolving line of credit, a book of business totaling nearly $9 billion and an awful lot of experience at integrating acquired companies. While 2009 will continue to be a challenging year, we have enormous confidence in the smart, decisive leaders running our businesses and we are grateful for the tremendous job that they do.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our segment operating results. Rig Technology posted revenues of $1.917 billion in the second quarter, a decrease of 13% from the first quarter and flat with the prior year quarter. Operating profit was $536 million, yielding a record operating margin for the group of 28%, due in part to the gains on the canceled semisubmersible package. Excluding this item, margins were 27.2%, down slightly from Q1. Decremental leverage, or flow through, was 25% from the first quarter and 30% sequentially, excluding the cancellation gains.</p>
          <p>Revenue out of backlog of $1.4 billion fell 15% sequentially, as both project revenues and discrete capital unit sales fell proportionally. Aftermarket sales and services, which is about two-thirds offshore and one-third land, declined 3.6% sequentially, and non-backlog capital sales were down 5.6% from the first quarter. Generally, our sense is that most drillers hit the brakes hard in the first quarter, reflectively stopping both new capital expenditures and non-essential operating expenditures, and that these are slowly returning to more normal levels during the second quarter. This is admittedly anecdotal, and time will tell over coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In addition to Brazil, demand for equipment for the Middle East, IPM projects in Mexico, and upgrade projects for North Sea platform cranes and winches remained steady to slightly improving and we are seeing rising interest for equipment for Iraq. Interest in frac equipment for China picked up late in the quarter after a nine-month lull, and wireline equipment demand has remained steady throughout.</p>
          <p>Instrumentation sales and rentals were down with the North American rig count and the completion of a large sale into India in the first quarter. We also secured a significant order on workover rigs for Russia during the second quarter, and are seeing great performance from the first of several new Drake rigs we have sold into the Marcellus Shale and other markets.</p>
          <p>Looking into the third quarter, we expect to see roughly flat Rig Technology revenues at lower margins due to the non-recurrence of the Q2 cancellation gain and a modestly lower aftermarket mix.</p>
          <p>The Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies segment posted revenues of $913 million in the second quarter, down 10% from the first quarter of 2009 and down 27% from the second quarter of 2008. Operating profit was $96 million and operating margins dropped to 10.5%. Sequential leverage or flow-through was 67%. Excluding the acquisition impact, Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies revenues declined 13% sequentially at 55% flow-through, resulting in a more severe margin contraction than we had expected, due to more pricing pressure than forecast in our base business. Year over year, the group saw revenues decline 27% at 60% decremental flow-through.</p>
          <p>Sales and rentals of downhole tools and bits, composite pipe and coiled tubing saw large double-digit declines, while other products were down only modestly from the first quarter to the second. Virtually all products and services posted sequential drops in North America, which declined to less than 50% of the group's mix during the second quarter in the aggregate. However, international sales increased in absolute terms by 10% sequentially, due to strength in Latin America and Europe. Drillpipe sales were roughly flat sequentially, but margins improved on a better mix of premium high torque pipe and lower costs. Sales of other expendables suffered from vigorous cannibalization of equipment by hungry drilling contractors off of their growing stacked rig fleets.</p>
          <p>The seasonal breakup in Canada when road bans go into effect that prohibit movement of heavy rigs during the spring and fall, drove the rig count there down 73%, which led to 46% lower sequential sales in Canada for the PS&amp;S group. We expect only a modest recovery in Q3, led by southeast Saskatchewan and rising interest in the Montney and Horn River shales in B.C.</p>
          <p>Our forecast for Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies points to a modest third quarter decline in revenues. The slight seasonal recovery in Canada and increases in certain international markets will only partly offset lower drillpipe sales and further pricing declines. Margins are expected to remain roughly flat.</p>
          <p>Distribution Services generated $305 million in revenue in the second quarter, down 25% from the first quarter and down 28% from the second quarter of last year. Operating profit was $10 million and margins were 3.3%, representing 15% decremental leverage from the first quarter and 13% from the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>This group has achieved good success over the past few years increasing its international presence, which now accounts for 32% of its sales, but it still derives 68% of its sales from North America, which softened considerably in the second quarter. Given this, we are pleased with the 3.3% margin this group was able to post in the second quarter, which was achieved through diligent attention to costs and efficiency, and achieved in spite of 2 to 3% pricing concessions made across the United States. Overall, North America declined 31%, but international sales fell too, down about 19%, due to weakness in the Far East, where a large rigup job was pushed out to Q3 and low artificial lift sales in Latin America. The group continues to modify its store network to expand coverage of the emerging Marcellus, Haynesville, and south Texas Eagle Ford Shale plays, while also expanding its presence in Brazil, Mexico and Central Asia.</p>
          <p>Looking forward in the third quarter we expect Distribution Services revenues to improve in the mid-single digit range at roughly flat margins, as additional price pressure offsets normal volumetric operating leverage, which has historically run in the 10% range.</p>
          <p>Turning back to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated second quarter income statement, overall revenues declined 14% and gross margins were down 80 basis points from the first quarter to the second. SG&amp;A declined $31 million sequentially, and overall operating profit declined 46%, including impairment, transaction and retirement charges, and declined 18% excluding these.</p>
          <p>Equity income from our unconsolidated joint venture with voestalpine declined $12 million sequentially to $16 million and is expected to continue to fall down to about breakeven levels in Q3, due to lower OCTG pricing and a scheduled mill shutdown in August.</p>
          <p>Other expense on our second quarter income statement was $38 million, which was $2 million higher than the first quarter. Contrary to my guidance last quarter, we again booked substantial foreign exchange charges totaling $29 million in Q2 from two primary sources, Norway and the UK. In Norway, like last quarter, we reversed some overhedged positions related to large multiyear rig construction projects managed through our operations there. In the UK, we saw adverse movements in the pound sterling, which affected both our unhedged operations there, and our new acquisition. As I've noted in the past, given our extensive international operations, we will always have some level of foreign currency exchange volatility.</p>
          <p>Unallocated expense and eliminations on our supplemental schedule, which is pro forma for the Grant Prideco acquisition for all periods, were $53 million in the second quarter, down $22 million sequentially and up $4 million year over year. High second-quarter legal and litigation expenses compared to both periods were offset by lower overhead and incentive compensation accruals in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we expect that Q2 37% tax rate to drop back to the 32 to 33% range for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization was $122 million in the second quarter, and CapEx was $64 million, down $15 million sequentially. We expect 2009 capital expenditures to be in the $320 million range, down about 10% from our prior guidance.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was $689 million in the quarter, excluding transaction, retirement and impairment charges, down 17% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Our June 30, 2009 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $2.5 billion, up $270 million from the first quarter, due mostly the lower accrued taxes and payables and lower customer prepayments. Working capital on this basis equaled 20.5% of annualized revenue, up 16% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>DSOs were up slightly, as the $289 million decline in accounts receivable was more than offset by the $471 million sequential revenue decline. Customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments, and billings in excess of costs less cost in excess of billings was $2 billion at June 30, down $132 million from the prior quarter due to lower customer prepayment accounts.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $414 million, and less second quarter CapEx of $64 million, yielded free cash flow for the quarter of $350 million.</p>
          <p>At this point, let me turn it back to Pete.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clay. At this point, I'd like to make a few comments about our operations and then I'll turn it back over to you guys for whatever questions you might have.</p>
          <p>I think that the overriding theme is going to be cost containment and cost control. We clearly understand what's going on in the marketplace today. As Clay pointed out, we know what's happening in North America, and I would caution everybody that while we think we're at the bottom, the bottom does not mean going up and I think you could very well be looking at fishing along the bottom for a period of time.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing that Clay pointed out is that pricing pressure remains. I think we can mitigate the pricing pressure with the things that we've done on cost containment, but I think to believe that prices won't go down any further is probably a shade naive at this point because that happens in this kind of environment. I hate to throw out the I've-been-in-the-business-for-30-years card, but I'm going to throw out the I've-been-in-the-business-for-30-years card, and whenever we think pricing has hit the bottom, it continues to defy you and go down even further. So, but we believe we're positioned well enough to take care of that.</p>
          <p>There are some green shoots, and I'll talk about those green shoots in just a moment, but first I'd just like to talk a little bit about what we're doing in our operations. In Distribution, I think we continued to control our costs very well, but more importantly we look for novel and new ways to do business. I think we're looking at our most creative and enlightened customers and we're finding out ways that we can help them really modify their logistics chain, while at the same time being able to eke out a profit on our own.</p>
          <p>We're also looking at our suppliers and vendors that we have, and we're looking to develop more long-term relationships and programs that will actually withstand just a downturn like today, but even be very beneficial for us when business does turn around. These guys are doing a great job of finding new ways to do business.</p>
          <p>In our Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies arena, it really, again, is about cost control. We're starting to see some raw material decreases, and I think as we go forward it will be positive, but more importantly, we're really emphasizing the integration of our products. If you look at our downhole tools and Reed-Hycalog, and our ability to be able to talk about the entire bottomhole assembly as opposed to just talking about discrete products.</p>
          <p>While we continue to sell those discrete products, where we're really pushing hard is the integrated products and really aftermarkets support of that. We're doing the same thing in our Brandt operation for solids control, and in our drillpipe operations, between Grant Prideco and Tuboscope, we're offering more and more integrated services that allow our customers to get better control of their costs in the long run.</p>
          <p>In our Rig Technology business, it's really about executing the backlog that we currently have and I think as you saw the results for this quarter, they're doing a very good job on that. But it's also about new products. Clay mentioned the Drake rig: the Drake rig has had a very successful run up in the Marcellus. We're going to be building more of those; it really is a rig that has a worldwide application, as you look at shale plays around the world. I'll talk about those in just a second but we're excited about our ability to do certain things.</p>
          <p>I think also the other thing you'll see out of the Rig Technology group will be an increase in the business of rig refurbishments and enhancements. We're already seeing discrete sales of pipe handling systems to go on rigs that don't have them. In the North Sea, you're seeing a lot of refurbishments for some of the older rigs that are up there. So we continue to see some very good business that's going to come out of that.</p>
          <p>Now let me just look a little bit in the international arena and talk where we do see some green shoots. As Clay mentioned, in Russia, we sold some workover rigs this quarter; that's the first sale in there for a period of time, and I think you'll &#x2013; while I don't believe Russia is going to explode with business, I think over the next few years you'll see a steadily rising business, and that seems to be substantiated by some of the other oil service companies that are doing business in there.</p>
          <p>One area that's very exciting today, of course, is the Middle East. I think we continue to see an improvement in our operations there; just this morning, we took an order for a land rig in the Middle East for about $16 million. So that's a good way to start a conference call, I got that about ten minutes before we cranked up. And we're starting to see that, I think, in places like Oman, Kuwait, Saudi and the UAE. I would expect over the next couple of years or so for all of those to be very vibrant places. I think Iraq will ultimately awaken a little bit. Some of our customers have started moving equipment in there now. We'll be supporting that and it will be our equipment that's going in, so we think while it may not explode &#x2013; and I don't mean that in a bad way; it may not top as much as we might like initially &#x2013; I think in the long term that's going to be a great play.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, as you've seen with many of the service companies, you have the IPMs that are going on down there; not only are the service companies there, but you'll start to see some indigenous companies that will become involved in those IPMs. As that happens, we're positioned with both manufacturing and distribution and downhole tool support down there to be able to take care of that for a lot of folks. I won't talk too much about Brazil. I'm sure we'll get some questions on that, but obviously that's an area I think for the entire oil field to be very excited about. I think the things that Petrobras and the other Brazilian companies have in line are going to be very positive as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The North Sea, again, I mentioned that earlier. We're seeing some refurbishments there that I think are positive for our businesses, and we'll continue to see some action there. I think in the region out of Continental Shelf is going little bit further north, and some of the other areas west of Shetlands you'll probably see some improvement in operations there. Overall in the international arena, we feel pretty positive, and especially considering what you're seeing in North America.</p>
          <p>And while we expect not much to happen in North America, you'll probably see a rig count increase in the Canadian area just because of the time of the year, but I think to see any big bounce there's really too many variables that are out there, the primary one being what's going to happen to the general economic environment. We've had probably the coolest summer in almost 10 years, and without the economic improvement too, I think the demand for natural gas is going to be lacking for period of time.</p>
          <p>Talk just a second on the backlog. Clay pointed out what was in there. I think one of the more interesting things, too, as we go forward, we'll probably see a little bit more inclusion of things like FPSOs and well intervention vessels, and we're still very, very optimistic on our opportunities to add to the backlog as we go through the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>On our acquisition philosophy right now, we've got a very strong balance sheet and I think our philosophy is really carpe diem. We have to take a look at what's going to be out there and we've got the capability of being able to seize the moment. And if we do that, one of the more interesting things is as you come out of the downturn with the acquisitions that we're able make, it really gives us much greater acceleration of profitability and revenues as we go to the future.</p>
          <p>So overall, a tough environment today, but I have to thank the people of this company for the hard work, their dedication, their commitment to our new products, and I think we're going to weather the storm as well as anybody can possibly weather it.</p>
          <p>So at this point, Christine, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any questions that our listeners might have.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes Roger Read from Natexis Bleichroeder. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Brazilian awards would be the most interesting thing to us. We understand the story with, the ones that are continuing to look for financing, but the incremental 28 orders from Petrobras, give us an idea of exactly how involved, to the extent you can, you are in terms of negotiations with them financing opportunities. Would that be strictly Brazilian-built rigs or does this also include the greater rig-owning public out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Roger, obviously a lot of effort going into that, and just to fill in the rest of the picture, about this time last year Petrobras started off by saying they needed 40 rigs, and soon thereafter issued letters of intent for 12, and so these are the incremental 28. Everything that Petrobras has said and done since that point has indicated that they, I think, are very serious and committed to putting those rigs in place. We have since then seen a big meltdown, obviously, in the credit markets, which has gotten in the way of lot of people's plans, but nevertheless, have worked closely with that customer on developing technical specifications for those rigs.</p>
          <p>Along the way, I think they have been under some pressure to build many, perhaps most, of these rigs in-country, in Brazil, and I think that candidly has probably slowed us both down a little bit in terms of actually winning orders for these. They're still wrestling with that issue. It's clear to us, though, that they want a significant amount of work done in Brazil by the shipyards.</p>
          <p>We, as you know, have a large operation in Brazil; we have close to 700 employees but we don't manufacture necessarily a lot of our drilling equipment there. We think that most of the in-country construction work that's going to be done is going to be performed by the shipyards with regards to the hulls. And so we are optimistic that tenders are going to start flowing later this year, and that hopefully some of these 28 drilling equipment packages show up in our backlog, and that's certainly part of our booking plans and an important part of our achieving the 3 to $4 billion in orders that we think we're going to get this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my unrelated follow-up, PS&amp;S, obviously lot of different pricing international versus North America. I know, Pete, you said it's tough to predict where pricing goes, but as you look in the international arena based on some of the things you talked about, the IPM projects, et cetera, are you under the impression that pricing is at least moderating its declines internationally, if not, finding a bottom, or that if, let's say oil stays on the level it's been in &#x2013; maybe we've seen all the pricing declines we'll see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Roger, that's a fair statement. I believe that we probably are moderating in the decline. The other thing is that we're also catching up in the cost containment arena, and so the two work together. So I'm not sure that you'll see really a much of a decline in the actual margins that we see, and I think we're, hopefully, will be pretty flattish at this point, but you will continue to see people put pressure on the pricing. That pretty much goes without saying in this industry. But again, when you first go into a downturn, it takes you a little while to catch up on the cost containment side, but once you catch up on the cost containment side, you can help to mitigate the issue. So I think we ought to be flattish on the margin side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fact that a lot of the work done in international markets, too, are done on longer term contracts, and so you have less pricing on spot generally. So I think that's helped mitigate the pricing pressures here in this downturn.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Pete, with regard to trying to get a grip on normalized orders, if you will, if there is such a thing in this environment, but as we're &#x2013; cascading here along the bottom, as you referred to earlier, one drillship package and then a series of additional opportunities in inbound orders yields, call it something slightly north of $600 million. Is that how we should be thinking about normalized orders in this environment going forward, one big package, coupled with the usual assortment of this, that and the other, yields something along the lines of $600 million in orders per quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first off, when you say normalized orders, I'm just sitting here smiling, because I'm not sure I've ever figured out what normalized orders were. But as we take a look at this, Bill, and we dissect it internally, if you look at this quarter, you had 600-plus with one fairly significant drillship in there. That leaves you with about 350, and that 350 probably is a reasonable normalization, given where we are today, and that 350 just includes a bunch of stuff &#x2013; new cranes, new top drives, new pipe handling. And presuming that that stuff is a go-forward type deal, and then you start adding in a couple of land rigs here and there that are project oriented, and then you start looking at what we believe are going to be some of the floaters and different things that are coming out, that really does push you to a little bit different number. So you've got the 350 plus, plus, plus, and that's really what we're banking on as we go through the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's helpful. Secondly, with regard to the order guidance of 3 to $4 billion, I'm wondering if a better way to look at this, as opposed to getting hung up on 3 to $4 billion this year &#x2013; because so much is contingent upon timing, financing, et cetera &#x2013; is really to think about Petrobras' needs going forward, and the fact that you guys seem to persist in thinking that that clearly is going to get done, or have a high level confidence in doing so, and whether or not these orders manifest themselves within the next two quarters or the next three to four quarters, it doesn't really matter, ultimately; the business is going to be there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bill, I couldn't have said it any better myself. At the end of the day, we have to have an arbitrary cutoff, and we've talked about this a lot, and our backlog cuts off on first of July. And it will cut off on the first of October, and if an order comes in anytime after that, while we love it, we have to report the cutoff date. Short of reporting a backlog every day, which, quite frankly, we're not going to do, it's impossible, when you take a look at the timing. We're making our best guess and we're hoping like heck these things fall in.</p>
          <p>But I think the way you put it, it is very well done. The fact of the matter is this stuff is going to get done. Petrobras has to have these rigs, whether they order them in the next three months or the next six months, in the long term it isn't going to impact us that greatly as we go forward into 2010 and 2011, but it will impact the future very well. So we're going to continue to try to give you guidance as best we can on when the orders will come in, but rest assured they will come in, and rest assured they will be there in the future. Whether or not they make it by the first of October or the first of November or the first of December, we're pushing hard to get that done, but the fact is, they will come.</p>

          <p>The next question comes for Jim Crandell from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Pete and Clay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. First question is to go back to Brazil. It struck me that during the quarter, that Odebrecht announced that they had gotten financing for two of the rigs in Brazil, and then one other of those rigs changed ownership during the quarter. Were those rigs in your backlog before this quarter took place, or are those still hanging out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jim, we're already probably deeper into talking about specific projects than either Pete or I are comfortable doing, so we have long tried to stay away from talking about specific projects and specific customers. I think the big picture here &#x2013; and I appreciate you pointing this out &#x2013; is that there has been progress made on the financing front. A lot of hard work has gone into these things by these drilling contractors and our own people, good support efforts from the various trade export finance agencies around the world, and so we're seeing some progress on that front. But we did, as we mentioned, win one large drillship package in the quarter from one of those customers who was able to secure financing in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So to go to a more general question, can you see deepwater newbuild orders the balance of this calendar year, ex-Brazil, and if so, do you think that they were more likely to come from India or China, other NOCs or IOCs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you will see some more. I think that clearly, we all talk about Brazil an awful lot because that's the elephant in the room, but fact of the matter is that we're talking to other folks today about things like Arctic rigs. We're talking about rigs for the West African area, for Southeast Asia, and we continue to do that.</p>
          <p>And it's a combination of folks that do that. We're talking to regular international drilling contractors, we're talking to IOCs and we're talking to NOCs; it really is across the board. You're talking to different shipyards, whether you're talking to shipyards in China or some of the bigger shipyards in Korea. We're talking to shipyards in the Middle East about some of these things. So it really is a little bit more than just the Brazilian operation, I know that, again, we talk about Brazil a lot, but I think we pretty much have to. But fact is that there's a lot of excitement in other areas that maybe won't manifest themselves in the next quarter, but they'll certainly come across over the next six to 12 months</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everybody's running into the same problem, which right now there's only roughly 70 rigs in the world that can drill in 6,000-foot waters. These are very scarce resources, and Petrobras, with the Santos Basin discovery, obviously has very large rig needs, but they're not the only ones. There's a lot of frontier deepwater basins out there left to be explored and developed, and so the fundamental driver here is very, very solid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are &#x2013; there are some reputable drilling contractors out with fifth- or sixth-generation rigs being constructed that are available going forward. And so, your discussions with IOCs relative to potential new rig orders, are they more specific, in that they are looking for more specialized rigs, or why would they want a newbuild versus if they could get one that's coming on that's currently available, let's say, in the first half of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a lot of what you see out there, Jim, is very much project specific, but also what you have is a lot people that want a rig designed exactly to their specifications, and they're going to go out and they're going push hard to get it. But a lot of it is very much project specific: it might need a couple of things there that some of the existing rigs don't have. I think it points out something that I've talked about for a long time, a rig is not necessarily a rig. People have a tendency to look at the rig number in the aggregate when, in fact, the rig capabilities on a lot of these rigs differ very, very greatly. Even on the -- when someone says, well, I've got a 6,000 foot water depth rig, they're not all quite the same. So that's why you continue to see the interest in these very, very discrete projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one final question, Pete, if I could. To the extent that this Globetrotter design catches on with maybe Noble and others in the customer base, how does that impact your potential for rig equipment orders on a per rig basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Jim, the Globetrotter's a rig that we'll put a lot of equipment on, and we'll be watching it very, very closely. I will tell you this: we've been in the rig design business for a long time. We like what we offer our customers. I think the numbers pretty well indicate that our customers like what we offer our customers. There's always going to be new stuff out there, and we watch it closely, and we'll participate with it as best we can, but I don't think it's going to abrogate the need for the type of rigs that we're building right now.</p>

          <p>Morning, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to touch a little bit on the non-Petrobras side of your Rig Tech quarter for that. Pete, you mentioned a little bit of inherent strength in there, that 350 million figure on frames, top drives, hammock systems, et cetera. Can you comment a little bit about your incremental outlook on the jackup side? I assume there were no jackup packages booked this quarter, but you referenced the age of the jackup fleet and moving into a refurb scenario, but can you just comment on incremental opportunity sets that's you're seeing out there on the jackup side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we &#x2013; that is correct, Joe. We didn't have any jackup packages booked in Q2, probably worth noting, I think every quarter up until this year we've had jackup packages, even though much of the build book that's been underway for the past few years remains uncontracted. Since the quarter closed, though, we've had a little movement on jackup front and we have a couple of others, folks that we're talking to. So it' not dead out there with regards to jackups</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Joe, I continue to believe that the jackup business is one that, while it may be a little oversupplied at a point in time, I think what you're going to see is a replacement in the type of jackup rigs that people are demanding. You're seeing that they're continuing to find work for a lot of the newer jackups, and we've been on the jackup retooling theory for quite some time, and that's not something that's going to die anytime soon. I think that's clearly going to be something into the future that will be positive for us</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of your, on the Rig Tech side, for walk-up work that doesn't fall into backlog revenues, not out of backlog, Clay, you intimated there, you commented that maybe a little bit more softness on the aftermarket side, a lower aftermarket mix sequentially. Broadly speaking, are we seeing some stabilization here in the aftermarket work over the next couple of quarters and looking at 2010? Are the purse-strings loosening in doing ancillary service work? Is this stabilizing? Do you see this bleeding a little bit further back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so, Joe, and I referenced this in our comments, but our sense is is that when we got into the first quarter, you saw plummeting dayrates and just a lot of &#x2013; a very dark outlook for the global economy, broadly and a slowing down of economic activity. A lot of our drilling contractor customers put out edicts: stop spending &#x2013; stop spending OpEx, stop spending CapEx &#x2013; and that affected both our order book for new capital equipment orders along with spare parts and services, and other things that we sell, which show up on their P&amp;L as operating expenditures.</p>
          <p>As we moved through the quarter, we think we're starting to see a little bit of improvement there, even though our outlook calls for aftermarket to be down a little bit in Q3, it has stabilized. I think our Q1 number &#x2013; I don't recall the precise number, but it was down on the order of 18 or 20%, and this quarter was down about another 4%. We're calling for another little slide in Q3, but we think that we're finding a level of bottom here.</p>
          <p>We also know, more so on the PS&amp;S side but this probably extends to Rig as well, that a lot of these customers are getting very energetic about pulling equipment off of stacked rigs and redeploying it on rigs that are working in order to avoid expenditures here in the short run. And that works so long as rig count didn't go up, but once it starts move up, before those rigs can go back to work, those drilling contractors have to spend money to re-outfit them with spare parts and consumables. So we think that's entering into the fray here as well.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Collin Gerry from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Collin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a bigger picture question. The latest Reed census, I think it showed about 3,000 rigs in the U.S., if my figures are correct. What's your sense on what percentage of those really don't come back into the rig market when eventually the rig count does start moving up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Collin, I get in trouble with all my customers whenever I opine on this. So I would tell you this: I think it's pretty evident out there today that the rigs that are continuing to work and the rig that the operators want are the best technological rigs. Take a look at who has the highest rig counts and where they're going. And I think you'll continue to see that the contractors are going to want to upgrade their rigs as best they possibly can, simply because that's what the operator is demanding. We've always said that contractors don't retire rigs, operators do, and I think a lot of the rigs that are stacked out today won't see the light of day again. Now, if one of my customers said, well, that's wrong, then I would agree with my customer. However, I stand by where I am right now. I think that it's pretty clear that the industry wants upgraded rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Collin, I'll approach the question from the other angle, which is how many of those are new AC powered, electronic controlled, quick-move rigs and we think that number is about 450 that have been added over this latest build cycle. There's probably another 350, maybe 400 rigs that are new, but they're older designs and don't really incorporate the modern technology that makes those new rigs so much more efficient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Another bigger picture question. Last quarter we talked about a lot of projects being shovel-ready. Oil's picked up here, obviously. Do you get the sense that we're at a point where you start seeing a lot of the international work getting underway, and I'm thinking of it in the context, Schlumberger the other day, was saying that it's really going to hinge on where oil prices end the year, and that 70 might be the right target to look at. How do you see things playing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that 70 would certainly be a right target. Here's the problem, Collin, I think that it's not so much what the price is at a point in time, it's what the expectation level is. And it's not dissimilar to stocks. You guys know a lot about how you pick stocks, and it's not about necessarily what you've done in the last 20 minutes; it's about what you expect over the next year. I think that the determination on project go-forward is really somebody sitting back and saying, okay, I'm looking at the economy. I think we're seeing some green shoots. I think the economy is going to improve. If the economy improves, ergo you're going to need more energy, ergo the price of oil will probably go up.</p>
          <p>I think that's got to be the calculation that you make as opposed to whether or not oil is $70 on a certain day. Oil was $70 about a month ago and we're in the 60's now, and if it goes back up to 70, clearly that's positive for projects. But I think it really has to be what is your expectation on the go-forward, and if your expectation is that the economy isn't going to improve and that the oil prices aren't going to go up, you're probably going to be hesitant to go forward with things. So, that's the way we see it, and until there's some more clarity on that, you won't see people pull the trigger quite as rapidly as they have in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like the underlying theme there might be stability in oil prices and the direction might be more important than the spot number where we are right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, but if you can ever define stability in oil price, give me a shout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Last question for me, on the technology front. It's been a while since we got a status update on IntelliServ. Maybe give us what's the latest developments there and where in the stages we are in developing that product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah technically IntelliServ continues to perform very, very well. It was actually down just a shade in Q2 from Q1, like everything else in the oilfield. It's in projects that it was &#x2013; we were queued up to run that technology on, move out to the right and run into some delays, but the technical performance remains very, very strong.</p>
          <p>For anyone listening not aware, IntelliServ is the wired, proprietary wired drillpipe that is, effectively offers broadband from the rig down to the bottom of the hole and is a real step change in terms of data communications with what's happening downhole, and we're very, very excited about it. We're pleased that the early adopters of this technology, which includes a handful of major IOCs and NOCs, are coming back for a lot of repeat business, and so our order book reflects satisfied customers coming back and deploying it on new projects. And so we feel pretty good about the outlook for the business.</p>
          <p>We did announce a few months ago, we'd entered into an agreements with Schlumberger on a joint venture: they're going to buy into a ownership position in IntelliServ, and we have not yet closed that, but we do expect to close that sometime in the next few weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great I'll turn it back. Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Collin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>There's time for one last question. The final question comes from Geoff Kieburtz from Weeden. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Pete, last quarter you said you thought that we'd get $3 billion worth of orders this year with a little bit of luck. How would you characterize your opinion, or probabilities, on that outcome today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we're still there. As Clay pointed out in a lot of his comments, and I followed up on a little bit on later, Geoff, it's more of a hockey stick, but that's to be expected. I think as you go into an environment like this, two years ago, we were closing deals pretty quickly because everything was moving so rapidly. Today, there's a lot more conversation around contracts, prepays, dotting the I's and crossing the Ts, and what might have come to fruition very quickly in the past is taking a little bit more time today. One of the things that's nice for us is we've great visibility into market. We're talking to our customers. We know what's the size project and what's not, and the consequence of that is we're pretty confident. The only real question becomes one of timing and how quickly can you get the deal closed, as opposed to the way you've done it in the past. So we're still optimistic about our projections on that, Geoff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so your &#x2013; if you had given us a probability three months ago, your number today would be unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Right, yeah, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, you mentioned that the backlog we may see orders coming into the NOV backlog over the next few quarters that are not rigs; I think you mentioned FPSOs and some other stuff. How much of the current backlog is not rigs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About three-fourths of the backlog, Geoff, $6.5 billion, are major newbuild rig projects. The remaining, it's actually relatively &#x2013; I'm not sure how to characterize it, because it's not necessarily whole rigs, but it's a lot of rig equipment. I think what you're driving towards is non-rig equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and that's &#x2013; a little bit of a guess here, but it may be on the order of $0.5 billion or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's a very small number as a percentage, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just last question, since I have the opportunity. How do you expect your pricing on new orders over, say, the next 18 months &#x2013; or maybe more importantly, how do you expect margins on orders that you take in the next 18 months to compare with what you're producing today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they'll probably be, on the capital side you're liable to see a little bit of movement downward, but I don't think it's going to be anything that &#x2013; clearly, when you're doing capital equipment, it's not like the PS&amp;S or the Distribution business. We're not going to build capital equipment for practice. If we're going to build it, we're going to build it to make a profit. And most, almost all of the capital that we do, Geoff, is done to order. It's not done to inventory. So if we take an order, we're going to make sure that the potential of making a decent margin on it.</p>
          <p>When we sell something, we sell it one time. It's not some cost where we can rent it now for the next 10 years. So we, while certainly there will be some pricing pressure, it's nothing like you're seeing in some of the day-to-day type businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're also, as we mentioned on our prior comments, we're using this opportunity to reduce our costs and to become more efficient. We've also been helped out by a stronger U.S. dollar than where we saw the dollar through much of '07 and '08. So that gives us a little more latitude on that front too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Geoff.</p>
