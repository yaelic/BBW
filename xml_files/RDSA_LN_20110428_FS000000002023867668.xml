          <p>Thank you for holding, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q1 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce the host Mr. Simon Henry. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Royal Dutch Shell's first quarter 2011 results presentation. First the disclaimer statement. I'll now take you through the results and leave plenty of time for your questions.</p>
          <p>Our CCS earnings, current cost of supplies excluding identified items were $6.3 billion in the first quarter. That was an earnings per share increase of 29% compared with the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our earnings have increased from year ago levels in both the upstream and the downstream. The results in the quarter really are a snapshot of our delivery on strategy, our focus on improving near-term performance and on delivering profitable growth in the medium and longer term. With announced new asset sales and cost saving programs, all part of the focus on continuous improvement and helps enhance profitability and performance. We sold $3.2 billion of non-core assets in the quarter. Further disposals in hand.</p>
          <p>We're delivering the growth projects that we've launched over the past few years. This drives the growth to 2012 and it's clear we're working on new options for the next wave of investment for the growth to 2014 and beyond.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we started production at two new projects, Schoonebeek Heavy oil project in the Netherlands and Qatargas 4 LNG project in Qatar, which together would add 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Shell when they are both at their peak production.</p>
          <p>We continue to crystallize new investment options for the medium term and exploration success and enter into the Chevron operated Wheatstone LNG project in Australia.</p>
          <p>For the next wave of growth to 2020 we have over 30 new projects on the drawing board at the moment, which will generate new options for growth in that period. So we're making good progress against our target to deliver a more competitive performance from Shell.</p>
          <p>So let me move to a few more details on the result starting with the macro. If you look at the overall macro picture compared to the first quarter a year ago, oil prices and our gas realization increased. However, the spread between oil and natural gas realizations remains relatively wide and North American gas prices actually declined.</p>
          <p>Chemical margins increased in most regions against first quarter last year although with lower margins in Asia and we had a mixed refining environment. Industry margins declined in Europe, and the U.S. Gulf coast and increased in Asia and the U.S. West Coast. However, our own refinery configuration delivered increased margins in the U.S., broadly similar margins in Europe and a decline in Asia.</p>
          <p>We've updated the industrial refinery margin trackers that we show you for the U.S. Gulf Coast and for Europe in the results announcements that we made today. These changes reflect the declining availability of the pure Brent crude and market discrepancies in WTS West Texas Sour prices.</p>
          <p>We switched to margins based on dated Brent which is a blend of North Sea crude rather than that pure Brent price for the European refining margins and we've switched to a <mark type="ph" /> mass (4:10) coking margins for the Gulf Coast rather than WTS.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our earnings. The headline CCS earnings of $6.9 billion for the quarter included identified items of $0.6 billion. The CCS earnings excluding identified items was $6.3 billion, the clean earnings.  The underlying EPS increased by 29%.</p>
          <p>The cash flow from operations generated in the quarter was $8.6 billion or $13.1 billion if we exclude working capital movements. And the dividend for the quarter is $0.42 per share as we have previously indicated.</p>
          <p>We are offering a scrip dividend program for the first quarter of 2011 where eligible shareholders can take the dividend as new shares. All the information for that of course is on our website.</p>
          <p>The quarter saw higher earnings in both upstream and downstream. So let me talk about the business performance in a bit more detail. Firstly, the upstream. Excluding identified items, the upstream earnings increased by 8% to $4.6 billion in the first quarter and that compares with the first quarter last year. The main drivers in these results were higher oil and gas prices and higher dividends from an LNG joint venture. These postives were partly offset by increases in costs relating to the start up of new projects, increased feasibility study cost and higher taxes. Earnings were also impacted by weaker natural gas trading results, divestments and maintenance downtime.</p>
          <p>Upstream production at 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and that declined year-on-year by a headline of 3%. We saw reduced demand for gas in the quarter some 50,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. We had 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of maintenance downtime impacts. And the divestments had an impact of 85,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, the underlying performance were better and volumes were flat on year ago levels excluding only the impact of the asset sales.</p>
          <p>LNG volumes increased by 4% to 4.4 million tonnes reflecting higher volumes from Nigeria and the start up in Qatar and production overall from new fields and field ramp up was around 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than it was a year ago and that more than offset the underlying field declines at around 160,000 barrels a day. All reflecting the medium-term plan for production and cash flow growth where the key targets are of course next year 2012.</p>
          <p>As you know, and will know, the UK government announced during the quarter a tax increase for the upstream. That is a negative impact of some $60 million from this in our first quarter results on a clean basis. To give you an idea of the forward impact at current oil prices we're expecting a further $150 million charge for the rest of 2011, and then an increase to around $100 million per quarter for 2012. In addition to these charges, we're expecting to take a one off $500 million charge for the tax change relating to the deferred tax provision on abandonment cost once the legislation is actually enacted. We think that's most likely in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the downstream. Excluding identified items, the downstream CCS earnings increased substantially from first quarter last year to some $1.7 billion. Refining made a small profit compared to the year ago losses. That was the first profit for a couple of years. Refining earnings also improved from the fourth quarter of 2010 where we had impacts that we advised from the downturn from the catalytic crackers at Port Arthur in the U.S. and Pernis in the Netherlands, and both these came back on line during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And for the second quarter, we do expect refinery availability to be lower than it actually was in the first quarter and that's due to plant turnaround activity in both Europe and North America. That's just normal turnaround.</p>
          <p>The first quarter marketing earnings increased from year ago levels. It was driven by higher trading and lubricants results. Albeit these were offset partly by lower retail figures where of course higher oil prices due tend to reduce margins as the price goes up.</p>
          <p>Chemical earnings increased from year ago levels underpinned by higher margins and volumes. However, we did start to see the impact of weaker industry margins in Asia and maintenance downtime at our own Bukom chemicals facility in Singapore and that maintenance downtime will continue for most of the second quarter. So those are the earnings. I'll turn to the cash flow.</p>
          <p>Cash generation on a rolling basis, a 12 month rolling basis was $46 billion. That includes $10 billion of disposal proceeds and over that period the Brent oil price averaged $87. This combined with the ongoing capital spending program. This resulted in a slight reduction in the balance sheet gearing in the quarter to 14% and that compares with the 17% we saw at the end of 2010. And also it fits very well in the 0% to 30% range that we look out for the company in the overall financial framework.</p>
          <p>I should update you that we expect to complete the Raizan joint venture. That's the sugar, ethanol, downstream marketing joint venture in Brazil, expect to complete sometime in the second quarter 2011. When we do that we will recognize $1.6 billion as capital investment. You will see that then flow through as cash out around $600 million on completion. That's the first of three payments over the next couple of years. So we don't see all the cash go out immediately.</p>
          <p>We will continue to watch the cash position and the balance sheet very careful, and I'm pleased to see this quarter the inflow and outflow rebalancing to a surplus, albeit assisted across by higher oil prices and the asset sales.</p>
          <p>Let me just recap on the asset sales, which are an important part of the continuous improvement program. They help improve our capital efficiency and more importantly refocus the portfolio on profitable growth assets.</p>
          <p>The sale proceeds for the quarter were $3.2 billion. Upstream, we concluded $2.4 billion of these. That covered 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in production with a prime transaction being the exit from the South Texas tight gas production.</p>
          <p>In the downstream, we concluded $800 million of non-core marketing positions divestment. Overall a very good start against the plan for this year to divest up to $5 billion of assets.</p>
          <p>In addition during the fourth quarter -- first quarter, we announced further potential asset sales which should complete later in 2011, 2012, and these included in the downstream selling Stanlow refinery in the UK and reducing our marketing exposure in Chile and in several African countries.</p>
          <p>We also began at the end of the quarter staff consultation to convert the Clyde refinery in Sydney, Australia to an import terminal. All this further proof on refocusing the downstream portfolio, for higher profitability and selective growth. And I guess, you all know, we are still working on $1 billion of cost reduction for 2011, 2012 that we have targeted from the downstream.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the growth. I mentioned, we started two new projects in the quarter, part of a sequence was over 20 new projects in the full-year 2011-- 2014 timeframe. In the Netherlands, we restarted production at the 20,000 barrel a day Schoonebeek heavy oil project. Schoonebeek is actually a rather old field, already produced 250 million barrels since 1947 when it first came on stream.</p>
          <p>With the field was shut in for economic reasons in 1996, but we looked at it again to find ways to extract more oil from it. With our value-added technology, the new steam flood scheme is expected to produce a further 120 million barrels over the next 25 years, and that's an enormous 50% uplift on recovery.</p>
          <p>In Qatar, I'm delighted to confirm, we had a very successful start-up so far at the 7.8 million ton per year Qatargas 4 LNG project.</p>
          <p>That train is now running at full capacity and has been from the beginning of April. It delivered, it's first LNG cargo only on the 19th of February to Hazira in India. So very quick ramp up. Later this year, Qatargas will start deliveries to Dubai and China in line with the long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>Staying in Qatar, and I am sure you all have an interest in this. We also achieved first gas from the offshore into the Pearl GTL project. This is an important milestone for Pearl out of the GTL Train 1 start up sometime in the middle of this year.</p>
          <p>We've actually now started to make syngas in the first bank of reactors at Pearl in the first train. This is our Shell proprietary technology. The next step is to take that syngas into the GTL reactors to make the wax. After that, we take the wax into or you may recall the refinery conversion units at the end of the train before we produce that first product sometime in the middle of this year.</p>
          <p>Worth also I think an update on Canada growth. In the oil sands, we are making good progress starting at the expansion project. The mine production is gradually increasing, and we are actually using some spare capacity in the original Scotford upgrader to process this bitumen. The construction of a new upgrader, the expansion, was completed in the first quarter. We're now in early commissioning stages and we should be fully operational by the end of the second quarter as planned. So overall, particularly on those big three projects, good progress bringing them on stream on track growing the company towards 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead a little bit longer beyond 2012, we've also made progress crystallizing some of the longer-term options. Just to remind you we are planning to take final investment decisions on some 10 new projects in 2011, 2012, these include Prelude Floating LNG in Australia, debottlenecking the Athabasca Oil Sands Project and deep water oil and gas developments at the Cardamom discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we've just included our share in recent gas discoveries in the Carnarvon basin. We included that into the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project. So now in that project, we have an 8% stake in the unitized gas fields for upstream production and a 6.4% stake in the liquefaction facilities to produce LNG. Wheatstone is being designed, the two train 8.9 million tonnes per year LNG project.</p>
          <p>On the exploration side, we also confirmed during the quarter the significant Geronggong discovery in deepwater Brunei. It was actually drilled last year, announced in the quarter, resource potential of some 200 million barrels.</p>
          <p>So just to summarize, excluding identified items, the CC earnings this year increased by some 29% year-on-year. Our performance in the quarter, we believe underlines that we are delivering on our strategy. We're making good progress on our three strategic themes that the shorter-term performance focus, the medium-term growth delivery to 2012 and creating the new growth options out into the rest of the decade.</p>
          <p>Our priorities remain a sharper delivery of strategy aiming for profitable growth and a more competitive overall performance.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's move to take your questions. And please could you try and restrict yourself just one or two each, so that we have the opportunity for everybody to ask a question.</p>
          <p>Operator, please could I ask you to poll for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe just a question on Asian gas. And I'm just wondering with strong Asian gas demand and the Japanese events of the quarter, how you're thinking about demand in that region and is there any thoughts around Sakhalin II in terms of that being expanded. Is that something that could be done? Is it something you're thinking about and would you have sufficient gas in the region to think about the third train there? And the second question just on your European gas production in the quarter it was down quite significantly. You mentioned some reduced demand there. Could you just say if that was actual production declines or was that a pure demand phenomena? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clint. I've seen some of your research covering this subject, Asian gas. So thanks for the question. The Asian gas demand, short-term yes has been impacted by the Japanese situation. We're diverted I think around 11 cargoes either swapped or diverted into Japan to try and help with the power situation there. We're basically putting it in a normal contract price. It has an impact, but essentially, it's not making a big event on earnings.</p>
          <p>We think that could be taking up to a million tonnes a month for some time, which actually adds up to the more than Sakhalin production if it were to continue in that level for a year. Medium and longer term, we've always seen Asian gas demand as a the prime driver of that strategy. About a third of the demand, global gas demand growth in total comes from China and close to another third from Asia and/or Middle Eastern markets. So about two thirds overall and we didn't see any reduction if anything is potentially an increase.</p>
          <p>What we have certainly been able to do over the past three to six months is take all spare gas of course Qatar is producing earlier and faster than we had expected. So we have had spare gas, but it's -- the Qatar has been able to market that away from North America and into the higher-value markets in Asia and Europe.</p>
          <p>This -- the question about Sakhalin II, the expansion is obviously, technically and operationally possible. We have in November signed a MoU, Peter was with the Gazprom in November where we agreed to look at the opportunities to expand their activities in Russia and potentially to -- with the flipside being co-operation in projects outside of Russia with Gazprom.</p>
          <p>We continue to look at that opportunity with Gazprom, it would almost certainly require us accessing more gas in the Sakhalin III area, which is under Gazprom control, but we have no real progress to report on that. So yes, we'd be interested. No we don't have concrete milestones on that. Our main growth in gas production to supply the Asian markets will come from Australia, the multiple projects that we have there.</p>
          <p>On the European gas production, I mentioned 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reduction, that's about 300 million scuffs. That's nearly all in Europe and primarily driven by the weather. It was colder last year, very cold last year in Europe. It was actually unseasonably warm this year, so quite a big difference. And many thanks for the questions Oswald, hopefully that's okay.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Jon Rigby, UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you highlighted the refining returning to profit. And it's not obvious from the data series on your refining margins, why this quarter will be profitable and some of the historic ones wouldn't have been on the basis of macro. So can you just talk a little bit more about the moving parts that got  you above the breakeven point this quarter and how much of that sustaining and how much is maybe temporary? I guess disposals may have an effect, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Potentially, it's a good question, Jon. It's actually the first profit I think since the last quarter of 2008 in refining. But it's so small, it's not material. So nearly all the <mark type="ph" /> oil products earnings (23:05) came from marketing and trading sector.</p>
          <p>And you're also right, it's difficult to correlate the industry margins with our own performance. Two reasons drive that, one is availability, where the availability of the units was quite a bit higher than it was last year as was the utilization of the units. We also in the North American market; the actual coking margins we were able to deliver were relatively attractive.</p>
          <p>So basically it's good North American refining and the fact that our availability was much higher. I would just highlight though we've given traditionally the refining splits and marketing and trading together. We are divesting refining capability to the extent that our marketing sales of over 4 million barrels are becoming increasingly greater than the refining throughput at 3 million and decreasing. And our actual trading activities book how we join molecule together. So as we go forward it's really the integrated value chain that drives us more so than a separate view of refining. And I think that's something we may need to consider as we go forward. It's becoming a bit of an odd split given the business model that's evolving as we decline our refining base.</p>
          <p>So, hopefully that helps.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Alastair Syme from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. My question also relates to refining. I guess I'm having the same difficulty. If you look at the &#x2013; you disclose, the cash flow in the quarter of about $4 billion. And if I'm right, I think you're talking about 2012 targets of about $12 billion overall across the downstream piece. Do we interpret that we are well above the mid cycle or performance is well on track on the 2012 target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another challenging question. Thank you, Alastair. The oil products, cash from operations does benefit by definition, it includes the <mark type="ph" /> coser (25:23) adjustment. So there's maybe $2 billion in there for the quarter that essentially is a one-off impact that goes up and down. So the underlying delivery is somewhat less. No we are not there, yet.</p>
          <p>And technically, we've not given a specific split of the downstream contribution to the cash flow target for 2012. Yes, we clearly need to uplift from previous year delivery, but we've not given a specific split, and we won't do so either. We retain the right to deliver. Are we above or below mid cycle? I think we're heading back towards mid cycle. I don't think we're there yet. Hopefully that covers it?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, Simon.  Perhaps a bit of follow-through in terms of the downstream comment. You did actually talk about improving <mark type="ph" /> loop (26:21) in the quarter, but also improving trading. Could you quantify what it does in terms of the trading contribution relative to 4Q? And then the second question was perhaps some slightly bigger picture question. Obviously some companies are thinking about the opportunities to look at liquefaction within the US. Do you think that's something you might look at over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lucy. We don't split out the trading results. Partly for the reason I just stated. Our trading activity is not a separate desk. It is the way we optimize value through the integrated hydrocarbon value chain. So there is an uplift in trading. It was a more volatile quarter. But it's only possible because of refineries and stock positions and marketing around which we can trade. So, overall marketing was back above $1.1 billion, marketing and trading together. I think back in the fourth quarter, it was more like $400 million or so. So it's quite a significant uplift overall. And that reflects both -- a pretty strong marketing performance too.</p>
          <p>Liquefaction in the U.S. I think we said around the strategy presentation time. Yes it's something that we could be interested in. Are we actively pursuing a project at the moment, no. It's a question of getting the capital cost down to a level at which it makes sense relative to the alternative means of monetizing gas. And there are -- oh -- sorry I'm thinking a little bit about gas to liquids, but in principle, LNG and GTL and gas to transport, or even gas to chemical, they are all different ways of monetizing gas against liquids prices.</p>
          <p>Yes, we are interested in LNG and looking actively, but it would more likely be in Canada than the United States. We're still not convinced that the U.S. has thought through the potential and the security issues around export of gas from the lower 48.</p>
          <p>So we think Canada is a more likely scheme there.</p>
          <p>On GTL, gas to chemical, gas to transport, these are all more ideas for the medium to longer-term if in fact gas to oil arbitrage opportunity remains as strong as it is today.</p>

          <p>I think you've quantified in the past that GTL probably is a goer if you don't see gas prices much above 6, but starts not to hang together above 8, do you have -- can you give some order of magnitude in terms of liquefaction?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of GTL, I think we said that the current gas to oil differential will probably make it attractive. We're not sure that this trend will sustain for a period long enough and sustainably enough to make that kind of investment. What we need to do is continue the work on the catalyst development and on getting the capital cost down. We will learn a lot from our own project in Pearl, in Qatar that will help us on the potential future efficiencies that will help us to answer that question better. But clearly, there is potential in the much longer-term and it would require significant investment to help convert some of the gas exposure to liquids.</p>

          <p>Hi, Irene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on the cash flow, I note you highlighted the delivery of $4 billion to $6 billion of cash including the disposals in the past sort of four quarters. So if I'm not mistaken, your target is $43 billion cash from operations excluding disposals, in which case, on my numbers you delivered about $36 billion on a rolling four quarter average on an $87 oil price. So there's still a gap of $6 billion to $7 billion to the target.</p>
          <p>And my question really is trying to think about the timing of a possible dividend increase. Should we be thinking, should we anticipate that you would look at that once you hit the targets or given the external pricing environment, which is substantially higher. Could that come earlier than next year?</p>
          <p>And then my second question on upstream performance, clearly it was weak versus expectations but also versus your own price sensitivities. Is the gap mostly the start-up costs in which case what should we anticipate for the rest of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Irene. Good question around the CFFO. Your first point, your arithmetic is absolutely correct. $36 billion, rolling 12 months, $87 a barrel, still something of a gap -- $6 billion, $7 billion. You may recall that we've always said Qatar was about a third of the uplift or around $4 billion at $70 oil price. So neither of the Qatar project is yet actually contributing anything material in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>At what point do we reconsider the dividend? Well, firstly it's a board consideration on a quarterly basis. We changed the dividend policy last year to imply that essentially, it's the structured cash flow delivery, the dividend will grow in line with cash flow and earnings. We're not quite there yet. We will also need to take a look at the balance sheet. The balance sheet is of course quite a lot stronger than not only it was a year ago, but probably a bit stronger than we'd actually expected it to be.</p>
          <p>And so I expect the discussion to become more live as we go through the year. But we're not there yet in terms of structural cash flow growth. It's not technically going to be driven by the macro but the balance sheet has effectively been put in much stronger place by the macro.</p>
          <p>Question on upstream performance in the quarter. There are a few factors impacting, but firstly, the start-up <mark type="ph" /> in the fees ex costs (33:00) around $400 million a quarter. It was less than half that level in the previous quarter and in Q4 particularly high level of spend in Qatar and in Canada.</p>
          <p>In Q2, it's going to remain at a reasonably high level as well. Thereafter it should start to fall off, we will be up and running in Canada and Qatargas 4 will be up and running. Hopefully, a little bit of performance in GTL as well. So it will that one will start to come back.</p>
          <p>A couple of other factors probably worth noting for Q1 performance. I mentioned the downtime from the maintenance is around 90,000 barrels a day. And also the divestments and together they effectively, relative to last year, cost us another $400 million. Then, of course, is the 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day of Gulf of Mexico production, that we would otherwise have had had it not been for the moratorium. And that's not a straight reduction, but we would have been drilling and in fact had expected to grow production in the Gulf of Mexico. And so that 25 plus thousand barrels a day has quite a significant impact as well. So if you put those cumulatively together, I think that explains what you might regard as a slightly weak upstream earnings. We feel they were reasonably strong at 4.6, underlying production was pretty good and the fact as I just described, none of them were a surprise to us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Simon. Actually just following up on that question, <mark type="ph" /> E&amp;P (34:46). Could you just talk about perhaps the delta on OpEx and increased royalties you are experiencing with the higher oil prices? And then just going forward through the year, I mean as you've had quite a lot of high margin barrels off for maintenance. I guess in particular with Nigeria, Bonga, do you expect that to come back on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Start with the second one, yes. Bonga it's high margin. Yes, it was under planned maintenance and I think it's ramping back up again now. So it will come back again.</p>
          <p>The changes in OpEx, there is a lot of talk about cost inflation coming back into the industry. We don't actually see that yet and when we go to market, maybe it will come. If it comes it will likely have more impact on CapEx than OpEx. So, our OpEx increases we will see increased OpEx as we go through the year as we start to incur, OpEx in for example oil sands and Qatar. The unit OpEx -- once all of those projects are online, we expect to go down a bit, because actually and particularly in Qatar, OpEx is relatively low.</p>
          <p>Royalties, tax, other increases always difficult to predict. I gave overly clear figures on the UK impact. Other royalty effects and tax effects is about on top of the UK effect, is just over $100 million year-on-year. It does vary from quarter-to-quarter. So not -- I can't project a particular impact there and we're just trying to manage our way through it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made earlier about your LNG portfolio. Having three projects in Australia that essentially would fulfill future market demand. Have do you go about prioritizing the marketing of those three projects? And would any of them be more appropriate say for just taking into your own portfolio versus a long-term contract with a single buyer or a group of buyers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. Good question. The three projects you talk about are Gorgon which is already under construction. Prelude, which hopefully is close to a final investment decision, that's the floating LNG project. And the third one is the CBM to LNG project coal bed methane or coal seam gas, which is in the Arrow project, which is a 50-50 joint venture with PetroChina and Shell's share of production in all three projects is between 3 and 4 million tonnes. And so we have about 10 million tonnes in total of Australian LNG to market.</p>
          <p>All of those volumes are effectively to be sold from the project to Shell and Shell will then market to customers. So in practice we are and have some contracts we are seeking in more that are not source or destination specific, where we sell to the customer and they are indifferent to the source of the LNG. So we are effectively taking them into Shell's portfolio and that's why the Australian projects make such a big difference to our overall portfolio. Because by and large the majority of our existing production is <mark type="ph" /> term lined (38:27) in from one source to one destination customer. Does that cover the answer because that actually determines how we prioritize?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

The first is to ask if you've got anything that you can say about the Campos Basin exploration find that Petrobras announced this morning, and maybe remind us what is next offshore Brazil? The second, staying with Brazil, with the rise in JV, I wonder if you can comment on the Brazilian press article in Valor that suggested the chairman Rubens Ometto has negotiated 25 million per annum pay package with Shell directly for 10 years there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. I can't comment on the Petrobras announcement, because I haven't actually read it. Our actual activity coming up this year is you may recall the BMS-54 block that last year, the <mark type="ph" /> Gato de Mayo (40:16) discovery is 80% Shell. We expect to drill at least a second well this year on that block on what is in effect an independent prospect within the block. We will need a second appraisal well on both of those prospects before we really know what we have in that particular area.</p>
          <p>The BC-10 Phase II project is progressing. We will be doing more drilling there. And we have a couple of other wells being drilled on our behalf by Petrobras that we have. It's a exciting time offshore for us in Brazil this year. Raizan JV reports on Rubens' pay package. This is Rubens' compensation not his remuneration. It's an effectively from the joint venture. He was a major shareholder or is a major shareholder of Cosan a big obviously supporter of the deal, not a Shell employee. No decision yet. Either it's not necessarily -- it's not really a decision for Shell. This is a decision for the joint venture. That's all I can say really.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Simon. Nice quarter. A couple of kind of big picture questions. I was wondering first with respect to service costs. What are your expectations over the next year? I think in particular one of the large three oil service providers is focused keenly on improving their margins significantly. And just wondering how you see your costs escalating over the next year? And then in the long run, what are your expectations with natural gas kind of on a global basis? Do you see prices -- more of a global price, or do you see kind of pockets where there will be dislocations based on supply and demand in that specific geographic region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, <mark type="ph" /> Jack (42:32). I will try and cover it briefly, because they're both quite complex subjects. Service costs generally that as I mentioned there is quite a lot of talk about potential inflation. But we don't actually see much yet when we go to market. I imagine many of the companies are focused on improving their margins. We may recall, couple of years ago, post the credit crunch a lot of companies said, a lot about going back to their suppliers and demanding reductions immediately, kicking the door down to do so in some cases. I think you may recall that we didn't do that we went back and opened up what we hope is more constructive discussion that said, how do we work together with some of our suppliers, including what I imagine are the big three. And how do we constructively manage for the benefit of both of us, the way through volatility in the price cycle, which is not actually of much help to either of us. We did come out of that with some what I think is much better improved contracting strategy and supplier relationships and agreements that provide both some long-term security of supply for the supplier and for us less volatility in the cost of the services.</p>
          <p>They will not provide 100% protection against another doubling or trebling of overall cost, but they will help us to ensure that we have access to the services and hopefully getting the A team from the service company, which is usually the biggest driver of value for us. A good relationship can have a lot of value. So we're not seeing that significant a change at the moment. And we think that the agreements have in place with most of our main suppliers will be robust against inflation.</p>
          <p>Gas prices longer run, clearly we're gas becoming a company, probably will produce more gas than oil this year. So a very important question for us. Three different markets North America will remain diverse from oil, pricing it will be driven by supply demand and alternative uses, also basically we believe at the top end alternative sources of fuel for power. We plan on the basis of a range of gas prices $4 to $8 per million cubic feet Henry Hub. And will the <mark type="ph" /> global (44:54) gas market develop well not to the core, that's not our expectation, at the margin there will be movement to molecules from and may be both directions from North America to Asia. But the Asian market, we see medium and long-term remaining quite closely linked to oil prices.</p>
          <p>And in between Europe that market has shifted already from what used to be 60% oil liquid related contracts and now is more like 40%, with the rest being sort or hub priced. That trend may continue, there is still a market for longer-term oil price linkage depending on the customers' wishes. But of course spot and hub price in the past quarter alone were 1.3 times higher than the Henry Hub price. So the fact that spot and hub prices may become the norm, does not necessarily mean they will be a lot lower. It's just a question of what kind of volatility and what kind of price arrangement does the customer want. So we see three markets. LNG will arbitrage between them, but probably more at the margins than it will do structurally. It's a complex situation. My pleasure.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I'll tell you there is not Iraq, but in essence it's basically higher LNG realizations. We've got every other area that you can think of it being a sway from Africa through Middle East through to Russia. So yes it does include Russia. But it will include the LNG from the Middle East, also from Nigeria. So that's really what's driving it.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And the second question is you talked about Cardamom, I understand that -- as of about 10 days ago 10 permits have been issued for the Gulf of Mexico, undoubtedly you are among those. Do you have any sort of prediction as what sort of number of permits you will hold by the end of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's a good opportunity to -- just reiterate to where we are in the Gulf. We have eight applications in including new exploration plans. We've had two of those exploration plans now approved, one approved and one accepted as complete. The approved one is Cardamom and the Appomattox plan has been accepted as complete is now in the consideration period. They are the only once so far to have reached that complete stage. So that's for new wells. The Cardamom first drilling permit was issued. We started drilling three weeks ago.</p>
          <p>So we are actually drilling exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico at the Cardamom prospect which is good news. Separately, we've also had approval &#x2013; one of the Perdido development wells which we're also about to drill. We've got five floating -- drilling units and we are drilling off some platforms work such as workovers and recompletions. Of the floaters that we've got, three of them are already new regulation ready and one is close.</p>
          <p>And the other one we've <mark type="ph" /> sent (48:53) down to Brazil for a while. So we're getting back to work, but it is still slow progress. We said we had expected to lose effectively 50,000 barrels a day production this year in the Gulf relative to what we otherwise would have achieved if there had been no moratorium. The rate at which we are coming back, we stick with the 50,000 we don't change that. But we would like to see the rest of our applications progressing through as well. But it's good to see that there is forward progress and that we are able to start drilling again.</p>

          <p>Two quick questions. The provision you made for UK tax seems pretty small in relation to your size. And certainly a lot smaller than your UK competitor announced yesterday. Is there some sort of tax relief there or kind of different treatment do you think which you're applying there. And secondly on Qatar, I just wondered if you could remind me of what percentage of the LNG volumes are long-term contract linked to oil from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start on the second question. We have not actually given the figures, it just indicates in the past that originally half the volume was targeted at North America and half at Europe. Qatargas does the marketing, they're doing an excellent job in redirecting not just short term, but long-term as well that gas into Asian markets and the Middle East itself. So we are in effect seeing quite an uplift compared to what we would otherwise have got had we been exporting into North America. The exact proportion is evolving as these contracts are being put into place and by the Qataris. We are very pleased with what they have been to able achieve so far.</p>
          <p>Uk tax provision, it's interesting one. We had to work a bit on this. We haven't taken a provision yet. The provision that we take, the big change will be next year in the first quarter. The reason we haven't taken the provision is basically the impact is a deferred tax liability that we carry as a result of capital allowances being different to depreciation. And the deferred tax asset that we carry, that reflects the future decommissioning liability. If those two are of a similar size, which in our case they are, the change in tax have no or little or no net impact, which is the case for us.</p>
          <p>They are very similar in size and no material net impact on the first quarter. If in fact that liability and asset are of a different size. Yes, you would get to one off impact up or down in any given quarter. So I can't speak for others but that's what our situation is. There of course is then an uplift every quarter, the current tax. The next year's provision in Q1 happens when effectively we've increased the deferred tax asset on the retirement obligation from the 50% to 62%. When the legislation is enacted, which is likely in Q1 next year, we will have to reduce that from 62% to 50%. And that impact is likely to be around $500 million. Bit complex and technical but hopefully that helps.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Simon. Afternoon. Hope you're well.  Could have a laugh and ask you to repeat those last comments, but I think we'll move on. Just a couple of questions if I might. Firstly, can you talk a little bit around CapEx phasing and the CapEx this quarter including associates looks very modest relative to the guidance. And secondly I wonder if you could talk a little bit more around the chemicals operations where, if I look at cracker margins, they are very high and the profits are heading have come back modestly. And in particular, what's happening with Bukom and why Bukom down for such an extended period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lucas. CapEx phasing, yes, it was effectively quite low. We gave an indication and we retain the same indication that we would likely spend this year, $28 billion on organic investments and $2 billion on acquisitions. And the two was the completion of the Raizen in Brazil. So the going rate would be $7.25 billion. The actual rate in Q1 was in $4 billion.</p>
          <p>Clearly one is just typical phasing, particularly in the downstream tends to be back-ended. And you can see that in the downstream CapEx figures.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the upstream, we are seeing the CapEx coming off on some big projects. And while we expect to take some new FIDs ids, they not all taken yet. So I would expect in the bigger FIDs that will have had some which I mentioned earlier. They will see an uptick in the upstream spend as we go late through the year.</p>
          <p>On the chemicals margins, yes, Asia was the main challenge for us where potentially we could have done better. The issues at Bukom are just basically related to the start-up of the plant and still working to optimize the performance there. So no real comment on the underlying issues, hope to be back up and running in the not-too-distant future.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Simon, is $28 billion of CapEx a realistic number for you now?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, this year. Yeah, and if you could tie that immediate thoughts on US GAAP expenditure as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll reserve judgment on whether it's realistic. We will have to try quite hard I guess to spend on that rates in organic. Particularly the other point that you arise on US GAAP. We have stated in the past, we've got the portfolio expense somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion per year on this activity. Typically our investments, the strategic plan looks at something in the middle of that range. It's likely or certainly as early planning is more at the bottom end of that range, while the gas price stays at $4. But there's still some quite potential on the liquids, the more liquids rich part of the portfolio. And just on the FID, things like Prelude, Cardamom, the two UK projects <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:41) and the Athabasca debottlenecking. They will start to take up the slack fairly quickly as we get into the second part of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon. Good afternoon. I had a couple of things. I think one of the slides indicates that in the first quarter you acquired some additional Rockies and Marcellus acreage. Wondered if you could quantify that both in terms of acreage and cost? We will also appreciate some commentary on what the Americas unconventional gas production looked like in the quarter and how it compared to prior periods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. We picked up a little bit more acreage in the Marcellus and around the North American plays. But it's not been that material in terms of what we were picking up relatively underdeveloped shall we say, we are not paying top dollars. And the unconventional gas production, during last year, we grew to 1.2 Bcf a day by the end of the year. Of course we are now seeing the impact of the investment in South Texas. So we were back just above a Bcf a day or 180,000 barrels a day oil equivalent. So it's a dropped back again, but we expect that figure to grow as we go through the year, particularly at the Haynesville, <mark type="ph" /> Grand Birch (57:19) latterly out of Marcellus.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; [05LCGY-E Mark Gilman]: Okay. Simon if I could. I was confused by your comments during your direct remarks on the UK tax impact and why the 2012, $100 million per quarter number ostensibly at the same price level was so much higher than what you envisioned for the balance of this year given the March 24th effective date of the increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's partly a pick up in the expected profitability in the UK, just a factor of variety of issues, production prices et cetera. But that is how it is. It's an average of $100 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Simon. Just one quick question on the Gulf of Mexico. You mentioned that situation on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:24) and the 50,000 target still unchanged. But in terms of cost, what we can see in terms of the -- you coming back and drilling again there, is it going to be any kind of reaction on cost there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the questions. Good point, worth noting. And we did -- actually we did take another $60 million in the first quarter on cost. As we go forward, the cost impact is primarily in capital not OpEx. The new regulations as we see them and interpret them, we don't expect to add material cost as by and large they reflect the practices both in design and operations that we were already applying.</p>
          <p>The unknown factors that quite a lot of the reports that come out to date contain recommendations. They don't actually change the legislation yet. So it's possible regulation still have some room to develop. We're also &#x2013; I'm not entire sue how some of the regulations will be interpreted. It is possible that some of them will make it take longer to do drill a well. And we'll still be paying the same spread rate and it could be $1 million a day on a rig plus the support activities. So that we don't know, yet, because we need to get a bit more experience. But by and large, as the regulations are drafted, they reflect practice and for example, in Europe and the standards that we were already applying.</p>

          <p>We have one final question from Sergio Molisani from UniCredit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Last question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. Two questions if I may. The first one on the Pearl GTL, on the occasion on the Qatar trip you gave a sort of guidelines for the operating cash flows expected from Qatar based on a price scenario of $50 to $70 per barrel and if I remember well the guidance was $3 billion to $4 billion more or less until 2020. Can you give us an idea of what would be this cash flow on an $100 per barrel oil price scenario. And the second question is on CapEx. Your US$28 billion guideline, includes or is gross or net of the circa $1 billion of start up costs that you guided for. Considering if I understand well, these are start-up cost or investments that you are not allowed to capitalize pending the start up of this project? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'll take the last question first. $1 billion is OpEx is not part of the CapEx. So it's the $28 billion is separate and is genuine investment activity. On Pearl GTL, you are absolutely right in your memory. $3 billion to $4 billion or $50 to $70. All we had is $70 is $4 billion of cash flow per year and that's both projects, not just GTL but Qatargas 4 as well. We've not given any update at higher oil prices, mainly because we don't necessarily expect to stay $120 for long enough for it to be a sensible discussion. So I can't really to be honest give you an additional factor. But hopefully it's good that we can confirm the $4 billion at $70.</p>
