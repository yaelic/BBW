        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brock.  Good afternoon everyone. We are pleased that you could</p>
          <p>join us today to discuss our 2007 annual and fourth quarter results we released yesterday. With me in the room are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Don Ingram, Senior Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products, and Mike D'Aguiar, Vice President of Finance.</p>
          <p>In today's call, John will discuss the financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights. Don Ingram will give an update on the Midstream and Refined Products divisions. John will then conclude and we will open the call up for questions, starting with analysts followed by the media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors. These factors are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and on our website.</p>
          <p>In addition, reference is made in today's comments to Husky's reserves and resources. Our quarterly release and our annual filings also contain cautionary notes in respect of reserves and resources.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tanis, and good afternoon to everyone.  I'm pleased to report that in the year 2007, Husky continued to demonstrate record financial and operating performance.  In today's conference call, I would like to highlight Husky's many successes during the year and how these position us for the future.</p>
          <p>Financially, Husky achieved records in revenue, cash flow and net earnings.  Sales and operating revenue were 15.5 billion in 2007, compared with 12.7 billion in 2006.  Cash flow from operations in 2007 increased 21% to 5.4 billion or $6.39 per share.  Earnings were 3.2 billion or $3.79 per share in 2007, up 18% from 2.7 billion or $3.21 per share in 2006.</p>
          <p>Operationally, Husky achieved 5% growth in production to 377,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Crude oil and NGL production was 273,000 barrels of oil per day, an increase of 10% over 2006.  Natural gas production averaged 623 million cubic feet per day reflecting Husky's decision to redeploy capital in Western Canada due to weakening gas market conditions and a higher cost environment.</p>
          <p>During the year, Husky accomplished notable success and made significant progress on a number of major projects.  Our operations offshore the East Coast of Canada provide a strong contribution to Husky's financial performance.  At the White Rose oil field, production averaged 117,000 barrels per day.  85,000 barrels per day net to Husky.  We expect that production for 2008 will be within our guidance range following the recently completed turnaround.</p>
          <p>In December, Husky announced the signing of an agreement with the Newfoundland and Labrador government formalizing the terms for development of the White Rose satellite fields.  Under the agreement, the royalty terms for the original White Rose oil field remain unchanged and are contractually guaranteed for the remainder of the field life.</p>
          <p>At the North Amethyst field, the first of the White Rose satellite developments, front end engineering and a glory hole were completed in 2007.  Production from this field is expected in late 2009 or early 2010.  Husky has reached a three-year agreement with Transocean for the Glomar Grand Banks, a mobile semi-submersible drilling unit for the development drilling of the satellite fields.</p>
          <p>Offshore Greenland, Husky acquired interests in three exploration blocks.  Husky holds a 87.5% interest each in Blocks 5 and 7 and a 43.75% interest in Block 6.  Completion of a high-resolution aero-gravity and magnetic survey and a 10,000 kilometer 2D seismic's program are planned for 2008 to evaluate prospects of these blocks.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, Husky completed the gas sale and purchase agreements for the sale of natural gas from the Madura BD Field.  The term of each agreement is for 20 years commencing with first production, which is expected in 2011.  Husky has submitted the plan of development to the Government of Indonesia for this field and is in the process of negotiating an extension to the production sharing contract.</p>
          <p>In South China Sea, Husky completed a large 3D seismic program over Block 29/26, which contains the Liwan discovery.  Delineation and further exploration on the block will begin in the second half of 2008 with the arrival of the West Hercules deepwater drilling rig.  Also, during 2008, a 3D seismic's program will be conducted over portions of 29/06 which is located adjacent to 29/26.</p>
          <p>In December 2007, Husky agreed to purchase 110,000 acres of oil sands leases at McMullen located in the west central portion of the oil sands region for 105 million.  These leases are located adjacent to the Weaver oil sands leases currently held by Husky.</p>
          <p>In Midstream, Husky completed the expansion of the Lloydminster Upgrader to 82,000 barrels per day.  Upon reviewing alternative options following the Lima refinery and evaluating the front end engineering cost estimates, we have decided to defer further expansion of this facility.  But, it remains an option for the future.</p>
          <p>In the Refined Products, Husky completed the construction and commenced production of its 130 million liters per year ethanol plant at Minnedosa.  With the completion of the Lloydminster and Manitoba ethanol plants, Husky is the largest producer and marketer of ethanol in Western Canada.</p>
          <p>In 2007, Husky acquired the Lima refinery in Ohio, USA.  The purchase of this refinery provides Husky with downstream options for bitumen and heavy oil development, as well as marked our re-entry into the United States.  We are very pleased with quality of asset and the dedication and commitment of Lima employees enabling the integration of its facility into Husky's operation and business systems in February 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2008, Husky will focus on the Lima refinery's front-end engineering work to convert the facility to process a heavier feedstock.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, Husky announced an agreement with BP to create an integrated oil sands joint venture business.  Under the agreement, Husky will contribute its main Sunrise lease while BP will contribute its Toledo refinery.  The final agreements and regulatory approvals are progressing and the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter with an effective date of January 1st, 2008.</p>
          <p>Husky will receive immediate revenue and cash flow from the Toledo facility.  With respect to the Sunrise project, the joint venture partners will provide expertise and management to proceed with the development while minimizing the risks associated with a mega project by securing a downstream solution for our production.</p>
          <p>Husky's balance sheet remains strong.  Including the acquisition of the Lima refinery and a 2007 capital program of 2.9 billion, our debt to cash flow ratio was only 0.5 to 1 at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased to report that our total proved plus probable reserves at December 31st, 2007 increased by more than 30% to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared with 2.4 billion barrels at the end of December 2006.  This reserve base provides a strong foundation for Husky's future production growth.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Don Ingram to give an update on the Midstream and Refined Products divisions</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.  Our Midstream &amp; Refined Products Division again achieved a number of records in 2007.  Upgrader earnings for the year were 282 million in 2007, similar to 2006, despite a 49-day plant turnaround in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure and marketing earnings for 2007 were 253 million, 28% higher than 2006 due to the higher pipeline and commodity marketing margins.  Our Canadian Refined Products division showed record earnings and throughput.  Net earnings were 192 million in 2007 compared to the 106 million in 2006 due primarily to strong product margins and the addition of our ethanol business at Lloydminster.</p>
          <p>Our light oil sales volumes per outlet increased again to 13,200 liters per day in 2007 compared to 12,900 liters per day in 2006.  Since acquiring the Lima refinery, we were pleased with Husky's US refining and marketing operations.  Earnings for the six months of operations were 105 million.</p>
          <p>Average throughput for the six months was 144,000 barrels per day, in line with our original projections.  For the full year of operations of the Lima refinery, the Minnedosa ethanol plants and the addition of the Toledo Refinery, we expect 2008 to be another strong year for the Midstream &amp; Refined Products area.</p>
          <p>I'll pass the call back to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Don.  Husky Energy has successfully achieved record performance in all areas of operations: upstream, midstream, and downstream.  All had a record year.  The year 2007 highlights Husky's strength in financial performance and operational success.  A number of significant achievements were made in all areas of our operations.</p>
          <p>Husky will continue to advance our exploration and developments in oil sands, Offshore Canada's East Coast and internationally.  The purchase of Lima refinery and the joint venture with BP allow Husky to receive immediate revenue and cash flow while minimizing the risk associated with volatile market environments in large scale projects.</p>
          <p>With our substantial reserve base, combined with a strong balance sheet and expected cash flow, Husky is well positioned to capitalize on expansion opportunities.  We expect year 2008 will be another successful year for Husky Energy.  Back to you Tanis.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question today comes from Terry Peters of Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I just -- two questions, the first was, you just commented on your year-over-year performance in some of your divisions, but those include 395 million in future tax benefits associated with lower tax rates.  Can you give a breakdown of how that tax benefit was allocated by your division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you talk about the year-to-year performance, about the included tax adjustments, if you look at the balance sheet # 9, we actually explained quite well.  This year we do receive about 395 tax benefit.  But, year 2006, we do have a 360 million as well.  So, if you normalize it, it will be more or less inline with our net bottom performance comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, they were essentially allocated the same in both years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one is second quarter in 2006 and then this year we received a government approval everything in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that, okay.  My second question relates to your reserve additions and could you outline the source of your oil reserve additions and your gas reserve additions, the major components to your probable reserve adds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our Sunrise Oil Sand project as far as reserve goes, 649 million probable reserves.  And then on the Madura, we have a sales and reserve 423 million barrels Bcf of gas sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>423 Bcf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>423.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and is the Sunrise, is that 100% or 50%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Sunrise at the moment we have said that contracts haven't been formalized.  As you see the completion of contract is first quarter effective date 1st January, so this is a 100% Sunrise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what portion of Sunrise does -- reserve bookings would that probable reserve represent, which -- how many phases or could you give me--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total is about 3.2 billion reserves of probable and half of that is above 1.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what you expect to book over time as you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, over the full project life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks very much, John.</p>
        </plist>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our next question today comes from Robert Plexman of CIBC World Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John.  I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John.  I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions related to your reserve replacement and FD cost performance.  It looks like a good year with reserve additions more than replaced production last year and if I just divide the CapEx of the upstream by the reserve adds, I get a little under $15 a barrel for an FD cost.  And, just wondering how you react to that number when you saw it, is it something that you take some satisfaction in or is it something that is better than expected or not as good as expected given the environment we're in oil prices are higher, but costs are escalating and it's getting more difficult to find resources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I actually &#x2013; I'm quite pleased with the figure because our internal calculations are run 18 to $17 in view of the high cost and price.  So, this figure come out to around $15 or something, it is a bit better than our internal expectation.  If you look on to look on the past, the major addition to Husky's further reserve will be the Madura.  We are working hard with the government to get the development plan, extension plan approved.  So, at the moment the Madura reserve will all be impossible, so that would be a major jump for this coming year to ship to even some improved and some improbable category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And, can I ask you the other question, and this relates to the Tucker Oil Sands project.  Just reading the interim report, I'm trying to understand how big a challenge or how big a problem you have at Tucker right now getting that SAGD running as you want it?  So could you put that in perspective for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you picked a tough question, but I can give you a easy answer.  And the Tucker is one of the project as far as we are concerned is always quite challenging when you start the project.  To answer your question based on the design facility, these new ones are the best and so far, we are well under the budget.  The cost per barrel is only about less than 16,000.</p>
          <p>The reserve side; we go through the reserve again, the reserve is really inline with our expectation, actually it's better this year.  We have a reserve increase approved by external evaluators to add on another 10 million barrels of addition proven reserve.  So, on the operation side, the production growth actually has been slower than what we expected.  I can actually highlight some of the challenges.</p>
          <p>Firstly, when we complete the projects, there are some of the drilling and also welding haven't been really up to our standard, in view of the high pressure and high heat, we like to reduce some of the wells.  And secondly, some of the well require stimulating, the well required bit more time.  Our production, we want to push the production program so that coming few years, we are going to re-look at the program, we want to have modest growth per year, why then push it for the sake of say 10,000 barrel.  This year we so far have been doing very well, we reduce some of the work, but I do admit, our production profile is a bit lower than our expectation.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.  I'm just wondering given your growing position in US refining, if you can comment on your view of the state of the US economy and how that might affect demand for petroleum products at your refineries and also margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeff I think this is a very, very important question.  If you look at the Husky position in Lima refinery, we are actually above 150,000 barrel per day now.  On completion of the Toledo refinery we have another 150,000, but take 50% of a &#x2013; the position for Husky now is completely quite strong in Ohio.  If you look at the downstream market in Ohio with the two production we are actually occupied about 50% to 60% of the downstream refined products.</p>
          <p>So it is very significant for us to position there.  But look at the political side, we have nothing major change, because the BP and Husky are both outside US corporation and for us is to acquire of the Lima refinery which used to be the owner-being locked in a US company.  So, we as a Canadian company are pretty well positioned to the re-entry of the Mac into the Ohio that is, in particular the US markets.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just your view of the refining margins then with the economy weakening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right.  I wish the refining margin will continue to be as strong as these couple of years.  But from our economics we are using quite a low figure.  So, we feel comfortable that both refinery will continue to contribute quite significantly to Husky on the downstream operations.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I just wanted to ask if with Sunrise, if you are looking at the issue of emissions reduction and making an investment along those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jon it is a very important question because we are looking at emission as well and all this will be taken care of when we finish the final engineering.  Every ton of reduction means a lot of money.  And in view of one company already work with government on the oil sands emission and also the royalty, we don't want to come in at this stage, we prefer to wait and see.  For us it's already taken into account.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>

          <p>Hi, Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.  It seems you have about 741 million on a bank facility, can you comment on any potential terms that are out in the public markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's say &#x2013; let's start with the $1.5 million bridge facility that was raised to finance the Lima acquisition last year, we termed 750 million of that outs in the bond market in September.  And as far as the balance is concerned, we are waiting to see how the credit markets unfold in 2008 with current high commodity prices, our free cash flow should be sufficient this year to repay the remainder of the bridge facility without recourse to the debt markets.  But if we see a favorable opportunity to access the long-term debt markets to strengthen the company's capital base, we may do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Louis, you know quite well, Husky is one of the -- I call it a very strong company.  Almost all the Husky assets, major refinery projects, we don't have a financial covenant on the borrowing; the same as every Esso the company don't have any debt on the zeros.  So our cash flow for the coming year will be quite significantly above this year as you see because of the two refining contribution.  And as Mike mentioned, we did a very good bond issue, we get a very favorable interest rate.  We see the market right time for the 750 million.  In particular, the term of 30 years will have it a portion.  So I think it is a well done on the financial side.</p>
