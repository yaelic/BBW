      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, operator, for that fulsome introduction and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.</p>
          <p>Before we review our financial results I'd like to do two things: Review our accomplishments in 2010 overall and for each business and provide a brief outlook. In 2010, Morgan Stanley participated in nearly every signature transaction to raise capital and helped reinvigorate the markets. Whether it was the GM and Citi IPOs in the U.S., ABC in China and Petrobras in Brazil among many others, Morgan Stanley was a skilled and trusted advisor to governments, corporations and investors, as we worked to restore economic growth and create new investment opportunities around the world.</p>
          <p>In institutional securities, we finished at or near the top of the league tables in M&amp;A, global equity and IPOs, A great testament to the teamwork between Investment Banking, Global Capital Markets and Equities. It's Morgan Stanley at our best. We also saw market share improvements in our equity sales and trading business.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we faced difficult markets in 2010. Our results reflect that more work needs to be done in some of our fixed income businesses. While our strategy in this business remains intact, we bolstered our efforts through the following organizational changes, including: Ken deRegt as Global Head of Fixed Income Sales and Trading based in the U.S. and as a result, Keishi Hotsuki will serve as interim Chief Risk Officer.</p>
          <p>To better align our business and geographic objectives, which will also &#x2013; which we will also do in reinforcing our efforts in Fixed Income, Colm Kelleher, in addition to running Sales and Trading will assume coverage of Europe, the Middle East and non-Japan Asia and will now be based in London, and Paul Kelleher, in addition to running Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking &#x2013; I'm sorry; Paul Taubman, will assume coverage of Latin America and Japan and will remain in New York.</p>
          <p>In Global Wealth Management [GWM] we've also made some additional organizational changes driven by Charlie Johnston's decision to retire at the end of this year. Charlie will continue through the end of the years as Vice-Chairman of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Greg Fleming will become President of GWM in addition to Asset Management. Jim Rosenthal was appointed Chief Operating Officer of the firm in January and continues in his role in the integration of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.</p>
          <p>Overall, these management changes reflect our desire for superior execution and our belief in what the future environment demands from our leadership, as well as obviously the departure of Tom Nides, our former Chief Operating Officer who has moved to serve in Washington.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Smith Barney integration, we're pleased with our progress. We remain on track as evidenced by the increased profitability this quarter and net new money for the full year. Revenues and margins will continue to improve as individual investors further engage.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management we refocused the business around our core institutional and merchant banking franchises, added talent and addressed the issues posed by a distressed global real estate market.</p>
          <p>Globally our colleagues in Japan worked hard to launch our strategic joint venture with Mitsubishi Bank, a partnership that is already starting to pay important dividends in terms of our ability to serve clients and with the sale of CICC's stake, we're poised to start a new chapter on the very strong relationships we've built in China and across Asia for many years. We're currently pursuing a domestic license in China and recently received approval to form a new investment banking joint venture with Huaxin Securities, also known as China Fortune Securities.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Australia, our people on the ground are capitalizing on the Morgan Stanley brand to take advantage of the many opportunities we now see.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've made progress executing our strategy despite challenging market conditions this year. We remain confident as evident by our success in investment bank and equities, our disciplined approach with Smith Barney and our subsequent &#x2013; substantial improvement in Asset Management. Looking forward, we continue to focus on growing revenue, earnings, and ROE in each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our priorities for 2011 and 2012 include: within institutional securities, obviously improving our results within fixed income sales and trading, and maintaining our leadership positions in investment banking and equity sales and trading. Within Global Wealth Management: growing our transaction and advisory business, increasing deposit and lending revenues and, after the completion of the integration in 2012, to see a commensurate cost reduction. Within Asset Management: monetizing our strong investment performance in the core business and optimizing our expenses.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to compensation. A year ago, we explicitly said you would not see the same compensation ratios of 2009 and we did not. The full year ratio was 51%, down from 62% a year ago, which was in part driven by extremely high DVA. In absolute terms, full year compensation was higher due to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney completion of 12 months and the investment in sales and trading. We also demonstrated discipline through our compensation structure. In fact our higher deferral rates and clawbacks balanced prudence with incentives which are important to shareholder considerations. This management team is intently focused on improving earnings and ROE and in the process we will reward our shareholders and our employees.</p>
          <p>Thank you, now I'll turn over to Ruth to review our financial results in more detail, and we'll both be available for question and answer.</p>

          <p>Thank you, James. For the quarter ended December 31, income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley was $867 million, with diluted earnings per share of $0.43 after preferred dividends. There were four factors that drove our results this quarter: first, ongoing strength in Investment banking and equity sales and trading, historically very strong areas for us; second, subdued results in fixed income, where we continued to work on our turnaround; third, notable progress in both Global Wealth Management and Asset Management; and finally, strategic asset sales and expense discipline.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter revenues of $7.8 billion included two noteworthy items: a $668 million or $0.17 per share gain from the sale of CICC and negative $945 million or $0.36 per share impact from the tightening of credit spreads on firm issued structured notes commonly referred to as DVA.</p>
          <p>This quarter, DVA was driven by a larger outstanding balance, a longer weighted average maturity, and further maturity extension in a portion of our notes.</p>
          <p>The full-year firm wide compensation ratio was 51%. Excluding negative DVA of $873 million and the U.K. bonus tax of $272 million, the ratio would have been 49%. Non-compensation expenses increased 12% sequentially including higher technology and legal costs. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up roughly 7% annually, normalizing for 12 months of Smith Barney. The increase was driven by higher business activity, as well as our ongoing investments in technology. Notably, book value at the end of the quarter was $31.49 per share, up 16% for the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $808 billion at December 31, down 34 billion sequentially, driven by lower client activity. Although our calculations are not yet final, we believe our Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel I will be 16% and our Tier 1 common ratio will be 10.5% demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet. Risk weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $328 billion at December 31.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our businesses: Institutional Securities revenues of $3.6 billion included the impact of CICC and DVA, as mentioned earlier. Non-interest expenses were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 20% from the third quarter on higher compensation and the seasonality of non-compensation expenses. For the full year, non-interest expenses increased slightly. The full year compensation ratio was 43%. Excluding negative DVA of $873 million and the U.K. bonus tax of $269 million the ratio would have been 40%. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $437 million.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking revenues were $1.5 billion, up 50% from last quarter. For 2010, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs, number 1 in global equity and number 2 in both global completed and global announced M&amp;A. For the year, we advised on eight of the top ten announced M&amp;A transactions. In the quarter, we were a book runner on all five of the top five transactions in global equity and four of the top five transactions in global IPOs.</p>
          <p>Advisory revenues of $484 million were up 30% sequentially driven by higher activity in EMEA and the Americas. Significant announced M&amp;A transactions in the quarter were the $21 billion combination of Weather Investments and VimpelCom in Europe and the $10 billion restructuring of Westfield Group in Australia. Equity underwriting revenues were $661 million, our highest reported quarter.</p>
          <p>We saw improvement across all regions. Asia, once again, was particularly strong, with notable offerings, including AIA's $21 billion IPO, Petronas Chemicals Group's $5 billion IPO and China Rongsheng Heavy Industries' $2 billion IPO.</p>
          <p>Fixed income underwriting revenues of $370 million were relatively flat to last quarterly as lower bond issuance was largely offset by higher loan syndication fees. Overall, our investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products and regions.</p>
          <p>Equity sales and trading revenues of $1.1 billion included negative DVA of 103 million. Cash equity revenues increased sequentially on higher client activity and increased market share. Derivatives revenues, similarly improved, given a more stable volatility environment and increased client flows. And prime brokerage revenues increased from the third quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our existing clients.</p>
          <p>Average client balances continue to grow, up 11% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Fixed Income Sales and Trading negative revenues of $29 million included negative DVA of $842 million. Interest rate, credit and currency revenues were down from last quarter across all business. Commodities revenues were relatively flat to the third quarter as lack of market volatility continued to dampen client activity. Our results also continued to reflect a drag from the tightening of monoline credit spreads.</p>
          <p>Turning to VaR, average trading VaR declined to $132 million from $142 million last quarter, primarily driven by reductions in interest rate and credit. Average non-trading VaR decreased to $95 million from $103 million, primarily due to the sale of our equity stake in Invesco.</p>
          <p>Global Wealth Management revenues of $3.4 billion increased 8% sequentially, as higher commissions, asset management fees, and net interest income more than offset lower trading revenues. Commissions increased 31% from last quarter, as higher client activity was driven by new issuance and secondary trading. Non-interest expenses were $3 billion, up 5% from last quarter, both on a higher non-compensation and compensation expenses. Integration costs were approximately $63 million.</p>
          <p>The compensation ratio of 59% in the fourth quarter continues to be driven primarily by the formulaic grid payout, however, the lower ratio this quarter reflects reductions in non-FA compensation, which is not likely sustainable in the near term.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax was $390 million and the PBT margin was 12%, up from 9% last quarter. Total client assets increased 4% sequentially, to $1.7 trillion on market appreciation and net asset inflows of $14.1 billion in the quarter. Net new money for the year was $22.9 billion.</p>
          <p>The number of FAs was 18,043, within our expected range of 17,500 to 18,500 while turnover within our top two quintiles remained in line with historical lows. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $113 billion of which $55 billion is held by Morgan Stanley banks.</p>
          <p>Asset Management net revenues of $858 million increased 7% from the third quarter. Core Asset Management revenues of $410 million included higher asset management fees and increased gains on seed investments as well as a $126 million impairment charge related to the restructuring of FrontPoint, and a $96 million gain on the sale of our equity stake in Invesco. Merchant banking revenues of $448 million included investment gains in real estate and private equity. Approximately $109 million was related to investment gains from consolidated MSRE [Morgan Stanley Real Estate] funds.</p>
          <p>Given the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of the gains are passed to third party investors in the non-controlling interest line. Approximately $95 million of the principal investment gains were from private equity, primarily driven by Asian investments.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses for Asset Management declined 4% from last quarter, on lower compensation and non-compensation expenses. PBT was $356 million for a margin of 41%. Total AUM increased slightly to $279 billion, primarily due to higher market levels. Asset flows were negative $600 million during the quarter, primarily driven by $1.5 billion of outflows related to FrontPoint.</p>
          <p>As of December 2010, over 70% of our long term strategies continue to outperform their respective benchmarks on a three, five and ten-year basis.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our outlook: we are increasingly encouraged by the pace of the recovery as reflected in capital markets activity. Key indicators include: strengthening equity markets, improving corporate confidence reflected in M&amp;A activity, successful equity issuances across industries globally, higher investor activity and ongoing growth in emerging markets. That said, the potential for more policy intervention that drove the risk on, risk off investor sentiment last year remains, due to both macroeconomic issues and ongoing regulatory implementation. Sovereign credit concerns in Europe continue to be at the forefront.</p>
          <p>And in the U.S., distressed state and local budgets as well as the deficit remain open items. Inflation risk in emerging markets could also elicit policy moves. And on regulation, added clarity regarding certain elements of Basel and Dodd-Frank are helpful, although final rules are clearly still in formation.</p>
          <p>While our overall performance is dependent on the global market environment we believe we are well positioned for the evolving regulatory regime with an emphasis on client focused businesses supported by appropriate capital and liquidity. Our growing client footprint and investments across the firm are key to leveraging the strengths we have across many of our businesses, and closing gaps in others.</p>
          <p>With disciplined investment and implementation preceding performance. Looking forward, we are focused on growing our share of the market by leveraging our global brand and client franchise to provide the highest service to clients and stronger returns to our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you and now we will take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question will come from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning James, good morning Ruth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James, you spoke to more work to be done in Fixed Income to drive revenue and market share growth. Other than the announced management changes, could you just give us maybe your top three action items to get there? I get a lot of questions from investors on what exactly is the limiting factor in closing that gap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I go ahead with that? As James said, as I said, we are in the first of a two-year steady build of that business and as we've talked about in the past, our view is that we were subscale and although we had a good mix of structured solutions and flow business, we really needed to build out the flow business more. And that's really the conversation we've been having about rates and foreign exchange. So we've, you know, built out that footprint, we're building flow but when you look at this quarter, you know, there is really a bit of a virtuous cycle with a broader, deeper footprint allowing more efficient trading to support our client activity and so really with the build-out of our footprint, we are leveraging the strength we have across Institutional Securities with clients to drive those relationships deeper, but it is the first year of a two year steady build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Ruth. Then switching gears over to Global Wealth Management, we certainly saw the impact of improving retail engagement on the top line results but could you just give us an update on the timeline of the platform integration and when should we expect these cost synergies to be realized and continue to help margins drive higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We were pleased to see continued retail investor engagement in the fourth quarter and that is reflected in higher transactional revenues. The integration process is moving very much on track. As you look at, you know, what does that mean and how do we look at the overall PBT targets? We're still very much focused on PBT of 20%, that's market dependent and so just a couple of pieces as you look through 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>First of all retail activity was important. It helped drive the transaction revenues. I would caution you, there are fewer trading days in the first quarter of '11, that is relevant, but as we look forward, the market remains constructive. The building blocks to get to that 20% PBT margin are, to your point, completion of the integration and the drag that comes from the spend, but it's also a function of building up our lending business as we've talked about before, because with the lending business we have the benefit of driving the non-compensable revenues which are an important part to reducing our overall compensation ratio in the business.</p>
          <p>The third element of the PBT margin expansion is market dependent. We've said that, but just to give you a couple of data points that might be helpful. Every 100 point change in the S&amp;P we estimate impacts margin around 1%, all else being equal and that's not looking at investor psyche and reaction but it's really more on the asset management fee side. Similarly, every 50 basis point change in Fed Funds can impact margin around 1% as well. It's really those elements: completing the integration, building up the lending business and market dependent that drives us to the 20% margin over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Those sensitivities are really helpful. I guess maybe asked another way and I don't know whether you look at it this way but if there's no change in revenues from, let's say, where we are to the end of the year in the fourth quarter, what would you anticipate your margins to be as we exit 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to do a forecast roll-forward. We were hoping to give you the pieces so that you can model it out yourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just say this, Howard: we're not passive in managing the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, understood and I'll put pencil to paper. Finally for me, Ruth, you spoke about the impact of the monoline exposure on Fixed Income results. Could you give us a little more detail on what exactly is driving that? Is that the health of the wraps or your hedging against that or the counterparty exposure? What should we be watching going forward to just continue to see that and how it impacts FICC? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is a legacy exposure. It's going to take time to work out. Main point that we've talked about repeatedly is we're not taking on new outside risks. We were a counterparty in a trade and we hedged our exposure. There was detail in the Q and you know there will of course be updated data in the K. But this quarter the hedges went the other way on tightening monoline credit exposures which is what resulted in the losses. So it was costly to hedge this quarter. You may continue to see a drag depending on market direction. The loss this quarter was 263 million, you know, pretty much in line with last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, many thanks for all the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question will come from Glen Schorr with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Quick one. So equity was up in the quarter. Assets came down a little bit on the balance sheet but the Tier 1 Common Ratio was down a little bit. I'm just curious if something changed on the risk weightings or how that works? I know it was small but just interesting directionally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First, at this point our risk weighted asset number is just an estimate. The final numbers will be in the K but risk weighted assets increased from 325 billion at the end of the third quarter to, we estimate, 328 billion at December 31. So to your point, it was a small move. It was really much more of a mix change that resulted in a modest change. And the Tier 1 Common was a bit lower due to a higher DTA deduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Higher DTA deduction. Okay, thanks. And then, just curious, on the 4% reduction in assets, where are you seeing the opportunity to reduce balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking about overall balance sheet size coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and I'll tell you why I'm asking. If you look at the 17 or so times common leverage or you know assets divided by common equity, that's about in the range where I think you can rest over time, I'm just curious, how you think about the improving ROA and what's left on that balance sheet that's dragging that ROA down? I mean, it's a little different question than FICC improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A number of different questions in your question. Balance sheet was down this quarter, that was really more about client activity than anything. And we still remain comfortable in that 800 to $850 billion range that we are talking about. But the point about ROA is very important and we are very focused on it and to your point, it is about ensuring that we are deploying, redeploying capital out of, you know, kind of the capital heavier areas, and putting them behind our core institutional money management business and sales and trading business and in particular on the sales and trading side, our view is, as we continue to build out our footprint and our flow business, we're going to be able to drive more efficient utilization of the balance sheet and we are very focused on ROA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I guess it takes time, in other words, I think a simple question is where is the leverage being used? Like, it takes time to wean yourselves off of that, is that what I'm hearing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>There are two elements, very important as we said. In fixed income, we're in the first of a two-year steady build and it is about delivering consistency and dependability to clients which will increase our flow business and efficient utilization of the balance sheet. So that's one element of it. The other is we are systematically reducing the drag from legacy positions or as we're moving into more of a Basel III world, we'll be continuing to redeploy capital behind our core sales and trading business in the efficient areas, in the most efficient areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A simple last one on balance sheet is, the 10.5% Tier 1 common, I was just curious if you had any updated thoughts on Basel III compliance today and how that plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we've said before we remain very comfortable with respect to Basel both capital and liquidity. And have capacity to absorb the new rules with parent capital which you know is about 20 billion.</p>
          <p>Just to give you a bit of an update on Basel III, our RWA guidance is virtually unchanged &#x2013; essentially unchanged, same zip code from the commentary after the third quarter. So if you take our RWAs at 12/31, take our balance sheet under Basel III, RWAs would be up $240 billion, and then through passive mitigation kind of through the end of 2012 it would be down about $100 billion.</p>
          <p>And I guess the other factors to layer into how we think about Tier 1 common under Basel III, a couple items affecting capital. First, we have as you know, $7.8 billion of MUFG convertible to common, which is meaningful. We have the 14% Smith Barney buy-in in 2012 and the MCI associated with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. So if we take our consensus earnings, those factors, our 12/31 balance sheet under Basel III, the ratio at the end of 2012 would be between 8% and 10% which is why we say we are very comfortable with respect to Basel III.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any more specific financial targets? That was helpful, your commentary for the year ahead. I was wondering if we could get a little more meat on the bone. A lot of your peers have more specific financial targets and if you don't have a specific financial target, are you looking more at revenues or earnings or ROE or which metrics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we &#x2013; across the businesses I think we've &#x2013; you know, we gave you some more specifics on GWM, what we're looking for longer-term is this PBT margin at 20%, again I'll give you the caveat, market dependent. But we're continuing to execute on that plan as I went through. On the investment management side, you saw the improvements in particular this quarter and again, it's about building the core institutional money management business and being &#x2013; efficiently redeploying capital out of merchant banking, hedge funds, C investments to support that core institutional business. And within our Institutional Securities business, we have real strength in Investment Banking and equities, where on our steady build within fixed income it is about driving ROA and I think in the aggregate what we are looking at is overall we're very focused on what is ROE and delivering attractive returns for shareholders. So that's what we're driving. As James said we are outstanding still on any of these businesses, driving execution across them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd add is that last year we hired a lot of people. We hired a lot of very senior people, actually the weighted number of folks that we brought in, a lot of MDs and these folks are getting traction. We're not aggressively hiring right now, obviously, if a specific opportunity comes up we fill it. But we want to see some of the progress from those hires. And the improved client penetration we're getting particularly into some of our fixed income products. So this is a year where we are now digesting the expenses and if things go as we plan them to go, we'll see the returns come off those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know you said it's the first of two years of a build in the trading areas and you hired a lot of traders. Do you think it's working? What sort of conviction do you have about this hire for growth strategy within trading? Do you feel better or worse about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We remain very confident and comfortable with the strategy. If you &#x2013; if we look at third party data it would suggest that we are gaining market share in a number of the businesses. Now, the key is seeing that third party data translate into greater results. So when we look at kind of the drivers of the business in particular, this quarter, we think that we're seeing signs of progress, we're pleased with the steps we're taking, continuing to execute against the plan. But it was challenging being in a risk on/risk off market and so we had client activity, but trading facilitation, market making was limited and it is about both building up what we're doing and we do remain very much on track, on point in that regard and having a bit of a more constructive market.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about the investment banking outlook? And I guess I'm thinking we see a lot of equity deals getting done but coming off of a record revenue quarter, are you seeing enough potential activity filling the pipeline for strength to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So overall our investment pipelines do remain healthy across products and regions. It was a bit frustrating throughout the year to keep saying our pipeline is building and it was just a question of time seeing the transactions moving through the pipeline and I think you saw that in the fourth quarter. But the pipelines do remain healthy across products and globally.</p>
          <p>So on the M&amp;A front the pipeline's strong. We do expect the positive momentum that we experienced in 2010 to continue into 2011. We're seeing increased private equity activity and cross-border activity and emerging markets M&amp;A and it is very much about a lot of the factors we spoke about during the year with high corporate cash balances and now you know with increasingly improved corporate confidence.</p>
          <p>And on the equity side, the backlog does remain strong. And again, it's around the globe, Asia remains strong as does Europe and Latin America, we expect also to see more of the sponsor-led financings coming through the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and how about on the fixed income trading side of the business? I mean you've built up the business. What kind of market environment or assumptions are you making for how big this business should be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we're &#x2013; I think that we're looking for more of a &#x2013; you know we're not looking for a heroic move in the fixed income market. We're looking for a more muted or a more predictable environment. So you know in contrast to what was a pretty stark risk on risk off market this past quarter, the absence of that kind of whipsaw is what we need.</p>
          <p>We have two things, really, the backdrop of the environment, and it is not as though we are looking for another 2009 type environment. What we are looking for is, again, this absence of the risk on risk off, that had at its core a lot of policy-related events that drove activity. And so kind of a more you know benign environment and that enables us to really close the gap we have within fixed income.</p>
          <p>So if you look across our Institutional Securities business we have a top tier investment banking franchise, a very strong institutional equities business and what we're really just looking to do is close the gap within certain areas, not even across the board, within certain areas of fixed income, capitalizing on strengths we already have within fixed income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add also, we have an important commodities business the last couple of years, metals and agriculture have been major drivers of revenue for the industry, our historic strengths have been in gas and oil and I think as those markets are now starting to move, that business becomes more important to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I look at the wealth management business, one of the things that kind of jumps out at me is net interest income, you know, doubling plus year-over-year. But then I look at the deposit balance and it's essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. That implies in net interest margin expansion that we're not really seeing from other players. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that net interest income increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll check into that. My guess is there are two drivers behind that. One is, the business wasn't owned for 12-months, it was owned for 7-months, so you get the impact of the 50 plus billion dollars of deposits that sat on the Citi side in addition to the 50 that sat on the Morgan Stanley side. So you get 100 billion for the year. And the other is the growth in the lending businesses. You look at the margin book and I saw some of the online players reported their margin balances had grown pretty dramatically. We don't have as volatile a margin book as that but clearly with the rising equity markets, our margin business has grown and some of the lending and the spread you get on the lending product that we've been building out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the margin book the bulk of the lending within GWM still and I guess as you look forward is non-margin related lending something you try to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure the margin book is significant and you know but also we originate home mortgages and small business loans and other things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, finally, just trying to reconcile some of the items in the quarter, it looks as though ex-DVA you accrued compensation expense against some of the other gains? Am I thinking of that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yes, you are. Items like CICC are included as part of our revenue and we accrue comp against it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to go back to the DVA. It was so sizable, I was just hoping that maybe you could give us some metrics that could help us get some analytical clarity around the number. I mean, we've all been kind of conditioned to look through it and even so, when it's as sizable as this, you just want to really feel like you understand it. And given what we know happened to your cash bond spread and even though you've issued a lot of structured products it just seems like it was a very outsized move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us some of the underlying metrics to help us understand it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely, good question. There are a couple of things I mentioned briefly. So to expand upon them: first, the average outstanding balance was up almost about 10% from the third quarter, there was a lot of interest in this product so up almost about 10%; second, the weighted average maturity of the portfolio extended, and so the change in the ten-year spreads played a bigger role; and then about 20% of the overall DVA was due to the option of extending maturity that's embedded in certain of the notes.</p>
          <p>So on the metrics, if you go to WAM, that moved to nearly five years in the fourth quarter. It was 3.5 years when we last disclosed it in 2009. And so you know again focusing on the ten-year cash bond spreads this quarter, they tightened 56 basis points, versus 27 in the third quarter. I'm glad you pointed out, it is cash bond spreads because CBS was in only &#x2013; the ten year CBS was in only seven basis points. But that was pretty meaningful narrowing and to your point, with the WAM moving out, it became more relevant to look at the ten year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the WAM moved out partly because of the nature of what you issued, and also partly because there was some &#x2013; there is essentially some negative convexity built into this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was really by virtue of what we were issuing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just to tie it together, you were talking before about some of the monoline credit spread impacts. Is that related to this as well? Is that part of the 900 and some odd million, or is that separate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Completely separate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the clarity; that certainly helps. To the point that was brought up a minute ago on the compensation effect on the CICC, would comp &#x2013; do you believe that comp really would have been lower if you hadn't had the gains? The reason I ask is that, again, as we think about modeling out future earnings power, we need to really understand what your comp dollar needs are. And based on what we heard in the press and obviously a lot of that stuff can be &#x2013; can be wrong, it seems like the firm needed every dollar of comp that it had available to it. And so just &#x2013; I wonder if your comp dollars actually would have been less, even if you hadn't had the gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Guy, we -- you know, we're focused on balancing what we think is right for our shareholders and ensuring that we pay the right people the way we've got to pay them. The fact of the matter is, if we didn't have the revenue and we didn't have the earnings we would have adjusted it through our compensation. We've been very deliberate and very focused on that. But we wouldn't do it at a level where we thought we'd be putting significant risk into the franchise. We're also aware that these businesses aren't &#x2013; they don't start and begin on January 1 and close on December 31. They're multi-year processes. So you know we look at the total bucket of earnings, we look at the various charges that we make. You could you know make arguments that you could extract you know legal reserves, you could extract restructuring of businesses, whether it be FrontPoint or other businesses, we look at the total mix and then when we deal with what we've got on a net revenue basis, that's how we think about comps.</p>
          <p>So, you know, it's &#x2013; I can't kind of cherry pick it. I regard the CICC as good revenues generated through the wherewithal of folks at this firm and that's something we feel very comfortable compensating on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. In Asset Management in the quarter and you sort of spoke to this, the ratio of the payout to non-controlling interests as a percentage of the investment revenue that you showed, was a lot lower. It was about 28% in the fourth quarter, and it was almost half in the third. Can you just explain to us why the shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, you know, I think I'm going to need to get back to you on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough, it's sort of as we look forward and try to model revenues ahead it's just useful to have that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the final question I have for you is, was there any significant change in the cash versus equity component of &#x2013; or mix of compensation this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in our compensation, we &#x2013; we did increase the deferral. But we &#x2013; and when we talk about deferred comp we talk about both deferring cash and deferring stock and so the overall &#x2013; the overall mix was pretty much the same, with higher deferrals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

Just wanted to come back to the &#x2013; you know sort of the FICC build out and looking at some of the personnel changes and folks you've moved around.

          <p>No, I think I've said it a couple of times now. This is the first of a two year steady build. Colm left this seat a year ago and we've been really building out the team. It does take time but we are going to repeat it, it's the first of a two year steady build. I apologize, completed the first year of a two year steady build.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but sorry, just tying back to the other comment, I think James you made about sort of growth or head count, because you're not really hiring. So really, it's sort of net neutral on the year that you have sort of a build out going on but assuming there will be some turnover in the process, is that kind of how you're thinking about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I look at the businesses, I think in Institutional Securities, we hired about 70% of our total plan last year. We sort of pulled the curtain over it about in August. You know there are a couple of areas where we didn't quite get done what we wanted to get done and a couple of our support areas, particularly in risk and technology where, but these are very small numbers.</p>
          <p>In wealth management we're carrying something like 2,000 contractors working on the integration. I think that's now pretty much, if not running at peak, pretty much at peak and I think our financial advisor head count will stay in the band Ruth put out, 17.5 to 18.5. It may be down a couple of hundred from this year, it may not be. I wouldn't draw too much from that one way or the other, if it's up or down, as long as it stays in that band.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, some of the merchant banking businesses we've had a lot of success in, in Asia and in our infrastructure business but they're small numbers. So I think you're probably &#x2013; we haven't actually sat down and laid out our head count plan for the firm but would I say the aggregate picture would be roughly flat, I'd be surprised if it's up much. We're certainly no not anticipating any big RIF or anything of that nature.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay, that's helpful, thanks. Just coming back to the question on the net interest income in the bank. The other I guess thing that sort of popped out at us as we had noticed that is that the net interest income in the Institutional Securities business has been declining sort of at the same time. And we're just wondering if there's any connection between the two like transfer pricing of any sort or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's not a connection. In Institutional Securities as you know, it's more of a &#x2013; NIM is more of a banking book than a trading book concept, and so the cost in Institutional Securities is really driven by our trading and derivatives activities that have an interest component. So we think of that business holistically. There's not a link between the NIM discussion we would have there and the NIM in GW.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the way we report it in Wealth Management, we manage it internally, there are two separate &#x2013; there's the BDP, the deposit spreads and then there's the net interest margin on the core loan book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, the tax rate, can you give us any sort of comments on the go-forward? I mean it's been low and I understand it jumps around quarter to quarter depending on sort of levels of net income and credit and this and that that you could get. But you just look at it on the aggregate, you still generated $6 billion of pre-tax profit, a kind of small amount in 2010, and to the extent that goes up, do you have enough of these sort of shields to keep the tax rate unusually low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we do our tax planning annually. So if you just exclude the discrete items from 2010, the effective annual tax rate from continuing operations would have been about 28%. And as we look forward to 2011, we would just suggest that you look at the effective &#x2013; the statutory tax rate, so about 35%. Something less than 35% would be the right way to look at it for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last question. Given the charge on FrontPoint can you say where that's carried now on the books?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to, again, the backdrop is, our overall strategy in this area is to free up capital in merchant banking activities and hedge funds and we're continuing to do that. But with respect to FrontPoint specifically, we're continuing to restructure our ownership to a minority stake. Given the events last quarter and with the lower AUM, there were some changes to the deal terms. We did take a higher charge in the fourth quarter. It was about $126 million if I recall correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably to the extent that assets continue to flow out, that can continue to be revised, I guess, is the assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The carrying value as of the fourth quarter is $30 million just so you have that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay, perfect. Okay, appreciate it, thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. One follow-up on the Wealth Management business and the clarity around rates and markets, that's helpful.  If we look at what you have left in terms of consolidating the platforms, the remaining synergies, and I think the last time you guys gave the number you may have 400 million or 500 million left. If we just look at that and assume that that gets done at some point at the end of this year or beginning of next year, then if we just run those synergies through the model, based on what you can control, can you still get that pre-tax margin to like the mid-teen level, call it 15, 16, 17? And then basically whether it's the rate, the markets, what, you know the scenarios that you gave there would be able to push you above that 20% level? Because I'm just trying to figure out what you guys can still control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know I think you &#x2013; I went through the building blocks and I think you've just articulated it well. Getting through the spend is an important part of it. We're still very much on track with the platform for the third quarter of this year and moving the Morgan Stanley FAs over the third quarter. We'll be training the Smith Barney FAs through the fourth quarter and starting to move over again next year, so there is some spend that continues. That's an important element of it and building up the lending book, as we've talked about, is an important element of it to get non-compensable revenues to increase. So again, driving towards that 20% PBT margin over time, market dependent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the &#x2013; I mean, I know a lot of folks are very curious about the margin notes. We are, to be honest, it doesn't give us a whole lot of anxiety. This business used to have under $6 billion of revenues and had 7%, 8% margins. It now has revenues of over $12.5 billion. So, you understand fixed costs, you understand the arithmetic. In some normalized markets, frankly, that is not a big anxiety for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, where we're more focused is that it really helps us have a very attractively diversified revenue stream by business and product and geography and we've talked a lot on this call about capital. Some are more capital intensive. Businesses like GWM, Banking, Asset Management are more capital-light. So it's really, in the aggregate, the portfolio that is in our view one of the most important elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just based on your capital ratios and we'll all come up with our value, valuation for the buy-in, you know, for MSSB, but if you look at you know the amount of capital that you're going to generate through 2012 and if you look at just normal leverage ratios, do you have any sense in terms of how much you would be paying in equity versus cash or debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last one just on the fixed income side, on the legacy issues in terms of the monoline, like, what's the timing on that? And is there any way, I don't know, to either restructure it, just basically how much is that going to weigh on, you know, the earnings? And then, on the core business, is it, like, 2010 more getting the people in place from a products and then 2011 is more gaining traction with clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the monoline point it is a legacy exposure. It's going to take time to work out so I would just refer you to all the detail that's in the K and was in the Q last quarter. In terms of the &#x2013; your key issue there on terms of kind of the ongoing implementation in sales and trading, 2010 was about adding &#x2013; adding talent and structure around the way we cover clients and drive client relationships deeper. As we've talked about before, we have strength in a lot of our franchises across a lot of clients you know with this brand globally and the strengths that we have, it is just continuing to execute. And so adding talent to the platform was an important element of it but I wouldn't like to suggest we did one last year we're doing the other this way. We had signs of market share improvement in the fourth quarter, as I said, that we are driving to, to bottom line results that we can talk about hopefully, you know, in the not too distance future but we are consistently executing, adding talent and driving relationships across our clients and that's really what's very &#x2013; what's very important in the fixed income &#x2013; In the fixed income move, closing the gaps in certain of the areas, building on the strengths in many of the others.</p>
