    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. And welcome to SABMiller's First Half Results Presentation for our six months ended September 30th, this year. With me today, as usual, is Malcolm Wyman, our CFO.</p>
          <p>As usual, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements, which reflect the current best judgment of management, including risks and uncertainties. The company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So let's get started. Amid mixed trading and economic conditions, the group's delivered a strong financial performance during the first half of the financial year. We delivered improved volume trends in some markets. Group organic lager volumes were up 1%, driven by consumer spending and our own brand and marketplace initiatives. This growth is despite continuing constraints on beer consumers in many areas, compounded by the impact of excise increases, particularly in Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Our revenues benefited from selective price increases in the prior year. We benefited from favorable input cost trends in the first half, following forward purchases at the low end of the commodity cycle last year. However, there have been signs of moderate upward pressure again recently.</p>
          <p>Within our businesses, we've continued to generate fixed cost savings, and this enabled considerably higher marketplace investment in Africa and in South Africa; protection from margin pressure in Europe; and strong margin growth in Latin America and the U.S.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that the net effect of this was a positive movement in Group EBITA margin, which was up by 90 basis points. As a result, our organic constant currency EBITA was up 10%; adjusted EPS grew 16%; and our free cash flow was up 23% to $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>While depressed consumer spending and unemployment continue to affect the U.S. and Europe causing volume declines there, we've seen improving performances across some developing markets. You can see in this chart the improved moving annual volume trends for Africa, South Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The LatAm improvement would be more pronounced if it were not for the significant VAT increase we've had to pass on to consumers in Colombia.</p>
          <p>These trends follow, in part, from investment for growth in capacity; and in extensions to our business footprint in Africa and China, for example; and stepped up marketing expenditure across the group outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Local brand portfolios retain strong leadership positions in most markets and have weathered downturns or slowdowns. We are well positioned to gain further momentum as the economic cycle improves in future. Indeed, the group's medium-term growth prospects remain strong due to our longer term embedded growth profile, as well as our continuing focus on the ground on leading local brands and commercial management.</p>
          <p>Turning now to a review of our divisional performances, in Latin America, first, economic improvement and our own commercial initiatives have helped performance. But lager volumes were marginally down overall, reflecting the impact of the increased beer taxes in Colombia. Poor weather and dry days due to elections were also factors in Colombia, and the economic recovery there has, thus far, mainly favored durable goods.</p>
          <p>However, Peru posted robust volume growth. Growth in Ecuador continued, but it's been affected by recent political unrest and government restrictions on the sale of alcohol.</p>
          <p>We continue to expand our brand and pack portfolios to capture new consumption occasions. Examples are the launch of a second lite beer, Poker Ligera, in Colombia to complement Aguila Lite, and the relaunch of Pilsen Callao in Peru in an antique green bottle, both at a price premium to mainstream. We're also developing our international premium segment with launches of MGD in Colombia and Peru and Miller Lite in Panama.</p>
          <p>In Honduras and El Salvador, via portfolio enhancements and trade management, we've gained share in alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks in a difficult operating environment with lower volumes.</p>
          <p>And despite the economic and regulatory headwinds, we grew EBITA and raised our operating margin by over 2 percentage points to 22.7%, largely driven by continued cost efficiency improvements, to which I'll return in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>I should mention that at the end of this year, Barry Smith, our Region President, will be retiring from SABMiller after 26 years. We're grateful to Barry for his sustained contribution to the group's success in senior positions in South Africa, Poland, and the U.S., before leading our LatAm region to become the most profitable in the group. Karl Lippert, who will take Barry's place, has been with the group since 1992 in senior positions in South Africa, Europe, and most recently in Colombia, where he's led with great vision and vigor.</p>
          <p>As regards MillerCoors in the United States, industry trading conditions have remained difficult, affected principally by high unemployment, particularly amongst those demographic groups to which beer consumption is skewed. Notwithstanding the subdued economy, pricing in the U.S. beer industry has remained firm.</p>
          <p>The late stage integration processes within the JV are progressing, with synergy realization on target and dropping to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors has improved its segment share in premium lites, led by Coors Lite, and more recently complemented by a much improved performance by Miller Lite following a range of upgrades to its brand marketing and packaging.</p>
          <p>The overall category has been in low to mid single-digit decline recently, feeling the pressure from high unemployment, in particular.</p>
          <p>In the craft segment, MillerCoors has had great success with Blue Moon, extending distribution, developing the craft in a can concept, and adding new seasonal extensions. Earlier this year, to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the craft and import segments, MillerCoors announced the formation of a new unit, the Tenth and Blake Beer Company, which will drive growth in its imports and crafts portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Europe, lager volumes declined 5% as the beer industry continued to experience weak economic conditions across the region. The first quarter was particularly challenging, with the Smolensk tragedy affecting sales in Poland and with flooding generally across the region. This was followed by a better, exceptionally warm second quarter.</p>
          <p>Detractors from profitability, particularly in Poland and the Czech Republic, included reduced volumes and, therefore, operating deleverage, consumer downtrading, and channel shifts to and within the off-trade; some cyclical, some driven by competitive pricing behavior. Lingering excise impacts also played a part.</p>
          <p>Conversely, we are seeing early hopeful signs of an improved picture in Russia, notwithstanding volume pressures from a steep excise rise and some abatement of pressure in markets with easier comparatives, such as Romania.</p>
          <p>The focus on portfolio profitability and on cost management is driving improved performance in our more mature markets, such as Italy, Slovakia, and the Netherlands, while the UK has also seen a strong rise in profitability on its growing premium brand sales.</p>
          <p>Overall in the region, margin pressures were largely offset by reduced commodity costs in the half. And we continue to seek further cost reduction opportunities including, for example, the intention to close a brewery in Romania, which we've just announced today. Marketing expenditure was higher than in the prior year as we continued to invest in our leading power brands.</p>
          <p>South African economy, helped by a successful FIFA World Cup, has bounced back following a significant downturn in 2009. Consumer confidence has lagged the GDP turnaround but is, nevertheless, improving, as evidenced by a good recovery in beer and soft drink sales, particularly in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In beer, the benefits of moderate price increases, input cost deflation, and productivity savings have been redeployed into our marketing and sales endeavors, with more and higher quality investment going into the trade. This is paying off with evidence that the beer category is regaining share of alcohol and that in key aspects of in-trade execution, SAB's lead versus the competition is widening. As a result, our beer market share stabilized earlier this year, with trailing three months' share higher than the trailing six and 12-month figures.</p>
          <p>Castle Lite was repositioned a year ago in the local premium segment on an integrated through-the-line theme of cold refreshment. The consumer response has been strong, with steadily improving volumes and segment share. Our mainstream portfolio of Castle Lager, Hansa Pilsner, and Carling Black Label has also gained momentum as a result of focused marketing campaigns.</p>
          <p>In soft drinks, volume performance improved, 3% growth for the half, with better sales mix and efficiency, both boosting profitability. All aspects of market execution are improving and driving profit growth. And you'll be aware of the broad-based black economic empowerment transaction we announced last year, called Zenzele, for which today we've announced the payment of our first equity dividends to retail customers, to employees, and to our SAB Foundation.</p>
          <p>Our African footprint, comprising a broad portfolio of markets, has continued to deliver growth. Performances were particularly strong in Uganda and Mozambique, driven both by more affordable and more premium brands, and in Zambia, where we are seeing the benefits of a lower beer excise.</p>
          <p>Tanzania delivered a notable performance with stepped up sales execution, particularly in our growing premium portfolio, and despite the loss of some licensed brands. On the other hand, we faced continuing economic and supply chain constraints in Angola, as well as regulatory headwinds in Botswana.</p>
          <p>While we expect in Angola to return to growth in soft drinks and to continue the ramp up in beer volumes, the outlook in Botswana is still clouded by the prospect of a rising social levy.</p>
          <p>Across our African business as a whole, we are focusing consistently on beer brand portfolio enhancement, with extended price ladders to grow volume and value. We're introducing more affordable product lines at lower price points, while driving our local premium brands. We're exploiting recent investments in capacity, and actively expanding into other beverage categories in order to capitalize on our scale in operations and distribution.</p>
          <p>For this half year, we've included Delta in Zimbabwe back into our financials as an associate given the dollarization of the Zimbabwean currency in 2009, and the economic stabilization which succeeded that. The business has considerable growth potential from its current base.</p>
          <p>In Asia, volume growth for the half has accelerated with rising operating margins. The Chinese beer market benefited from a good summer peak. CR Snow continued to outpace the market with the Snow brand, led by performance in the Central and Northeast regions. We estimate that the Snow brand itself now constitutes close to 20% of the Chinese beer market.</p>
          <p>Marketing emphasis on Snow's newer premium variants has been rewarded. Recent efforts have been focused on outdoor promotions for the Brave the World variant, which is shown here on the slide, involving endurance events tracking the route of the Long March. It is a campaign well aligned to the Chinese nationalist sentiment, which underpins the brand's positioning.</p>
          <p>Pricing, however, has remained stagnant, while marketing spend and trade promotions are up. Against this backdrop, we continue to lead the long-term industry consolidation in China.</p>
          <p>In India, we are seeing increasingly profitable growth in most states led by a successful activation of Haywards 5000 in the strong beer segment. However, regulatory constraints persist in certain key markets, such as Andhra Pradesh, impacting our overall volumes and share in the country. The net result in the half was some improvement on the prior year, but regulatory hurdles remain.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, our toehold in Vietnam is starting to show encouraging signs, with growth in our mainstream brand, Zorok. And in June, a new Greenfield brewery was commissioned in Australia by Pacific Beverages to support the future growth of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, I shall give a brief update on the group's four strategic priorities. These have remained consistent and relevant for over four years now. Over the past decade, we have created a balanced portfolio of businesses, with leading growth characteristics. Our M&amp;A approach is disciplined, with firm economic value approach and a focus on businesses and markets in which we can add value through the application of our skills and experience.</p>
          <p>Looking at the other strategic priorities: first, developing strong, relevant brand portfolios that win in the local market. You've heard us talk about our local brand portfolios to which we attribute success in category building and market share gains over recent years. In this regard, we focus our attention in five key areas.</p>
          <p>The first is the expansion of the category across new consumer segments and occasions. Examples include the new affordable beer segment that we're building in Africa, a large opportunity as consumers migrate from cheaper informal alcohol. We're using local inputs and achieving 30% lower beer prices to the consumer, while maintaining our margins. Other opportunities include attracting more female consumers with new tailored offerings, and developing lighter beers and smaller packages in Latin America to offer greater refreshment and build beer drinking occasions with meals and on-the-go.</p>
          <p>The second focus area is in premium brands where, despite the economic downturn, excellent progress is being made with our local premium brands across regions as varied as the U.S. and Africa. And we continue to build at a deliberate pace in the international brand segment.</p>
          <p>Third is our focus on leading mainstream brands with strong traditional equities and large-scale positions. For example, Castle Lager in South Africa has been rejuvenated and the recent World Cup offered a platform for further in-trade investment for the brand. In Czech, we've extended the Gambrinus platform with an 11-degree variant, priced at a small premium at the top of mainstream. And in China, Snow's consolidation and leadership of the industry continues.</p>
          <p>Our fourth focus is in revenue management, which we expect to be a leading driver of profitable growth in both developing and mature markets. Brand, pack, and channel pricing are carefully designed to drive demand into the category and then up the value ladder. There is recent evidence of this in the U.S., it's a strategic focus in Europe, and is an increasing feature of our brand and pack portfolios in Latin America.</p>
          <p>And fifth is segmenting and differentiating our service offering in key channels. A good example comes from here in the UK, where Miller brands is using consumer insights to foster collaboration with our large and discriminating chain customers. This benefits both supplier and retailer in cash margins; footfall, driven by bespoke brand activations; and brand and outlet image enhancement. This has increased retailer attention to our brands, particularly for Peroni Nastro Azzurro. In a recent survey of leading UK off-trade chains, we were recognized as the best cash margin provider within our peer group.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our third strategic priority, namely to constantly raise the profitability of our businesses sustainably. Despite the marginal decline in lager volumes in Latin America, EBITA from the region grew by 10% in organic constant currency. This was underpinned by selected price increases, lower variable costs, and fixed cost reductions, and despite an increase in marketing spend throughout the region.</p>
          <p>Mix improvement was also a driver as we progress with the development of an upper mainstream segment, offering an affordable consumer trade-up opportunity with higher margins. In Colombia specifically, we've managed to grow EBITA and further expand our margins in spite of the volume decline, which is an admirable performance.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we've optimized our service model and route to market, and improved our fixed cost productivity. This has been achieved by, amongst other items, the closure of the Bogota brewery at the end of June, by maintenance cost reductions, savings in operating lease rentals, and in head count. All of the above have further enhanced our margin by 210 basis points to 22.7% for the half year.</p>
          <p>And at MillerCoors, the management have been able to realize significant synergies and cost savings. Since the JVs formation, MillerCoors have delivered over $560 million, and they're ahead of schedule for total savings of $750 million per annum by the end of 2012. The brands are now brewed closer to the customers, with considerable network savings. And they're seeing other non-organizational cost savings in procurement, operating efficiencies, and commercial tactical spend, and they expect the remaining benefits to come from those areas.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our fourth and final strategic priority, to leverage our skills and global scale. We're proceeding at a steady pace with a wide-ranging business capability program that we introduced a year ago. This relies on a combination of standardization, outsourcing, and centralization. We're standardizing back-office support processes and selected sales distribution and manufacturing systems. This will result in a globally integrated platform for transaction processing and information access within finance, human resources, procurement, and IT.</p>
          <p>We are outsourcing specific back-office processes. And we're centralizing specialist functions to reap efficiency savings, at either, the global or the regional level, in procurement; in IT, parts of treasury, and in Europe, manufacturing and supply chain as well.</p>
          <p>We've reached a number of significant milestones in the program thus far. In Latin America, good progress has been made on a common customer-facing IT system, which is live in Peru and serving over 150,000 outlets there, and partially complete in Colombia. Lessons from this development are being carried over into our European business. In South Africa and Ecuador and Panama, working capital benefits are being realized from supply chain projects. And in June, our South African business and our corporate head office went live on the global platform for back-office transaction processing, which will in time be rolled out widely to simplify and standardize information and processes, and ultimately reduce costs.</p>
          <p>Under a group global contract with Genpact, routine finance and accounting services have been outsourced in South Africa, Poland, and Central America, with preparations underway in Italy, the Netherlands, and Colombia. Trinity, our global procurement operation, is now established in Switzerland and is purchasing all brewing materials for the group, with significant benefits anticipated. Other procurement categories will be added progressively.</p>
          <p>The overall program is on track to be completed by 2014, with our outlook unchanged for $300 million per annum in cost savings and efficiency benefits by then. Exceptional costs are expected to be higher by some $160 million in constant currency, associated with design and implementation, enhanced program scope, and an extended timeline. There's also a potential currency effect and some $100 million in incremental CapEx. More on this in a few minutes from Malcolm.</p>
          <p>With the business capability program comes the opportunity for us to evolve our organizational structure, enabling country managers to focus more on what's really important: local consumers, customers, and other stakeholders, including government and communities, to protect our license to trade. The centralization and standardization at either a regional or global level of support functions, procurement, and other non-core aspects of the business will support this local commercial focus, while enabling cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>The most significant change so far is in our Europe division, as you heard presented by Alan Clark in September. This is not new art, but it does mark a substantial change for our country management teams, who will now focus principally on the creation and management of demand. The changes require strong, centralized, functional talent pools, with a central operating organization responsible for our supply and replenishment cycle. This central function is now contracted through service level agreements to the country teams and, in the transition, business continuity is assured.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand over to Malcolm Wyman to review our financial performance. Malcolm?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good day to everyone. As in the past, my presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis as this reflects our underlying performance and profitability before foreign exchange translation impacts.</p>
          <p>The group has delivered good adjusted earnings per share growth in terms of all our major currencies in the first six months. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 16%, while strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 23% was achieved in pounds sterling. The interim dividend is 19.5 U.S. cents per share, which represents an increase of 15% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Despite challenging trading conditions in a number of our key markets, we delivered a strong performance in the first half of the year with lager volumes up 1.5% on an organic basis. Tough trading conditions in Europe and North America and marginally lower volumes in Latin America were more than offset by good growth in China, Africa, and South Africa, particularly during the second quarter. Organic constant currency revenue grew 4.5%, driven by prior year price increases and organic volume growth.</p>
          <p>EBITA grew significantly, up 10.2% on an organic constant currency basis. The group's EBITA margin increased 90 basis points through good revenue growth, lower raw material input costs, and real fixed cost savings. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate and lower profit attributable to minorities arising from our acquisition of the 28.1% interest in our Polish subsidiary, contributing to the 16% growth in earnings per share in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Group revenue grew 4.5% on an organic constant currency basis, and all regions achieved revenue per hectoliter growth over this period. In Latin America, revenue per hectoliter grew 2%, predominantly due to price increases in the second half of the prior year, notably in Colombia following the 11% sales tax increase on beer. Revenue also benefited from positive lager mix, driven by the growth in the upper mainstream Aguila, Lite brand in Colombia and Miller Genuine Draft in Panama.</p>
          <p>Europe achieved revenue per hectoliter growth of 4%, despite a decline in larger volumes and continued downtrading. This top line revenue growth was largely driven by the significant excise-related price increases taken in the fourth quarter of last year in Russia, and also the Czech Republic. MillerCoors grew revenue per hectoliter by 3% in North America following firm net price increases taken over the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In Africa, revenue per hectoliter in our subsidiary businesses increased by 9% aided by prior year price increases and positive mix benefits from good growth in our premium segment, particularly in Tanzania and Mozambique. Revenue per hectoliter grew by 3% in Asia, assisted by both the expansion of the Snow brands premium offerings and geographic mix benefits. And South Africa delivered revenue per hectoliter growth of 5% following price increases taken in both beer and soft drinks in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We delivered strong organic constant currency EBITA growth of 10.2% in the first half of the year, notwithstanding double-digit EBITA growth over the same period last year. Volume and pricing benefits previously mentioned, together with a reduction in raw material input costs and the achievement of real fixed cost savings, all assisted in driving this growth. All regions, other than Europe, increased their EBITA and contributed to the strong group EBITA performance, which was aided by significant synergy and cost savings in North America and good raw material and fixed cost savings in both Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>We continued to increase marketing spend behind our strong brand equities during the half year. In the event, EBITA grew 13% on a reported basis as our key operating currency strengthened against the U.S. dollar versus the first half of the prior year, in particular, the South African rand and the Colombian peso, which more than offset weaker currencies in both Africa, and also in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we achieved strong organic constant currency EBITA growth of 10% despite a slight decline in volumes. Prior year price increases, lower raw material input costs, and ongoing fixed cost savings all contributed to the strong performance.</p>
          <p>Costs of good sold and raw material input costs were both down high single-digits on a constant currency dollar per hectoliter basis in the first half. Lower barley prices, favorable currency positions, and reduced freight costs all contributed to this reduction in cost of goods sold in LatAm.</p>
          <p>Lower year-on-year fixed costs in Colombia and Peru helped deliver real fixed cost savings in the first half. The combination of these factors supported strong EBITA growth and led to a 200 basis points increase in EBITA margin, despite increased marketing investment across all countries.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in Peru was driven by positive economic conditions, along with strong sales execution. But this was offset by lager volume declines in Colombia. In Ecuador, sales and distribution initiatives led to lager volume growth of 4%. Exceptionally heavy rainfall impacted soft drink sales across Central America, with volumes down 2% at the end of the first six months.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the ongoing difficult economic conditions continued to impact the business with lager volumes down 5% on an organic basis, although favorable weather across Central and Eastern Europe assisted sales in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency EBITA declined by 4%, driven by reduced volumes and downtrading across our key markets. This was partially offset by a significant reduction in brewing raw material costs and improved production efficiencies, along with tight fixed cost management. Notwithstanding the challenging environment, we have continued to invest behind our core brands right across the region.</p>
          <p>Poland experienced a particularly difficult first quarter with alcohol sales restrictions for nine days following the death of the President and severe weather conditions leading to flooding. There are, however, signs that economic conditions are improving with growth in both GDP and retail sales forecast for the 2010 calendar year.</p>
          <p>The Czech Republic and Russia have been affected by significant excise-related price increases, downtrading, and a shift away from on-premise sales as high levels of unemployment and tax increases put pressure on disposable income.</p>
          <p>The results of our North American segment comprise our 58% share of the results from the MillerCoors' joint venture and 100% of Miller Brewing International. On this basis, North America delivered strong EBITDA growth for the half of 27% despite volume declines.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors' lager sales, as well as sales to retailers, excluding contract brewing, both decreased by 3% for the half year as the overall beer market continued to contract under difficult economic conditions with unemployment remaining at high levels. In this context, it is encouraging to report double-digit growth in MillerCoors' Tenth and Blake crafts and imports division, with strong growth in both Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's. The realization of significant synergy and cost savings, which led to cost of goods sold and other fixed cost benefits, together with robust net pricing, resulted in EBITDA growth of 21% for MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors has delivered synergy benefits totaling $119 million in the first six months of the year. A total of $564 million of annualized synergy and cost savings have been realized since the initiation of the joint venture on 1 July of 2008. The half year results of our Africa division includes our share of Delta, our associates in Zimbabwe, following the effectiveness &#x2013; effective dollarization of the economy in 2009 and the subsequent stabilization of the local economy.</p>
          <p>Lager volumes grew by 11%, or 7% excluding Zimbabwe. Double-digit volume growth was achieved in Uganda, Mozambique, and Angola, underpinned by capacity expansions largely completed at the end of last year. Tanzania's lager volumes were in line with the prior year, which was a notable performance following the withdrawal of certain licensed brands with effect from March 2010.</p>
          <p>Soft drinks volumes increased by 5% on an organic basis, or 1% excluding Zimbabwe. Other alcoholic beverages grew by 34%, and 5% excluding Zimbabwe, reflecting the impact of the large traditional beer business in that country.</p>
          <p>EBITA increased by 11% on an organic constant currency basis. The strong volume and revenue growth was partly offset by higher raw material costs, largely as a result of weaker local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, marketing costs increased to support the launch of new brands in existing and in new markets. As expected, our EBITA margins declined further during the first half, reflecting the impact of higher capacity-related fixed costs following significant capacity investments which are yet to be fully utilized.</p>
          <p>In Asia, lager volumes grew by 10% on an organic basis, and organic constant currency EBITA increased by 22% with strong performances from CR Snow, our associate in China, along with India, and also Vietnam.</p>
          <p>Despite adverse weather conditions in the first quarter, lager volumes in China grew strongly in the second half and by 9% in the half on an organic basis. The majority of growth coming from the North-East and Central regions, CR Snow gained market share through a combination of higher sales and marketing investments and the expansion of the premium segment. India's volumes and EBITA benefited from cycling weak prior year comparatives, which were impacted by adverse regulatory issues across a number of our key States. The joint venture in Australia experienced volume declines, the result of increased competitor activity in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, lager volumes grew by 3% following early signs of economic recovery and the continued increase in our market-facing investments. The 2010 FIFA World Cup helped drive sales, which partially offset the lack of a peak Easter trading period in the first quarter. Soft drinks also grew volumes by 3%, benefiting from good weather in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency revenue increased by 8%, as did EBITA, prior year pricing in both beer and soft drinks, along with volume growth, contributing to the revenue performance. Reduced discounts and positive mix benefits in our soft drinks businesses contributed to the EBITA growth.</p>
          <p>Investments in sales and marketing behind our key brands was increased, with new product and packaging innovation across both on and off-premise channels, and additional marketing in relation to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to input costs, raw material input costs for the half year were down mid single-digits versus the prior year on a constant currency, U.S. dollar per hectoliter basis. Most regions benefited from lower brewing raw material costs, primarily due to lower underlying barley and hop prices. In addition, certain key markets benefited from favorable currency moves as their local currencies strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. Cost of goods sold were down low single-digits as higher diesel costs and increased sales activity drove distribution costs higher.</p>
          <p>Total exceptional charges of $285 million have been taken against profit before tax in the first six months of the year. Our business capability program-related exceptional costs are $155 million in the first half of the year as we continued to streamline finance, human resources, IT, and procurement activities through the deployment of global systems. $126 million of exceptional charges relates to the Black Economic Empowerment program in South Africa for non-cash IFRS 2 share-based payment charges relating to the retailer and employee components of the scheme and associated costs.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs of $4 million primarily relate to the Group's share of MillerCoors' severance costs and contract termination charges incurred in the integration and restructuring program.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the developments overall in the business capability program. Progress with Trinity, our Group buying operation, our European regional manufacturing company, and with major sales and distribution systems implementations in Latin America, and support systems in South Africa are especially significant.</p>
          <p>The design effort for many of the front office processes is nearing completion. The rollout of a complete systems platform in Europe and Latin America will start next year. However, exceptional charges will be impacted by higher design and implementation costs; a one year extension to the program timeline; and some scope enhancements. In combination, over the five years of the program, we expect these factors to add about 160 million to the costs. In addition, the impact of currencies, in particular the strong rand on South Africa-based spend, may add around $40 million, dependent upon currency moves.</p>
          <p>Exceptional charges were 342 million last year and in financial 2011, we expect the charge to be around 15% below this. We then expect charges to decline from this level by some 40% in each of financial 2012 and financial 2013, with a final charge in financial 2014 at a similar level to that of financial 2013.</p>
          <p>Financial benefits remain encouraging. Estimates of annual cost and efficiency benefits remain broadly in line with the original objective, being 100 million in financial 2012; $200 million in financial 2013; and $300 million in financial 2014. Although, in the near-term, phasing of delivery in the current year means that financial 2011 benefits are expected to be nearer $30 million to $40 million, rather than the original 50 million objective we had set for the current year.</p>
          <p>The same factors I mentioned earlier that are pushing up operating costs will lead to additional capital expenditure of around $100 million. However, working capital inflows continue to be strong. In the first half of this year, aggregate working capital inflows from the program have already exceeded our original objective in aggregate of $350 million, which we only expected to be achieved by financial 2012.</p>
          <p>Normalized EBITDA, which includes dividends from the MillerCoors' joint venture, was up 12% on prior year as a result of increased operating profit and lower cash expenditure on exceptional items, together with an increase in dividends from MillerCoors. With a continued focus on improving working capital, we generated a cash inflow of $90 million in the first six months of the year, following the $300 million improvement in working capital cash flow achieved in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of $614 million was 125 million lower than the first six months of the prior year cycling capacity-related capital expenditure in Europe and Africa last year. Free cash flow improved by $234 million in the first half of the year, benefiting from improved working capital, reduced investments in joint ventures, together with increased dividends from MillerCoors. Adjusted net finance costs increased in the first half, largely due to adverse foreign exchange movements on non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt.</p>
          <p>The Group's effective tax rate of 29% was 40 basis points lower than that of the prior year, driven by continued tax efficiencies and changes in the geographic mix of profits.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position at 30 September has decreased from the financial 2010 year end, as a result of our strong cash flow, though offset to some extent by the appreciation of some of our major currencies against the U.S. dollar impacting the value of debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our financial structure continues to strengthen, with gearing falling to 36.8% and interest cover up to 9.1 times.</p>
          <p>Our access to liquidity remains strong with committed headroom available to the Group in excess of US$3 billion as at the 30th of September. Our weighted average interest rate at 30 September, 2010 has increased slightly to 6.1% from 5.7% as at 31 March, 2010. This has been driven by increases in interest rates in Africa and Latin America, as well as the repayment of low interest rate short-term floating rate debt from our strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>The pie chart on the slide shows our net debt profile by currency after the impact of derivatives. As you can see, we continue to maintain an appropriate and balanced net debt profile given the spread of our businesses. As we report in U.S. dollars, we also keep a proportion of debt in that currency.</p>
          <p>Our maturity profile remains conservative, with the majority of our debt maturing after three years. The increase in debt repayable within one year reflects the inclusion of a US$600 million bond, which is maturing in July 2011. We have sufficient headroom available to repay all debt falling due in the next two years in terms of undrawn corporate committed bank facilities, cash resources, and in-country banking facilities.</p>
          <p>Coming to the financial outlook for the current financial year, although the GDP outlook for our emerging markets in 2010 continues to point to an improvement in economic conditions, consumer spending patterns across our key markets are expected to remain mixed.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that raw material input cost benefits will moderate over the second half, with full year input costs down low single-digits. The recent increase in international barley prices will have a limited impact on brewing raw material costs in the current financial year as our barley requirements are substantially fulfilled through existing supplier contracts.</p>
          <p>Cash generation will continue to be a focus, although, given the significant improvements in the prior year, the full-year working capital inflow will be less than the amount in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Full-year capital expenditure is anticipated to be approximately US$1.3 billion as we continue to work towards our objective of reducing capital expenditure to US$1.1 billion over the next three years.</p>
          <p>Finance costs for the second half are expected to be slightly lower than those of the first half.</p>
          <p>Taking into account the current composition of the Group, our effective tax rate is expected to be 29% for the current financial year.</p>
          <p>And now, to conclude, I'll hand back again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. And so, to conclude, the medium-term outlook for the Group remains strong, both on the top and on the bottom line. Although consumer spending remains subdued, a trend of incremental improvement in economic conditions across most of our emerging markets is expected to be maintained.</p>
          <p>We will continue with our policy of selective price increases, and will continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and our productivity and efficiency initiatives, albeit at a slower rate than in the first six months of the year.</p>
          <p>We are selectively increasing investment behind our brands to ensure that we are well placed for any improvement in trading conditions.</p>
          <p>We are confident that our commercial strategies are the right ones. Our brand equities remain strong, and our global footprint is an advantage, and we are, therefore, well positioned for future growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, we'll be happy to take any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Graham. Morning, Malcolm. Two questions, please. The first one, maybe for Malcolm; if you look out to fiscal year '12, Malcolm, and at current raw material spot prices and FX prices, are you &#x2013; would you be able to give us some guidance as to what the outlook is for fiscal year '12 in input costs and cost of goods sold?</p>
          <p>And the second one relating to Africa; am I right in thinking that the ramp up in costs in Africa actually started in the second half of last year, so as we look forward to the second half of this year the cost base should be more or less stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just covering the import costs first in F'12, there's a number of issues I think we need to just touch on. First of all, input prices, as represented by barley and malt prices, have spiked up over the last few months as a result of the barley and wheat harvest problems in Russia and in Northern Europe and that has a knock-on effect throughout the other major continents, but obviously not to the same extent.</p>
          <p>Now, looking into F'12, we do have a significant, although not the major portion of our barley and malt, covered by committed contracts and hedges, so we do have some mitigation against those from the committed contracts.</p>
          <p>But when we take into account current spot prices, we also look at the fact that many of our markets are dependent upon the southern hemisphere harvests, which are due to come over the course of the next few months. And at this stage, as best as we can see, weather conditions and patterns seem to be relatively normal, so barring anything happening between now and then, we are expecting reasonably normal harvest conditions in the southern hemisphere.</p>
          <p>So, we would expect that, on balance, we will see an increase in our brewing raw material prices. But we have committed contracts in our packaging raw materials, and they are at more stable prices. So, looking forward as an overall cost of goods sold, we do expect an increase but it's at a manageable level and we think it would be somewhere in a low single-digit increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thank you very much, Malcolm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question about Africa, I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. The increases in capacity came in during the course of last year, and some of them were in the second half of last year so there'll still be an annualizing effect of the take-on of those costs depressing margins in the second half. But there's nothing more coming on, in the sense we're not building any more breweries right now.</p>
          <p>Obviously, to offset that annualization effect is the fact that we are ramping up volumes through those new facilities. And, in fact, the growth through those new facilities is by and large pretty gratifying so that should start to make margins recover.</p>
          <p>I should also point out that Zimbabwe has been added into the mix, and that has a current operating margin lower than the average for the rest of Africa so that tends to depress the average as a whole. But, again, the Zim margin should rise rapidly given their volume growth and operating leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of A&amp;P expenditure in Africa, Graham, should we be expecting, again, a year-on-year increase in H2 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think so. There's no reason for us to be pulling back on that. I think that &#x2013; you have to remember that A&amp;P in Africa is a very low level, so the percentage increases are quite high because the base is very low. But Africa's becoming a bit more competitive around the scene and so I think it's appropriate for us to pump-up our marketing levels, keep them up.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about pricing initiatives as we think about the second half of this fiscal year. It seems like you're somewhat optimistic that there's more room for pricing. But I was just curious, in the landscape, particularly of the U.S. and Europe with volumes being weak, if you feel there's an ability to take pricing and potentially lose some continued volume as a result of taking that pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say we're particularly optimistic. We're not pushing through dramatic price increases. We're certainly recovering cost increases, and in the U.S. you'll be aware that pricing has been relatively firm. But the big feature of pricing in the U.S. has been the closure of the gaps between the sub-premium segment and the premium segment and that has affected the mix quite dramatically, which has had a beneficial effect on margins, as we've outlined.</p>
          <p>The fall price increases in the U.S. are by and large through, so that's out in the market. As far as Europe is concerned, pricing action there is not aggressive. But again, selectively around the piece, we believe that we have the power to push through increases as necessary. There has been very substantial downtrading in Europe, and obviously we're cognizant of that. You don't see that in frontline price increase movements, but you see it in price mix movements, and obviously we're conscious of that, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess just as a follow-up to that, with the input costs, raw material costs seeming a bit more favorable, do you think there is a risk, with competition and how the environment globally is behaving with respect to pricing, that it may not be as firm knowing that some of the brewers may not have to take price increases to cover cost increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to generalize around the world because we don't face the same competitors in different parts of the world and the influences are different in different parts of the world. Pricing in the U.S. remains firm, and I think is set to remain so. In other parts of the world, the situation is very different; the competitors are very different.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Hales from Evolution Securities. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. Three questions, if I can. Firstly, Graham, maybe just jumping back on to Trevor's question on A&amp;P, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more broadly about how we should think about A&amp;P spend globally in the business, looking into the back end of F'11 and into F'12.</p>
          <p>And specifically perhaps in relation to South Africa, given we're now lapping last year's significant up-weighting behind the core four, should we see some slowdown in the rate of spend? Or are we going to see that high rate of spend in South Africa maintained?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on Europe, and I note in the statement and on your comments on the call you talk about improved macro conditions in Poland, obviously, as you've just said, downtrading has been an issue; are you starting to feel that the worst of the downtrading has happened? Just trying to get a feel as to whether you feel the worst is past in that region.</p>
          <p>And then finally, maybe one for Malcolm. Just on the minorities charge, Malcolm, I was surprised it was quite so low in the half year. I know the Polish minority exited; was there anything else in there that held that minority charge back at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps starting with that last question, in the minority charge there were a number of things there. In one of our countries where we have a minority, there was a loss as we started developing the business, and so there was a negative that went in to the minorities, so I think that's probably the only thing. Otherwise, it's just really the removal of the charge for the Polish minorities; no growth in some of the other minorities; and then a negative in one of the charges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I assume that was in Africa, Malcolm, somewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on your other questions, South African marketing, I don't see that that'll come back as a percentage. In fact, I think it may continue to rise slightly. We are still investing strongly behind the brands in South Africa; it's a very competitive situation. And I think the rate of increase will not be maintained, but I don't foresee a pullback in that.</p>
          <p>South Africa is starting to get to the sort of average marketing expenditure as a percentage of revenue that we see in other emerging markets, having been at a much lower level in the past. So, I think we're coming in to the right territory, and I don't think we're going to go back from that.</p>
          <p>As far as Europe is concerned, yes, I don't know whether we've seen the worst of it. As I say, I'm hoping that in Europe things have pretty much bottomed now in volume.</p>
          <p>Downtrading is hard to call. A lot of downtrading is related to channel mix and move from on-premise into off-premise, and that is very much a characteristic of harder times. The price gap between on-premise and off-premise is very high in terms of consumer prices, obviously, and so people tend to stay at home more. So I think that in Europe one could reasonably hope that the second half that we're now going into will represent a bottoming in volume expectations and in downtrading, but it's too soon to call. We've been waiting for that for some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pitcher from Redburn Partners. Please proceed with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, please. On Asia, you showed a certainly better than I'd expected margin performance. I'm just wondering, because by the looks of it, China resources actually saw some small margin contraction in their first half; I'm just wondering whether that was because China margins improved into the third quarter, or whether it's an accounting difference, or whether the other assets in Asia saw a marked pick-up in profitability. I'm just trying to understand the dynamics between the two, there.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the business capability program, you've significantly increased the investment required behind the program to-date, both in terms of expense and capital spend, and not increased the expected returns on the project. When you first announced it, you did reassure us that you'd scoped this very closely and that 800 million was the all-in cost. I'm just wondering how much of the increase is actually delay in time scoping set out, and how much of it is actually increased scope. And if there is an element of increased scope, why are you willing to accept lower returns on the investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the facts you've pointed out are correct. Now that we've actually got into the program and looked at the complexity of the program, we believe that we should extend the timeline. And we have pushed the timeline out more as a risk management mitigant because as we get into the program, and we've gone live already with South African corporate, a lot of countries start coming live at the same time.</p>
          <p>And we believe that, just to make sure we have adequate resources to bring what is a very complex systems change across all of our countries, to bring that on with a number of them coming on at the same time would not be appropriate, so we've extended the timeline. And a lot of this cost is not what we've spent to-date; it's an increase in cost as we see going forward because of the extension of the timeline.</p>
          <p>The other point you mention, which is scope, is absolutely correct. We have increased the scope, and we've added on to the scope because we believe that it will be value-adding. That extra scope is something which will again go in over the course of the next year or two.</p>
          <p>We believe that, perhaps conservatively, that we should point out the additional costs which we can calculate now from those two issues, and I think prudently we have said, look, we are still very comfortable we'll deliver the 300. And as we go forward over the next year or two we'll reassess the benefits as we start to deliver them, but I think we're taking a prudent view at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to round up on this, it's a year since we first heard about the project; are you confident now that a 1.1 billion I think is the all-in, that'll be the cost now to you? There's no risk of further scope creep or project timeline extension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't say there wouldn't be more scope creep, because if someone said, look, we've got a really great addition here, then we would definitely look at it. But as we sit here today, we've done a lot of work now, and I think we're comfortable that the issues we may not have been actually at in some of the smaller countries, we now have a much better feel for. Because we've gone live, as I say, in South Africa already; we are well through the design of the front office, because we've gone live in the back office. So a lot of the issues which we perhaps only got into as we started design and build, we now have a much clearer understanding of.</p>
          <p>So I think the two things. We're trying to be conservative in our costs, and we're trying to be transparent in our presentation to the marketplace. And I think we're feeling a lot more comfortable that those are what the figures will be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you give us a split between the scope increase and the time extension increase? Are we talking two-thirds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scope is the -- I think, Chris, the scope would be the smaller part. You've seen that we've said about 40 million could be ForEx, and we've said could be, because we actually don't know which way the ForEx is going. And it may not be that at all, depending on currencies over the next three years.</p>
          <p>As far as scope is concerned, that is a smaller portion of the balance of the 160, which is more about the extension of the timeline, because we've now taken a 3.5 year to four-year program and taken it out by 12 months. And so it's the greater design and build and the timeline which is the majority of that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add a couple of things onto that; I'm sure what Malcolm says is absolutely right. There is a further point, which is that we did change the approach to the front-end design during the course of the year where that had been intended to be a different and separate design for Europe and LatAm, and ultimately South Africa.</p>
          <p>We have in fact now put those together as a single unified design. So we will ultimately wind up with a much bigger, more standardized approach -- well, a much more standardized approach around the world than we originally anticipated. And there will be, I think, substantial long-term strategic benefits from that, so that does constitute a change in the design philosophy.</p>
          <p>The second point I would make is that the benefits that we've pointed to, they've all been concentrated on hard numbers to do with procurement cost savings principally, and working capital benefits, and CapEx avoidance, and so on.</p>
          <p>There is, to my mind, a much greater benefit in the long-term strategic capability that these businesses give us -- that the systems give us, particularly in sales, marketing, and market information areas and those are not really costed into the benefit streams at all. And in fact, quite a lot of the advantage of this design change will pitch up in that area.</p>
          <p>So it's kind of like, as we say internally, when you make an M&amp;A acquisition, you can point with great clarity to the cost savings, the top line ambitions are not usually costed in. There's, by analogy, a fair amount of top line ambition in this system as well, not in the numbers.</p>

          <p>On the Asia question, yes, China had a very strong third calendar quarter, which will account for the difference between what you've read elsewhere and what we're reporting now. So, the story of the first half in China was the story of two quarters, so that explains that.</p>
          <p>And also, at the margin, the improved performance in our smaller Asian businesses, though they are small, that improvement does make a difference to their overall base because the overall profitability in Asia is itself quite small. So, the performance in India, Vietnam, Australia, et cetera also obviously contributed.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason DeRise from UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jason DeRise at UBS. I just wanted to talk about the balance sheet and your strong cash flow, and maybe just talk through how you're looking at using that going forward. And then secondly, I wanted to see, on the balance sheet, in terms of your working capital improvement, where you think working capital can be long term as a percent of sales on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, first of all, with the strong cash flow, yes, we are producing very good cash flows. At the moment, we're using that to pay down debt. Our debt is now down to below twice debt-to-EBITDA and is falling, and we would maintain that for the moment in time.</p>
          <p>I think as a major participant in the consolidation of the beer industry, we'd obviously look at all opportunities from time to time, and what this does is give us a lot of flexibility should a value-creating opportunity come along. But if that were not to be the case, for any reason, then obviously we would be looking at a future date as to the effectiveness and efficiency of our balance sheet and how we should be optimizing that. But certainly, at the moment, that's not on the radar screen. We are still business as usual; paying down debt and looking at how we can grow the business.</p>
          <p>As far as the net working capital side is concerned, it is very different market by market. Some markets require us to invest in our distributors and also to carry a certain amount of debtors, whereas other markets in fact allow us to operate purely on a cash flow basis. So, we don't have a strict percentage that we would guide to.</p>
          <p>But what we are doing as part of the business capability program is we are tightening up on all of our working capital, as you can see from the flows that are coming through, and we are outsourcing our back office into business process outsourcing areas. And they are incentivized to maintain the tightness around our working capital and to incrementally improve it, so we would expect to see that that is at least maintained, if not improved further, as we go forward over the next year or two. And that's part of the benefit that we would expect to come through from this program.</p>
          <p>And the point I perhaps didn't make talking earlier is that, aside from the operating benefits, as you can see, we've already hit all of our net working capital targets and are running ahead of them. And those targets were for 2012, and we're mid-2011 at the moment. So I think we'll get quite a few more benefits coming through from net working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to the net debt piece of the question, is there a level that you have in mind where you would have it as a minimum; you wouldn't want to go below that in terms of debt? Are we talking about you wouldn't let yourself go into a cash position? Or is it that you wouldn't want to be below 1 times? Is there anything you can share on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, there's no set figure. I think this is a dynamic situation. If we got down -- if it kept on falling and we could see that looking ahead in our strategic planning that we didn't see a use for that cash over a medium-term period and we were likely to continue to just decrease and run into a cash position, we would obviously, and the Board would be taking a very strong view as to what we should be doing with our cash then.</p>
          <p>So I don't want to point to an absolute figure because it does also take into account what plans we may have, whether they be organic expansion or M&amp;A expansion, and that would be on the table at the time that we take the decision.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning gentlemen, just a simple question looking into African business and comparing at your partner Castel on a forward-looking basis, what do you think is a sustainable targets for margin, do you think mid-20s like your partners or do you think structurally there are reasons in the business that would prevent that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julian, I don't know of any structural reasons that would prevent that. We have been expanding that business pretty rapidly, as you know, and there's a variety of start-up costs, new CapEx, under utilization and stuff in it. But if I look at the profile of the Castel business versus ours, I don't see any particular reason why there should be a structural long-term difference.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Graham, your view on Nigeria. I know you've got a toehold in Nigeria, but it still remains a very attractive and profitable market for your competitors; is that somewhere that you're still focused on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say focused on it; we certainly have our eye on it. And we've acknowledged for a long time that it is a big market. It probably has more potential than has ever been realized and it would be nice to be there in a bigger way, and we still think that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may, just a final question, maybe for Malcolm. Malcolm, just on a technical basis, the increase in excise in Africa of 10%, when adjusted for both volume and currency, it looks quite light relative to the excise hike in Botswana and elsewhere, is that a function of the reduction in Zambia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have obviously a weighted average right across Africa, so it's very difficult to read that in. But there is a reduction in Zambia. The increase in Botswana, bearing in mind that when you look at the revenue now and volumes in Botswana they are a lot less than they used to be. So the impact of Botswana on the African business is a lot smaller than it was. And so whilst we've had excise increases in other areas, the rate is not increasing as much as you would think if Botswana was a bigger portion of Africa.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Botswana's always been quite a small business, Julian. It was disproportionately profitable. But in revenue terms, it's relatively small.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everybody. Two things. First of all, just coming back to the minority charge, for the second half and moving on from there, are there going to be any other strange factors, any other ongoing development losses and businesses? Or would it be reasonable now to expect that charge to grow in line with the profits of the regions where you have those minorities?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, coming on to the Black Economic Empowerment charge, are there going to be future exceptional charges, ongoing exceptional charges related to that business? Can you remind us what the annual cash impact would be in terms of dividends going out to the new shareholders in that unit? And are you still estimating that the overall economic cost to SAB once all this is done will be about 6 billion rand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Jonathan, just on the minority charge, going forward into the second half, obviously we would be seeking to turn around the business that incurred the losses. So, if anything, if we can do that, then we would remove that negative in the minority charge and it would go back up again.</p>
          <p>But the other side of the coin is that we would be getting greater EBITA in our EBITA line. So we would expect the minority charge to actually get back up to where you perhaps thought it would have been and to grow from there, and so this is just something where we've had to -- we've had a loss and it's been taken through into the first half of the year. But if we get rid of that loss, then obviously the charge goes back up to normal, and then from there it should increase in line with profits throughout the Group. And it's mainly Angola, and a very small amount in Latin America.</p>
          <p>As far as the BEE is concerned, there will be future exceptional charges. You might recall, when the Annual General Meeting was held last year, we said that we expected just over $200 million in IFRS non-cash charges, and I think that's probably increased slightly because of the rand exchange rate against the dollar. So we would expect over a period of about four years a total of somewhere around about 210 to 225 depending upon exchange rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's comparable to the 126 million that you took --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>126 million has got some upfront for the retail, which goes in 100%, and then the employees go in over a period of four years. So we have some for the employees in the first year and there's another three-year trail for them to come through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think your other part to the question, the economic cost, yes, we did say that we expected that to be less than 1% of the SABMiller market capitalization. And that again depends upon the performance of SAB, because in the end the shares will be exchanged into SABMiller shares on a relative basis of performance of SAB against the performance of SABMiller. So it does depend upon a lot of variables as we keep moving another six, seven, eight years down the line.</p>
          <p>And the cash impact of dividends, well, we're at a fairly early stage. We've just paid our first dividend of 32 million rand, and that's in the first half of the year. It depends upon the performance of SAB. And, of course, SAB has the lower portion of their profits in the first half of the year, with the majority coming over the summer peak period in the second six months. So we would expect that to be more than it has been in the first six months when we pay the dividend in the second six months, but it really just depends upon the performance of the company going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, two questions. Now you've done the further work on the business capability program, are you able to split down the 300 million benefit for us in terms of function, i.e., procurement and other areas, and also give us a final split by geography of where that'll come through?</p>
          <p>And the second question was around U.S. pricing, where some of the comments from Graham earlier on sound a bit more upbeat than we've had historically. Also we've had some scanner data that seems to suggest recently that some of that pricing has been given back; I wonder if you could just comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the business capability program one first. We haven't split the benefits out. And I think looking at that, what we haven't tried to do is split it exactly by way of function, although the procurement function takes most of it. So the majority of the benefits will come from the procurement function, both in the function itself and in the benefits that are retained by each of the countries, so that is spread into geography.</p>
          <p>The balance of it comes from a number of areas, including the actual business process outsourcing; it comes from the actual benefit we get from not having to do our own transaction processing and the saving of costs in-country.</p>
          <p>Just using the global template and the standardization will give us benefits in overhead savings in the four areas we mentioned, which &#x2013; or the three areas outside procurement, which is IT and HR and in finance. So those are the major areas, but the significant benefits come through procurement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then by geography, I think you had indicated about 120 million probably in Europe; is that still the right sort of figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe will give us some benefits additional to those I've mentioned because we do have a regional manufacturing project running in Europe, and so, yes, they should be on track for that type of figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in LatAm about the same figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, LatAm doesn't have the benefit of &#x2013; or at this stage doesn't have the benefit of regional manufacturing. But, Ian, we haven't broken that down and given that as a &#x2013; by geography in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in general, LatAm is not as fragmented a region as Europe. Remember, that Europe has a lot more small countries and small management centers, so there's a bit more scope for optimization there.</p>
          <p>On the U.S., I'm not aware that I was trying to be any more upbeat. The outlook on the U.S. is pretty much steady as she goes. It's a continuation of what has been happening, as far as I'm concerned. There's a little bit of peel-back of the latest increase, but nothing out of the ordinary again so I don't think there's anything particularly newsworthy happening there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Concerning Latin America, and in particular Colombia, we see Peru and Ecuador moving ahead. Concerning the dynamics of Colombia going forward, including all the new &#x2013; the innovations that you have, how do you see this volume growth developing in Colombia, going forward?</p>
          <p>And also, the fixed cost reduction, which was quite substantial, how do you see that moving forward into second half and 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we reported, the volumes in Colombia have been reasonably sharply down and offset by the other ones. Now that was a significant reversal from the trend up until the time that that tax increase was applied. So we hope and believe that the effects of that tax increase will gradually continue to be washed out.</p>
          <p>It is, unfortunately, of course an ad valorem tax, so it's not something that goes away in the sense that it gets washed out by inflation because there's now just a permanently higher tax on beer than there was. But nevertheless, we think that the market momentum should recover. It probably won't have completely recovered during this year, but certainly as we go into fiscal '12 I would hope that that would be the case.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the volume, the initiatives that we've undertaken, yes, we've done quite a lot of &#x2013; we've taken some extra steps there, introduced new brands, as you say, and there's a lot of stuff happening both in retail execution and in brand support. But the problem is that beer has become less affordable compared to aguardiente, and the market is showing the effects of that.</p>
          <p>So in a sense, at the moment we're having to pedal harder to stand still. Nevertheless, I think that that market &#x2013; we believe strongly that that market has considerable growth potential from its current level, and after the setback we'll resume that growth.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the downturn is less severe now on a day-to-day basis than it was. But I can't give you any real data points --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fixed costs, yes, we haven't implemented the full fixed cost program in Colombia. As we've announced, we closed the Bogota brewery; we are reassigning production. The business becomes more efficient all the time. It would certainly help to have operating leverage on our side again, rather than operating against us. And I think when volumes come back you can expect the fixed cost improvement to start dropping to the bottom line better.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Malcolm; hello, Graham. Thanks for taking my question. I've got three questions, if I may. The first is just, Malcolm, is it possible to give us a little bit more insight into the FX impact on the input costs, and maybe you could say what portion of your costs in South Africa, Colombia, maybe Europe, is in hard currency and benefiting from this? And what portion of &#x2013; what have you assumed for the second half outlook in terms of FX impact? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is just on could you give us a little bit of details, Graham, on the nature of the fixed cost savings in Latin America and Europe?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, you don't speak a lot about Miller International, but I see that business turned around significantly; I think it's from a loss of 3 million last year to a profit of 17 million because the North American division beat market expectations. Maybe you can give us some insight into how that business works and what drove that turnaround. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Nico, just on ForEx, we don't have that detail; we don't give out that detail. You're looking now at a very detailed level in each of our countries. I think what I would say to you is that you can see that we benefited from ForEx in places like LatAm, South Africa, not really in Africa because our currencies went up, but in those two areas we did get quite significant benefits on our raw material input costs.</p>
          <p>In the second half, we have already hedged some &#x2013; and again this is hedged on a monthly basis. So we have different levels of hedging for different currencies, some in euros, some in dollars, and so on, and each of the countries are hedged at different levels as well going through. So with the ForEx levels, we've got a certain amount which is locked-off in actual committed hedge and currency and others where we've actually left it open. And we've actually been &#x2013; we're received some good results from that, as you've seen, because of the strengthening of the currencies.</p>
          <p>So there is a margin within our risk management guard rails within which each of the countries are allowed to trade, and we don't try and prescribe to them exactly what they have to do. So, on a month-by-month basis, we can see what's happening as long as they are performing and maintaining their covers to the minimum that we require and not outside the maximums that we require.</p>
          <p>So, I would say we're probably conservatively positioned in ForEx gain for the next six months.</p>

          <p>Malcolm, maybe a follow-up to that. Previously, you indicated that about 80% of South Africa's COGS are dollar-denominated; is it still running at that level?</p>
          <p>And maybe you could highlight what is the size of the transactional benefit that we're speaking here, or you could break the mid single-digit decline in raw materials. Is it &#x2013; how much of that is FX, just to get a sense of modeling that going forward, if we take our own view on currency obviously.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Nico, I missed your second half. But basically, in South Africa, I think what we said was that up to 80% is either affected &#x2013; or actually dollar or affected by the dollar because it's import price parity. So, a lot of the goods that we get in South Africa now can be imported and as a result of that the local suppliers have pushed their prices up, and I think if you were at the South African presentation, or the beer division presentation, you would have heard Norman taking you through all of those issues. So, nothing has really changed as far as that is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I just handle that North American washing machine point of yours? You're asking about the difference between the North American segment and the Miller segment; let me just ask Malcolm to cover that, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you asked about Miller International. Now, there are three things in our North American segment; one is MillerCoors, which is I think quite clear; the other one is Miller Brewing International, which did do very well; and then there is a section which is basically the corporate or the structural costs of holding Miller Brewing International, plus our investment in the partnership arrangement, and then it's MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>Now, that's areas, a bit like a corporate center; sometime gets some costs, sometimes picks up some credits. So, from one period to the other, you may have a couple of million credit in one and a million &#x2013; in the next one you may have some millions in costs. So you do get a little bit of a swing outside of the MillerCoors' ongoing large segment, which you can monitor a lot better.</p>
          <p>The other one is a bit like our corporate costs, where sometimes you have a few more million and sometimes you have some less, and you don't get an accurate trend by just looking at it from one half to the other. This year we obviously benefited, as against last year where we had some costs, and that gave us an increase in the growth rate, together with good performance from Miller Brewing International.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What should we assume for the first half 17 million positive benefit for Miller International corporate costs for the full year? Should it continue running at that rate in the second half and going forward? Or could it be anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because these costs come at the time of &#x2013; we don't plan for them, and they are sometimes costs that come through before or just after the year end, it's difficult to give you a trend line. But I would say that what we saw in the first half would probably be more favorable than we would expect for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the second half is likely to be negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the second half is not likely to show the same favorable benefits that we got in the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, Nico, on your question on fixed costs, it's quite difficult to give you a blow-by-blow account of that because actually, I mean, most fixed cost savings over time are sort of a game of a thousand cuts; it's a little bit of rationalization, bit of organization, and so on. There are big chunks in both the regions you mentioned though which are production rationalizations. You did mention the closure of the Bogota brewery; that obviously has a big effect and rationalization from that.</p>
          <p>Also, in much of Latin America, and in particular in Colombia, distribution is a very large expense because it's a highly fragmented retail base, so efficiencies in distribution come from just working away at them over time. They've also managed to achieve quite a lot of efficiency in customer interaction in the way they deal with customers.</p>
          <p>Europe, more of the same. If you look back over the last few years, we've closed a number of breweries in Europe and obviously that saves costs. Another big thing in Europe has been the functionalization of manufacturing and we are driving benefits from that, and I think there's more to come as you heard from Malcolm and in the presentation.</p>
          <p>We've also rationalized and grouped the management of small countries in Europe, what Alan calls the challenger markets, and that has enabled a very fine focus on profits and on sharing of costs. And, in fact, the small countries in Europe performed very well in a profit sense, so way ahead of volume performance recently, so that's been a contributor. So, it's been rationalization; specialization; and some production downsizing.</p>
