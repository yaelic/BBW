          <p>Good morning everybody. A warm welcome to all investors and analysts.  You have dialed into the Earnings Conference Call with SingTel Management in respect of SingTel's Financial Results for the Quarter and Year Ended 31st, March, 2008.</p>
          <p>My name is Yang Fong and let me introduce panel members on the call.  Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Francis Heng, Group CFO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Lim Chuan Poh, CEO International; and joining us from Sydney, Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO, Optus. Of course, assisting them will also be other representatives from the senior management team.</p>
          <p>Before we start rolling in the questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results. Over to you, Sock Koong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Yang Fong, I am delighted to report that our results for the financial year ended 31st March, 2008, was very strong. We showed strong revenue and earnings growth and if I can just, you know, give you a few highlights.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the group were up 11% and that's bolstered by double-digit growth that we have in Singapore and we also benefited from the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Underlying earnings per share was up 17% to 23 cents and just a bit of details, in Singapore the revenue growth was 11% that's driven by solid growth in both the telco and IT businesses.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was up 3% to almost S$2 billion; and in Australia, revenues were up 4% and that's a very strong performance considering that we had declined mobile termination rates and we also exit from consumer fixed line resale.</p>
          <p>Optus was able to maintain its profitability. We had operational EBITDA of A$2 billion. At the associates' level, we now have 185 million mobile customers in the group and the associates' earnings continue to grow at a very impressive pace. We have a 29% growth in earnings before tax and exceptionals.</p>
          <p>And last comment on the dividend. The Board is recommending a final ordinary dividend of 6.9 cents and together with the interim dividend of 5.6 cents per share that was earlier paid, that will bring total ordinary dividend to 12.5 cents per share representing 54% payout ratio. So, maybe with that we can move to Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good set of numbers. I have actually three questions. The first is on associates. You have guided for a double digit growth for associates, so I just wanted to get a color on besides Bharti or which other associates do you expect to grow double digit or is it just Bharti pulling the whole associates? Second question is on the tax rate, could you give some color of what kind of tax rate you should be using for this year, given that you are saying it could be raised slightly? And, third question is on your medium-term growth rate of double-digit growth. Do you think in the short-term which is like the next one to two years we should still expect double-digit growth in earnings? Yes, these three questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Please stay on the line as the call has been disconnected. One moment please. Thank you. We are back now, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I repeat my questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Mr. Sachin, don't worry; we have fat fingers some of us. That's me actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we're now going to answer your questions. My apologies &#x2013; wrong button pressed. Okay, on your questions you asked whether the &#x2013; which were the associates that had guided on revenue growth. To just highlight that, other than Telkomsel that's not listed, Bharti, AIS and Globe are listed and they have actually provided separate guidance for the operations for the year. And in fact, when we provide a guidance it's really for our, the associates line as a whole and not on the individual company. But, just to comment on a number of associates that actually provided top line guidance. Telkomsel has guided the revenue growth of more than 15%, Globe has said that their top line will grow at a slower rate than 2007, and in the case of AIS they have guided 5 to 7% revenue growth. Okay? On our medium-term earnings guidance of double digits, that's not meant to be on the year-to-year basis. We would really be looking at it over a period of time and to see, and it's our target and aspiration to try to grow earnings double digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Medium-term is like five years, seven years, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That kind of timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the tax rate question I'll pass over to Francis to take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. To answer &#x2013; your question was whether can we give you a formula. We can't give you a standard formula to forecast our effective tax rate, as the Group's tax expense comprises many variable components and is a consolidation of the tax expense of the entities within the Group each of which provide for tax in accordance with the regulations and rates prevailing in their respective jurisdictions. However, you'll note that in our Group's guidance in our MD&amp;A for FY '08-'09 we have pointed out that effective tax rate for the Group is expected to increase due to a higher proportion of earnings from the regional mobile associates which operate in countries with higher tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I asked this question because Bharti has a lower tax rate and they are growing the fastest at this point of time. So, is it necessary that actually effective tax rate will go high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is also the relative proportion of earnings, you know, just to &#x2013; a relative proportion of earnings. So you can see that the associates are actually growing at a faster rate than Singapore or Australia and that will be become increasingly a larger part of our earnings. And this associates effective tax rate is actually higher than the Singapore effective tax rate of 18, 19%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I suppose to do your modeling you probably would have to do it bottoms up, from the individual associates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe yes, that's right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Next we have Mr. Anand Ramachandran from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning. Thank you so much for the call and congratulations on some very good numbers. I had one question on Singapore and then a bunch of questions on acquisitions. Singapore, does the margin or CapEx guidance incorporate anything on the NetCo or OpCo efforts in the NGN initiative? In either case could you provide us with some flavor on how we should look at this either on a 12-month view or on a 36-month view, generally from, I guess, an anticipation into earnings and cash flow perspective? Secondly on MTN, clearly Bharti is in talks and I understand you might not be able to talk appropriately enough given the sensitivity of the transaction, but I just wanted some broad thoughts around firstly, does SingTel see itself as a shareholder of Bharti in the transaction or an independent bidder with Bharti, or a combination of both? What are the criteria you'd be looking at into this transaction? And lastly, if you could just reaffirm your gearing targets for us that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anand, this is Allen here. I'll answer your first question regarding the CapEx for the Singapore business. The CapEx guidance for the Singapore business takes into consideration two major capital investments that we have to make. The first one is in mobile. As you can see from the large uptake of customers that we've had this year, we're going to have to upgrade the capacity there. Also, I think we need to upgrade the capacity of our mobile network to take on higher speeds and greater data downloads because we are seeing some trends in terms of personal broadband usage. In terms of the fixed network, we also see that our customers are ready for some ultra high-speed applications for some faster upload as well. So we've taken into consideration the upgrading of our existing copper last month to take &#x2013; to meet the requirements of these customers. We have obviously put in a bid together with OpenNet for the NetCo part of it. But our capital investment does take into consideration that we will be upgrading this network at some point in the financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so some NGN CapEx is included in that CapEx guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some assumption about upgrading. Obviously we have put in a bid and we are reasonably well-positioned to win that. But our CapEx forecast, that's taking into consideration the upgrade of part of our network for this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anand this is Chuan Poh here. On your second question relating to MTN Bharti, as you know at this stage the discussion is very exploratory and very preliminary. So we are not able to offer you the answers to your question regarding whether it is going to be a direct or indirect investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anand, did you also have a question on gearing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean could you reaffirm your gearing targets? And I guess my question was, is there any thought on whether Bharti would be the acquirer or SingTel would want to go with Bharti at this point in time or is that still too early a stage to even think or talk about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all of the options are being explored, and at this stage in time there is nothing that is confirmed. And so we couldn't really offer you an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the gearing targets? I mean it's still 1.7 to 2 times net debt to EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not have official guidance on specific targets. The EBITDA interest expense targets that we mentioned in the past were associated with a specific bond issuance many years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not formally set official targets and provide a specific guidance to investors or analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just hoping to get from your perspective; given SingTel's balance sheet, what do you think is a broad range that SingTel would be reasonably comfortable with in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are committed to investment grade credit ratings, and I think you understand within that commitment there will be a range of financials that we would have to operate within and certainly that's part of our overall capital management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, sir. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Rama from Macquarie Singapore. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I have two questions. Firstly, with regards to the Singapore business and reflecting the margin guidance that you have for the current year at 40%, which essentially is flat year-on-year, I'm just wondering if you were to talk about your revenue guidance of mid-single digit and your margin guidance of 40%, on a relative basis, what are you more comfortable with? And the reason I ask you that is given that the competitive intensity is something that is out of your control, so I'm just wondering to what extent have you baked in competitive pressures into your margin guidance? That will be the first question. Second one is with regards to your revenue guidance for Singapore business, on a relative basis, what do you think would be the driver of mid-single digit growth? Is it going to be mobile or data or some other operating line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen will take the question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to start with regards to your first question; I think we always deliberate very carefully before we issue any guidance. So I think we are comfortable in the guidance that we are giving for both the revenue as well as the EBITDA number. And I think at the end of the day, competitive pressures will come and go.</p>
          <p>I think SingTel will respond across a lot of different dimensions. I think you need to assume that SingTel does not just use price. We also have other competitive dimensions based on the quality of our network, our brand positioning in the market. So I think we will cope with this competitive pressure by using different levers. But what's good is that we will ensure that we'll continue to lead in this market.</p>
          <p>I think your second question as to what are the main products, perhaps that's driving our revenue guidance. It continues to remain mobile, which is a very strong growth driver for us; as well as data and Internet, which reflects our strong position in the business and in the consumer market for those products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I can just follow up on the mobile part of it just, sorry, one last question there, is on the post paid ARPU which has come down on a sequential quarter basis. In terms of the trends for this year, do you actually see this is a level that is sustainable, the $88 ARPU that you have or do you think there is some variance around this in terms of upside or downside to the ARPU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; we don't forecast what's going to happen to our ARPU. I can answer the first part of your question. The difference &#x2013; the reason why the ARPU has declined compared on the sequential quarter basis is primarily because of the seasonal impact of roaming that was in Q3 that is missing in Q4. Obviously, Q3 because of the holiday season, a lot more of our mobile customers are outside Singapore, so I think roaming revenue has declined a little bit in Q4 compared to Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, we have Mr. Colin McCallum from Credit Suisse in Thailand. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions from me. First of all, just on the domestic results. EBITDA from Singapore has declined now for two consecutive quarters. I know you don't actually split out cellular versus fixed line EBITDA, but can you just give us some rough guidance as to where the declines are coming from? Is it because you're being a little bit more aggressive particularly on the cellular side? Or is it because you are trying to be a bit more aggressive with mio and your bundled packages? That's kind of the first part of the question. And then secondly, should we expect the trends to be that the EBITDA might continue to be weak for the next quarter or two, as MNP is introduced? But then, would you expect that to recover, hence giving your flat guidance? Just looking for your guidance overall in terms of trends there. Perhaps if you could answer that question then maybe I can come back with a larger kind of strategic question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, let me answer your question on the EBITDA margin decline. The decline in Q4 was primarily because of a couple of things. Number one is primarily because our record number of mobile customers that we connected. And number two was that there was some response, especially in the mobile area to competitive pressures in the market especially in anticipation of MNP coming in June.</p>
          <p>The second question with regard to what's going to happen in the next quarter. I think &#x2013; we don't give guidance on that perspective. What we are speaking to is our guidance of 40% EBITDA margin for the year for the Singapore business overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough, thank you. And next really a sort of broader question on acquisition for Sock Koon. If a company is operating in a different region but doesn't need significant management help, is a well managed company in itself and it doesn't need capital, then what sort of synergies would SingTel believe that it can apply in order to justify a premium to be paid for that sort of business relative to the way the stock market is currently valuing it? That's the first kind of theoretical strategic question. I guess the second question is, if the answer to the previous question is that there aren't significant and very easy to pick up synergy benefits, then is management basically assuring shareholders that they will walk away from such a transaction if it's not evidently going to be value creating? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Chuan Poh talk a bit more about the kind of synergies that we have been able to derive from our associates. But I'd just emphasize that we have always been financially disciplined. We have looked at each of the investment opportunities that are presented to us. We look at the specific investments and associated risks and ascertain if the rewards from it justified the risk and the purchase consideration that is appropriate.</p>
          <p>Clearly without feel that certain amount of synergies that can be derived and as part of the negotiations of any transaction, we would have to decide what part of the synergy is &#x2013; how the synergies benefit is going to be shared amongst the parties. So maybe I can pass it to Chuan Poh to talk more specifically about the kind of synergy benefit that we get from amongst associates in SingTel in Australia, SingTel in Singapore and Optus Australian operations as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Essentially if we look at the entire spectrum of SingTel's portfolio in terms of our asset overseas including Australia you will find that the market maturity is of varying degrees. And within that itself, therefore, it brings about a lot of lessons, both forward and backward looking lessons that we can learn. And that has in fact helped us in terms of how we have been able to introduce certain strategy initiatives in each of the associates to cope with the kind of impending situation that some of our other associates have gone through before them. That is one area that we had been able to gain some synergies.</p>
          <p>Other areas would be more physical including pricing, as you know, we do a lot of procurement benchmarking and in some cases, even joint procurement as in the case of SIM cards and this has helped in terms of collecting all our requirement in our negotiation with vendors. Other things beyond that would be things like product and services that we help to develop and help to exchange between one another. If you would recall some years back, when Philippines was the first to introduce things like electronic pop-ups for their prepaid cards. This was quickly transferred over to Bharti in a very short implementation timeframe and has resulted in Bharti's growth as well. So also the kind of things of local expertise has been able to be shared around the associate that can help them to also bring about more effective sales and marketing efforts. But beyond that, we are also now looking at more regional level products and services that allow the inter parties to actually get some benefit out of being part of the group.</p>
          <p>And as you know the telco business is also undergoing transformation, going forward, it is no longer just about the core telecom services. We have to go into other areas, both upstream and downstream of the core businesses. And many of these businesses require critical mass and scale on a regional basis in order to be successful. So all these are the kind of things that actually are value adding, so even though those cases you mentioned where there is no CapEx requirement, no management requirement, there is actually a lot of synergies that are in between the associate and JVs. I hope that answers your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for your comments. I guess, what would be of key interest to us is if you guys could actually quantify any of these things in terms of higher returns or higher margins or higher return on capital, lower CapEx. It's the quantification, I think that people find tricky. But obviously, I don't expect you to be able do that on the spot just now. Thanks for your comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had two questions. One is on staff numbers. In both Singapore and Australia, you've increased staffing significantly though in Australia, for example, there is 10,700 staff up from 9,900 last year, same with Singapore. I was just wondering what's driving this growth and with staff growth now exceeding revenue growth, what could be done in the future to reverse this trend? My second question is Australia-specific, if you look at Consumer &amp; SMB, the ARPUs have been stable. Is it fair to expect that Fusion product has not resulted in ARPU compression?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you answer that Sock Koong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think if you look at -- maybe I will just comment briefly on overall staff cost increase. And then Paul can talk a bit more about the situation particularly in Australia. If you look at Singapore, we have delivered double-digit revenue growth in all the Singapore businesses and the head count increase in IT and the telco business is about 8.6%, so the head count increase is below revenue increase. I think particularly in the IT area which is a very people-intensive business, the revenue growth there has been very strong and in line with that, we've seen the head count numbers increase in the IT business. In Australia, the head count increase is about 8%, maybe I will let Paul talk about where the increases are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sock Koong. If you look at the growth in the Australian numbers, it's principally coming from three main areas. First of all in our Consumer business, where we've added heads, and that reflects the growing penetration of more complex broadband products and also did coincide with our implementation of our project-wide platforms which are new billing platforms, a new bill format. Both of those have driven increased and longer calls into our call centers so we've increased headcounts in the Consumer division to reflect that. Part of our strategy moving forward though will be to try and find ways of automating some of that traffic or indeed of taking down the volumes we have got to handle with a manual interaction.</p>
          <p>The second big area of growth is in our Optus Business area where a lot of the heads have been added through our Alphawest subsidiary, who provide managed services to the business market and that very much tracks in line with our growth in that segment which as you can see from the Optus Business results, has been fairly significant.</p>
          <p>The third big area, Deutsche, we have had growth in is in Virgin and that again is a fully owned subsidiary of Optus, again reflects the launch we made of what we call internally the cashew product. That is wireless broadband as a substitute for fixed broadband. Our product uses a 3G network to provide DSL type equivalent broadband and a home phone with a dial tone but all running off the wireless network and that also meant a requirement for staffing up with heads inside the Virgin business for a different type of call than we would have got off the traditional mobile network.</p>
          <p>That's really the primary drivers of growth in our business and certainly as you can see from our EBITDA performance overall, today is the first time since 2005 that we've put in an increase in our absolute EBITDA and also very much in contrast to the rest of the industry in Australia. We have managed to maintain our margins reasonably consistently over the last couple of years. So I think, you can see there is a very strong focus on managing margin and managing EBITDA in the Australian business.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Sameer, we've got one more question you asked us about ARPUs in broadband and telephony in the Consumer and SMB area. Warren Hardy, who is the managing director of Consumer in Optus is here, and so given that he drives most of the volume on broadband and telephony in the Consumer and SMB space, I'll get him to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. I think the question was that the ARPUs -- on net ARPUs looked relatively stable, I think that was the question at the beginning. And I assume that infers that maybe there was a concern that packages such as Fusion would drive further ARPU dilution than what you're actually seeing in the numbers. And I think it's important to understand that although the Fusion package is great value to the customers versus what they may pay for a similar suite of services from the incumbent, these tariffs are structured in such a fashion that they do have for example, a certain amount of data inclusions included in them. But what we're finding is customers use broadband products more and more, then more and more customers actually end up using more than their data inclusion for the packages and then pay for some excess usage past that point. And obviously that acts as a positive driver to ARPU on the base. So I think that the increased usage by customers of broadband products and the extent to which they use all their inclusion and then start paying for excess usage in excess of that acts as a mitigating factor to that and actually maintains the ARPU profile that you have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mark McDonnell from BBY in Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have three questions. The first concerns the incremental mobile network investment in Australia that was recently announced, where as I understood it, a total CapEx of about 315 million is being committed to secure an extension of the network to reach an additional 2% of the population. I am just wondering what the investment rationale is here. On my assessment even with 50% market share in that incremental market, at current ARPUs and margins, the return on assets is at best only around 4%. So, my question there is what is the commercial rationale for that investment?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to Indonesia, and in particular, I am wondering what comments you can make beyond the press statement of the other day about the District Court upholding the KPPU's decision. It would seem the implications are operationally that that Telkomsel's future earnings, it's going to have significant downward pressure given the requirement for Telkomsel to reduce prices by 15%. And from an investment perspective, for SingTel, there is effectively a direction around a two-year window in which to divest. So what's the plan for SingTel in that context?</p>
          <p>And the last question relates to potential new investments in the region and I am interested particularly given the recent proclamation in Vietnam of Decree 109, and its doi moi program, would SingTel regard Vietnamese carriers such as UniPhone and MobiFone as prospectively attractive investments? And more particularly, does your investment strategy require you to be the only significant strategic foreign shareholder, or would you welcome investment from other regional carriers in a context like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the question on the mobile expansion from 96 to 98% coverage, maybe Paul you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I will, thanks Sock Koong and Mark, thanks for the question. In fact I was listening with interest to your very useful comments just a short while ago on CNBC. In terms of the mobile network, it's really complete investment we were making in 3G. What you've seen us do is over the last six to nine months highlight the focus we put on mobile and our renewed focus on driving increased momentum there. So we announced the rollout of HSPA and 3G across our full footprint and we talked about an expenditure there about 500 million, in fact that's well on track. We expect to have about 80% of the population covered with that network by the end of June and we are on track for getting to 96% of the footprint with HSPA and 3G by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And then we've announced the investment just in the last week of a further 315 million to roll out into that extra 2% of the population. When we look at that it's not just about the regional markets, although obviously they will generate some opportunity as you quite correctly pointed out Telstra has a market share in regional areas which is often 10 to 15 percentage points higher than their national average share. So clearly there is some opportunity there. I should add that when we look at that opportunity we look at it not just in a mobile sense but through our being able to use our mobile network as a fixed line substitute both in terms of wireless broadband but also in telephony with products like the one we launched recently on Virgin.</p>
          <p>But the other important attributes that we get from this investment is the fact that now we are the only player other than Telstra with significant geographical reach and coverage and that has a halo effect back in the metro markets where particularly customers who are high ARPU and who tend to use their mobile a lot, have shown to be coverage sensitive and also a lot of businesses especially businesses with need to be able to deliver or operate outside the metro cities also rank coverage as an important feature. So we also factor in some of the market share gains we believe we can make in metro areas as a byproduct of the investment. Hopefully I have helped you in terms of our overall rationale between that, the announcement on iPhone and the strong focus you're hearing from us inside the company in driving our mobile business you can see that there's a clear commitment to driving mobile over the next 12 months.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, just if I could clarify one thing you said there &#x2013; you said 96% coverage for HSPA by the end of this year. Did you mean December or March '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good point, Mark. I meant December. Thanks very much for clarifying.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. KPPU, I think the Central Jakarta District Court's decision was obviously very disappointing for us. We think that there is absolutely no basis for the court's ruling. But Mark, just to clarify a comment that you make, the District Court actually commented that the KPPU has no authority to fix telecom tariffs and therefore the earlier KPPU ruling about Telkomsel having to drop tariffs by 15% was actually canceled upon the District Court's comment that KPPU has no authority to fix telecom tariffs in Indonesia. I think, you know just our position on this issue is very clear. SingTel mobile owns 35% of Telkomsel and our partner there PT Telkom owns the balance 65% and consistent with the majority position that Telkom has in Telkomsel, they control all the various governance bodies, they have a majority on the Board of Commissioners, they have a majority on the Board of Directors and they have a majority on all the board committees as well. So clearly we don't control Telkomsel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Notwithstanding that do you feel that you are being required to divest your stake in Telkomsel, subject to that District Court's decision?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know we are looking of course at the judgment in detail and we will definitely examine all ways to protect our position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">

          <p>Mark, you have a previous question on Decree 109. What specifically was the comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What I was asking there, obviously there is an opportunity here for SingTel with carriers like Vinaphone and Mobiphone and SingTel continuing in its quest for a regional footprint in mobile carriers. But particularly, given the nature of this program and the more shall we say open nature of the invitation for foreign direct investment, would SingTel take part in this program, assuming that it was attractive, only on the basis that you were the sole strategic foreign shareholder? Or would you contemplate a scenario where you might be co-investing with other regional carriers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>I think it's premature to make our position so clear since the equitization process hasn't really been finalized in any way.

          <p>Hi. I have some questions regarding your 3G networks both in Singapore and in Australia. If you could give me an idea about the ARPUs of your 3G customers versus your regular customers in both territories that would be helpful, also the percentage of non-voice revenues for this type of 3G subscribers? And finally, if you could give us an idea about the number of HSDPA subscribers, I think probably only in Singapore? And then, one other question with not related to 3G is &#x2013; well perhaps related to 3G is on iPhone, if for either region when we might see iPhone coming to those markets? And do you think there would be 3G versions of the iPhone and the timing thereof? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Allen here &#x2013; I'll try and answer on behalf of Paul as well, but, Paul please jump in. I think, in terms of the ARPU of 3G customers and what ARPUs from voice et cetera, I'm afraid we don't disclose that for either Singapore or Australia, as I understand it. We also don't give a split between what percentage of our 3G customers are on HSDPA. So I'm sorry I can't give you the details. With regard to iPhone, as it pertains to the four countries where we have reached agreement with Apple. I think all we are able to say right now is that Apple will work with the four operators in these countries to bring in iPhone sometime this year. We obviously have a partnership with Apple and we need to respect their disclosure wishes, so I think we can't give you any more light other than what we have disclosed to the press, I'm afraid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Allen, it's Paul here, and g'day Paul. Just very briefly, the one thing we do disclose is on page 42, of the MBNA we do show the number of 3G subscribers in Australia increased to 1.4 million, which is about a 20% increase compared to the previous quarter and up substantially on last year. And the big issue in the Australia market really is the arrival of an affordable device that could go on prepaid for 3G. So really currently most of the focus of 3G devices is in the postpaid market and we're at the early stages of affordable 3G devices for prepaid. That's the thing that will give a big acceleration in prepaid penetration -sorry in 3G penetration over the next year. Otherwise I would echo all of Allen's comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If perhaps, if you can give an idea then what is the average ASP for 3G phones and what is the lowest price now and where you do think to go in a year's time then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll talk mainly on Australia first and then Allen might want to come in on Singapore, but I'll show that to Warren Hardy, who runs Consumer, because Warren really drives most of the prepaid activity and probably best placed to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the question is what is the average price of the 3G handset today and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's important to understand, to pick up on Paul's comments about, particularly 3G penetration into the prepaid base, is the really sweet spot for handsets in the prepaid market in Australia is when you are in the price range of around about a AU$100. Now there aren't any 3G handsets today that are in that range they're more up in the high 200 &#x2013; sorry, $300 range today, but we would expect over the coming year that 3G devices will start to move down to a price point which will make them attractive and start hovering in the sweet spot of demand in the prepaid market. So, as I echo Paul's comments, that in the 12 months, you'll start to see 3G moving to a price point which is very attractive for prepaid customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Warren. And then Paul, just to close on that, we've found in this market, if you subsidize prepaid heavily you get a huge amount of unbundling and grey shipments offshore. So for that reason, none of the carriers here has really been prepared to aggressively subsidize prepaid in recent years. Allen, did you want to comment on Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regard to Singapore, actually we have 3G phones available across all our price plans and even at the lowest price plan, we do have $0 3G phone, if you are in the postpaid market, because the prepaid dynamics in Singapore is very different from Australia. Prepaid in Singapore is primarily used by foreign workers. We do not subsidize prepaid on 3G and we are &#x2013; our prepaid service is predominantly a 2G service anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. I guess some very Optus-centric questions for Paul and for Warren. Firstly Paul, just looking at the Optus guidance and suggestion of mid-single digit revenue growth. I am looking at the exit run rates for that fourth quarter which suggest that it might be a challenge to keep EBITDA at a low double-digit growth for '09 unless you're expecting some, I guess some lumpy costs coming through so we came to understand that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just looking at the G9, is there any update to funding of the G9 proposal and the G9's ability to submit a bid within the timeframe that the government's outlined. Frankly, hypothetically if the iPhone was to be launched in August would you see any benefits of securing an exclusivity deal? And if we can get some color on where your wireless broadband subs are at, and then just finally, of the 365,000, resale customers that you've still got within CMM, how many of those are actually within your own footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Tim; that was a pretty comprehensive list. Let me see how I go. I am always very nervous answering questions on guidance because I don't want to qualify our direction in any way. I was trying to get behind your question a little bit, probably if you look at our guidance, a key driver is probably still mindful for us, is the fact that it's quite hard for people outside to read one dynamic, which is what's going on with our exit out of resale. And if you look at the last 12 months, we were generating about 455 million of revenues on consumer retail.</p>
          <p>So really the driver for the top line in guidance for next year is taking into account the fact that we will be completing the exit of that space. If I was to characterize the numbers today, in fact, which might also help you looking at that. Our top line growth is about 3.8%, but if you look at our exit out of consumer resale in the year we've just been through. We basically walked away from about $90 million of consumer resale revenues because there weren't within areas we could service. And, if we'd actually left that on our revenue line that would probably have added about 1.2% to the revenue growth line.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we've had an effect this year of mobile termination rates coming down. Now they do affect other players too, it's very hard to arrive at a rate for that but it's probably 1 or 2% of impact on the revenue growth line from that as well. And so if you take those things into account maybe they help you just get a little bit shape around why we're guiding the way we are and our guidance on the EBITA as well. Is there anything else on that? Maybe you can help me answer the question better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the termination impact so, that will effectively cycle through over the next through FY '09 anyway. So I wouldn't imagine that the impact of the termination will be lower, or the termination overall rate will be lower going forwards. So I wouldn't have thought that would have as material impact as we've seen previously. I guess, I am just trying to understand given the margin profiles, that I am comfortable with the revenue growth outlook, but given the margin profiles you have actually achieved, unless you are getting some fairly lumpy costs coming through one off items, I would have thought it's pretty challenging not to break into double digit of the EBITDA line. But I understand where you are on what you can disclose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right that we're obviously we're going to be very cautious in talking about that guidance and how we qualify it. I suppose the only thing I would say, as well is that you will have noticed that over the last 12 to 18 months, in our guidance we've made sure that we allow ourselves the room to move in a very competitive market. So for example over the last 12 months in mobile, we've lifted our acquisition in postpaid directly we did about 230,000 adds in postpaid in the year just completed compared to 44,000 of previous year. And lot of that came from restarting the engines, SingTelstra's customers in particular through our black and white campaign, accepting a higher cost of acquisition because typically those were higher ARPU customers, and knowing that we had the flexibility in our guidance to be able to deliver to that. That's in contrast to maybe to way we've guided previously. So, we have deliberately allowed ourselves the flexibility to react to what goes on in the market place in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's probably what's in our mind. I'll talk about the G9. And probably the key message I'd want to add on that is, first of all, at this stage I don't believe raising the funds will be our key constraint. It is true that even after the government generates or puts in AU$4.7 billion of contribution to our network, and as per the budget last night they have indicated their desire themselves to try to manage that below the 4.7, but even with the contributions from the government and even from the contribution from cornerstone investors, there is still going to be a need to raise funds in the market place. Soundings we've done initially with some of the major financial houses here, indicate to us that the nature of the asset, the fact that it can be monetized afterward in the form of an infrastructure fund and the fact that it is such a blue chip investment means that whilst it is at the outer limit of funding requirements in a pretty tight market, there is an appetite to invest.</p>
          <p>I think, probably far more of a constraint for the G9 moving forward is, whether or not this process is going to be undertaken in such a way as to genuinely allow a level playing field both in terms of the bid and in terms of what comes out afterwards. And so the key concerns the G9 have been articulating, and what we're looking for reassurance from government on, are really three fold. First of all, the fact that that way the RFP has been structured is very much tilted towards the incumbent in things like the compressed timeframe. The fact that there is no clarity at this stage about when the information from Telstra that we require will be available. And I just point out to all those on the call that Telstra statements on Friday about that information were clearly misleading, because as it has subsequently been flushed out, there was no real detail on geographical information contained in that. So again it highlights how we need to always take our time in scrutinizing some of the statements that are made by the incumbent on this.</p>
          <p>Our second concern is really around transparency. It's important that there is clear criteria for how any bid will be evaluated and for how the business will be awarded. And we see that as a concern at the moment. And thirdly, it's really about ensuring a competitive outcome out of all of this. This is a key process that will decide the shape of the industry moving forward. Our activity in participating in the bid will legitimize that bidding process. We want to have confidence that if we participate, we're participating in something that will lead to a genuinely pro-competition outcome and not anything else.</p>
          <p>So you're looking at what's likely to constrain us moving forward on bidding, it's not so much the financial side, it's really the bidding process. In terms of the iPhone, look Allen is quite right, we are all constrained at what we can say. All I will say is at this stage there are two carriers in Australia, who have announced that they will be carrying that. So obviously if it just turns out that there are just two of us marketing that in the short-term, I'd naturally expect that's got to be very helpful for us in the marketplace. Whatever the case, whoever is competing out there you can be assured we will be pushing very aggressively and strengthening our mobile business with the iPhone.</p>
          <p>And finally on wireless broadband, if &#x2013; some of the comments that I made earlier on today in the media are probably worth repeating here on our mobile business overall. Our mobile net adds at 135,000 during the quarter; we think are pretty strong of which postpaid is about 87,000. We also continued a good prepaid revenue growth. Prepaid revenue growth was about 11% in the quarter and we still believe from our survey work that we've been increasing our lead in prepaid overall over the last 12 months. Wireless broadband is something that we've acknowledged we were later into the markets with, and certainly we acknowledged that combined with mobile termination rates has undoubtedly had some impact on our subscriber and revenue share.</p>
          <p>We did launch wireless broadband in early December and since then we've been building momentum behind the product. And as we came out of the quarter, we'd built up momentum to the stage where our run rates where at a &#x2013; roughly just about 20,000 per month. So how do you calibrate, but I will stress that we built that up over the quarter from a lower entry point. Overall the key point I'd make on mobile is that we're very committed to growing our share in mobile over the coming year. I hope you that helps you Tim in terms of proving some detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as to check on that Paul, that run rate is 20,000, is that including the Virgin mobile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just my final question was on the 365,000 retail customers left in CMM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll pass back to Warren to just comment on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, thanks Tim. Well, I think it's important; of the 365,000 off net customers remaining the essentially fall into two groups. Those customers that are outside our on-net fixed footprint and so therefore it can't be migrated to on-net, and there is a group of customers in our on-net footprint, who can't be migrated because of serviceability issues with their premises, their Internet or what have you. So the comment I'd make on that is the vast majority of our migrations have been done. Now we still have some more customers to migrate that will be substantially finished in Q2 of this year.</p>
          <p>And then what we would then be looking to do is obviously with those customers that are remaining in the off-net footprint who are outside our fixed footprint, we will be looking to marketing to them with our mobile substitution products, with I think substitution products on our mobile network. And obviously we will be looking to migrate as many of those customers as we can left with that all across on to our mobile network with those products. And the other important point to make is that those that are remaining are now paying high prices in any event, because we have put price rises through on that retail base, and so those customers are contributing more profitably to our bottom line now, then what they have in to &#x2013; than they have in the past. And you can see that applying through with our margin improvement in the consumer and small business fixed bit.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. I had actually two questions for Paul. Paul, what do you make of the ACCC related decision on deciding not &#x2013; or to deregulate de-price regulate the wholesale line rental in Australia in metro areas. And that's, should say, two year after first regulating it in the first place? That was my first question and second question was on your DSLAM footprint. I mean you're still expending DSLAM still rolling them out. There is now a reasonable prospect to get FTTN rolled out at some point in Australia. You're well aware of the risk, I mean attach to FTTN from a DSL point of view or from a ULL point of view. What is your strategy there? What is the position you want to be in when the negotiation on FTTN happens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Well in terms of the first one on the ACCC, we've seen a series of decisions from the ACCC over the last four to six weeks. All of which in their own micro sense have been argued by the ACCC as being based on specific micro economic points. But if you take them and overall it's very clear that the cumulative effect of those decisions, is unarguably to weaken competition. Particularly, in the Fixed Line Market, so our view at this stage is that we are missing an overall view from ACCC and certainly we're going to be making some advocacy to them. To look at the cumulative effect of all the various decisions and to question whether in fact they have an anticompetitive impact in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Certainly, we see that they do have that effect. Coming to the DSLAM footprint, our overall strategy is twofold. First of all, let's drive very aggressively and quickly to ensure, that we do get a return on our investment. And if you look at the growth numbers we've been driving on ULL over the last two to three quarters, you can see that we're getting some headway on that. And in terms of the FTTN debate, we are of view that anybody who's got transit asset as a results of the rollout of the new network, does need to be given some sort of offset in terms of the new world. And that could take the place in the form of more favorable pricing on access to the new network or indeed some other arrangement, but we will be advocating that quiet strongly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just back on the first question, as you said there were a number of surprising decisions. Do you see any of these decisions being driven by sort of a government agenda? And I guess, the question is; are you facing today, in Australia a much more sort pro-Telstra government and regulated than you were a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't read too much into the ACCC. I think, we're at a stage in the ACCC where the commissioner responsible for our area has yet to be reappointed. And so what you do have I believe is a series of individual decisions being made, and perhaps there isn't at this stage the leadership in the ACCC, which would have may be taken a view of the overall impact. So, I view it very much as an administrative or management issue, rather than being necessarily a sign of change in sentiment by the Commission. That's also the reason I think it's worth while us entertaining some advocacy and seeking to engage on those issues.</p>
          <p>In terms of the overall environment, I will say that I feel the RFP for FTTN, has be drafted in the way that unambiguously favors the incumbent. We see that as being a concerning development for the industry and indeed for the consumer. And as you know from a lot of my public statements, we're fairly aggressive in driving that back. And indeed you've seen the G9 just in the last 24 hours begin a public advertising campaign to make sure that we can educate the public and the decision makers on that issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last question on the wholesale line rental. Where are you currently sitting and when is your next renegotiation point with Telstra on that very specific price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we disclose our contractual terms of Telstra Laron so, I prefer not to talk about that. But in terms of the overall position we'd have on wholesale line rental, we'd obviously be arguing that our belief is that Telstra over recovers already. And that if anything those arguments are continuing to push the prices down and as you know we've had strong disputes over the last two to three years with some of the modeling that's been used to underpin these decisions.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for the call. I have three questions. Firstly, I think -- let's just get a sense of what kind of net debt EBITDA ratio, will be required to keep the investment in great credit rating. Second question would be the guidance for 17% EPS underlying growth for this coming financial year, if you could just help me understand how you could be seeing that driving the -- that number. And third question will be, just maybe if you could, maybe Allen could give some kind of look into the future to see what are the key opportunities and risk in the post MDN world from SingTel lenses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. And this is Francis Heng to answer your question on investment grade financials if you like. The rating agencies have a very open and well used framework. Standard &amp; Poor and Moody's have got different explicit quantify or quantifiable financial drivers. S&amp;P tend to look more on gearing, as in total debt over capitalization, and Moody's tend to look at retained cash flow versus net debt. I think if you go into S&amp;P and Moody's website, you can see whole schedule of the different grades of different credit ratings. You have another question related to what drives net debt. Obviously, cash flow generation from our operations, dividends from our associates would determine what sort of free cash flows we get for any financial year. And of course the rest of it is what sort of CapEx expenditure and the levels of dividend payout. Does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just coming back to net debt EBITDA, may be I could just get a sense of what kind of a levels that your bankers, from just general discussion, that your bankers will be willing to lend these days? The range, just provide some ranges and the ranges that SingTel will be comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not provide explicit targets in terms of net debt EBITDA or any other financial indicators. We have a strong balance sheet, we are rated at single A+ by S&amp;P currently and we're rated two notches higher by Moody's due to their joint effort analysis, methodologies. So from that you can get a sense that the level of financial standing, and hence the sort of financing support that we would be able to get typically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I actually asked for the drivers for the underlying EPS growth that was guided for 17% in this coming year, what would it be driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 17% EPS growth is actually the earnings growth that we registered for the financial year-end of March '07, '08. It is not a guidance for '08, '09. Sorry, I am not sure where <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. Sorry. Thanks for clearing that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe Allen can talk about full MMP &#x2013; MDN sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think what MDN does is provide ultra high-speed fiber access to all business and residential premises, so what would happen post MDN is that SingTel will have to complete, not just price per megabyte. So I think you will see us having already execute on things like branding, customer experience, new applications and services. So in the consumer segment, we are already preparing for that, and we already have a Pay TV product out there with self-content and aggregates content. In the business service, we're moving much more aggressively into managed services in terms of email managed web services and the like. So much more focus by SingTel moving from being just a provider of carriage services to one that's providing much more applications, content and managed services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow up question, I think that a few quarters ago, you mentioned to expect market compression on the Singapore side because the Singapore businesses is in the process of re-investment or repositioning in a way. How far are we through that exercise in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are at the start of the exercise to be very frank, you will see that in our numbers we already our -- we already have some cost due to content cost. For IPTV, we will have -- be having more of that as we get more customers and certainly as we start to host more applications that will be a cost that will affect us as well but there will be revenue to go with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we have Mr. Suresh Mahadevan from UBS, Singapore. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I have two quick questions. One is related to your overseas acquisitions in Bharti. Given that Bharti is now clearly looking for overseas acquisitions, what options does SingTel have for resolving any conflicts that may arise such as A, lets say if SingTel has a difference in opinion in terms of the attractiveness of an acquisition or B, if SingTel is also interested in making the same acquisition. I mean, is there any clauses or anything in the shareholder agreement that protects you, given you're, effectively a 30.5% shareholder? The second question is for Allen on full MNP in Singapore, how would you see -- what would you see as the implications for SingTel and also could you give us a sense of what percentage of your postpaid subscriber basis kind of contracted? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think rather than limit your question on the associates' acquisition activity to Bharti, maybe I could talk about it in general terms. Our objective in investing in our associates is really to help them grow and so that they could be more profitable, more successful than &#x2013; for SingTel and the shareholder.</p>
          <p>So whether it is a decision that to make a new investment of significant CapEx expenditure, we work through our representatives, through the people who may be working the company, look at this proposal and look at what makes sense for the associate.</p>
          <p>Although we have certain rights in our shareholder's agreement, we don't believe in using those shareholder's rights, we would rather look at how we can come to a position on an agreement basis and it will be hopefully an outcome that maximizes value, maximizes value for our shareholders and for our associates as well.</p>
          <p>There has actually been very few instances where there is a conflict. When we look at investment opportunity from SingTel perspective <mark type="inaudible" /> other regions, it make sense to go invest with one associate we're more than happy to do that.</p>

          <p>Suresh, Allen here. Regarding the implications of MNP, we see MNP as opportunity for us to win higher value customers from our competitors, those who in the past had not moved across to us because they wanted to keep their number. In terms of percentage of our postpaid base that is contracted, we don't reveal that number, but you can tell from our chain which is at 0.8%, significantly lower than our competitors, that we have done a good job in terms of making sure that our number, our percentage of customers contracted remains as high as possible.</p>

          <p>Next we have Ms. Reena Verma from Merrill Lynch in India. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I have a few quick questions. First one is, it seems from where I sit that regulatory risks across your markets are on the rise. Can you please comment on that and whether you see it changing? Also from the standpoint of competitive intensity, can you please comment on whether you think the risks in Indonesia are tactical or whether you think these are more structural as in they may go on for few years? On the Jakarta Court ruling, can you please help us understand the timelines of your legal options please? And finally on Singapore, I am just wondering if I am reading the numbers right here, but it looks like you've had a quarter-on-quarter decline in margins as well compared with other players that have at least posted some improvement quarter-on-quarter, although your acquisition costs do not seem to have moved up as sharply. Can you please help us understand what we should attribute this to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will get Chuan Poh to answer the question on regulatory risk, KPPU, et cetera and the competition in Indonesia, and then Allen can talk about the Singapore margins after that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one must realize that investing in emerging markets, you have to say for the fact that these are all markets in infancy, both in terms of the business as well as in terms of government policy. So there will some risks associated over time. Generally, it is within our own ability to manage.</p>
          <p>In the case of KPPU, I think we make our stand very clear that as what they have found is totally baseless and we have made our view as such. And with the district court current judgment, we have not exhausted all the judicial processes yet. We are considering that there will be further appeals made to the Supreme Court of the country, and we are confident that justice will prevail.</p>
          <p>So at this stage in time it's premature to really speculate on the outcome such as divestment, timeframe and so and so forth. Those are some things that we will not contemplate at this stage in time.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you please comment on the timeline for your legal options? As in let's say, do you have to appeal to the Supreme Court in X number of days, and then -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Within the next 14 days, we have to consider going up to lodge an appeal, and then when the next hearing will be will depend on how the court schedules their hearings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if the Supreme Court were to give an adverse judgment, within what timeframe do you have to seek international arbitration? Is that an option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is an option that we are not contemplating at the present moment. I think the deal process has not been exhausted. Arbitration on an international basis is something that we can consider, but not at this stage in time.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your question on the Singapore margin, the percentage EBITDA margin has declined Q-on-Q, and they're driven primarily by mobile at 80s now. I think what we have done there is that we clearly want to make sure that we maintain our leadership position and you can see we acquired a record number of customers. So that has driven the percentage margin decline.</p>
          <p>I think you also mentioned that our competitors didn't have the same decline. I think I beg to differ on that, because I think the startup percentage EBITDA margin has also declined and they have acquired a lot less customers than us in the same period. So I think that I just want to correct one fact that &#x2013; I hope my answers to your question is okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was looking more at the quarter-on-quarter margin trend and for startup as well, I thought that the quarter-on-quarter mobile margins moved up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but again, we acquired much less number of customers than we have for the quarter, and that drives a lot of the margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on both Indonesia and in other markets, can you please comment on the competitive intensity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>It will be great if you can do it for all the markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just too much to go through for all the markets. But for Indonesia, as we have said so already, the competition is becoming a lot more aggressive because of the number of new players that just entered the market. But it is nowhere near as competitive as India. And you're from India, you should know the situation. So it is something that we anticipated, and we are dealing with it.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Just a question on Singapore margins again. What do you see as the impact of the Indian model on your margins longer term? Secondly, you mentioned that the strategic options in Middle East and Africa. Just wanted to see whether you look at these markets any differently to the Asian markets, and whether your investment criteria is any different there? And just thirdly, just in your dividend payout ratio which has increased this year but still as a total payout is well below the prior years. I just wanted to get a sense for how long the high CapEx in Singapore and Australia will last and what's the prospect for the capital management down the track? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the MTN impact on margins is probably a bit premature. We don't expect the MTN rollout to be completed. From 2012, I think there'd be a lot of development in the market between now and 2012, so we will call it for one more and I'll give you an assessment as we see how the market develops.</p>
          <p>On your question on investments, let's see, our focus continues to be in Asia, and as we had indicated on many occasions, we want to be a strategic investor, not a pure portfolio investor, which means that we do want to understand the markets that we're investing in so that we can value add to the operations. We have pledged that we are beginning to learn some new markets, Central Asia, Middle East, Africa, and I suppose at the stage where we feel that we know the markets sufficiently well to add value, we'd be prepared to make an investment there.</p>
          <p>Dividend payout ratio, I think what we have done is, we've actually moved the range up and also widened the range, so we've moved from 40 to 50% payout ratio, to 45 to 60% payout ratio. And that reflects the strong cash generation from Singapore, Australia and the associates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the CapEx, as far as the increase in Singapore and Australia over the next year, how long do you expect that to last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think if you look at the CapEx, it's directly related to the level of sales activities. So if you look at the double-digit revenue growth that we are seeing in Singapore, you would expect that expansion CapEx in mobile would be necessary. With the development in the fixed line area, upgrading of a network is also necessary. So we have seen an increase in the CapEx levels in Singapore.</p>
          <p>Likewise in Australia, where we are here expending our 3G coverage, you've seen continued investment in that area. And in addition to that, we also have investment for our satellite &#x2013; additional satellite for Australia.</p>
          <p>So I think each of this CapEx, it would be justified based on its results, and that's part of the financial discipline that you can expect from SingTel Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And if I could, just one final question, just on your IPTV service and how important it is to actually acquire some of the mainstream sort of popular content over the next few years. And could you give a sense of the kind of financial discipline that we looked in to bid for those content rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think with regard to IPTV, we have secured a very important piece of content for next year with the Champions League and UEFA Cup. We also have a very good flow of content related to movies and recent movies as well. We will continue to make sure that we upgrade our content availability, and primarily because it's content that would have to pick up a bit.</p>
          <p>But as Sock Koong has mentioned, we do in all investment that we make including content, have a great disciplined approach to looking at what's the payback, what's the return we get on making those investments.</p>
