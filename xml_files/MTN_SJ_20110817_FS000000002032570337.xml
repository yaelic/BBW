        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of MTN Group, its board of directors, its 35,000 staff spread across 21 countries, I wish to welcome you today to our interim results presentation.</p>
          <p>And thanks for taking your time to be with us today. We also wish to welcome our colleagues who are watching this broadcast and the presentation through various means of mediums, and also the broadcast networks which are taking this feed live as we are now. For that, we would like to ask you to please switch off your phones because we want to make sure that there is a seamless transmission to all of those people who would like to hear the presentation.</p>
          <p>As it is customary, our group President and CEO, Mr. Sifiso Dabengwa, and our Chief Financial Officer will take you through the presentation. The presentation will last about an hour and a half; and then after the presentation, you will then be given the opportunity to ask questions. We ask you please indicate who you are and where you come from, so that we can be able to take &#x2013; to answer your question clearly.</p>
          <p>To members of the media who are here today who have asked for one-on-one interviews with our group President and CEO, my colleagues [Sylvanis and Kholisa] will be able to manage that at the end. So, now let me welcome our group President and CEO to take us through the first stage of our presentation.</p>
          <p>Sifiso?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>To members of the group Board, my colleagues in ExCo, all the MTN staff around Africa and around the Middle East, and ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending this presentation. I will take you through the strategic and operational overview and then Nazir will take you through the financials.</p>
          <p>Starting off with our vision, nothing has changed as far as that is concerned. We still have a vision to be a leader in telecommunications in emerging markets through convergence and operational evolution. And we are seeing opportunities coming out in that area and I will talk further around some of the plans that we have, leveraging our existing footprint and our intellectual capacity, and then also looking for opportunities for consolidation and diversification.</p>
          <p>The overall environment is seeing increased competitiveness and we still see us being able to deal with all these issues through ensuring that we implement best practices across our operations. We have initiated over a period our hub and trust initiatives, which as I will speak to you further, which we have now converted more that were very regionally based, which we are now looking more from a global perspective in terms of shared services.</p>
          <p>Our procurement initiatives have initiated &#x2013; have been initiated and are now taking shape. And our brand continues to be strong and we continue to support our brand wherever we are and making sure that our value propositions are reflective of the market segments which we serve. If I look at the group highlights for the six months to June, you see that the group subscribers are up to 153 million, up 7.5% from December last year. Our EBITDA margin from June is up 1.3% to 44.6%.</p>
          <p>The approximate free cash flow, which is really our EBITDA less CapEx, is up 23.7% to R19.5 billion, and our adjusted headline earnings up 7.2% to R4.701. The Board has decided to declare an interim dividend per share of R2.73 and the Board has also decided to increase the payout ratio to 65%.</p>
          <p>Just a quick look at some of the strategic considerations, we see that from a revenue growth perspective, market share still remains an important priority for our group. In all our operations, we have a clear strategic priority of maintaining and/or increasing our market share.</p>
          <p>The penetration levels in most of our operations are still such that there's growth opportunities. And at this moment in time, in most of our operations, the penetration levels vary between about 30% and about 55%, and hence we believe that there's still more opportunities for growth. We are continuing to leverage the data service opportunities, and at this moment in time about 12.3% of total revenue is coming through from data.</p>
          <p>The Business Solutions in South Africa, the revenue is up 16.5%. We continue to roll out mobile money. We currently have about 5.1 million subscribers in 12 countries and we will continue to invest in infrastructure to support both voice and non-voice revenue. And, I guess, key to the issue of investment in infrastructure, it's important that we maintain our network quality at acceptable levels in all our operations.</p>
          <p>From a cost optimization point of view, the procurement initiative that was started late last year is gaining momentum and we have identified areas in which cost savings will be focused on. We have implemented an IT shared services for South and East Africa, and now we are looking at shared services across more parts of our activities.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure sharing and value unlock, we did discuss the Ghana initiative at the last presentation and we will continue to seek other opportunities in terms of cost optimization.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the key macro considerations, the exposure to currencies other than important currency has, obviously, had an impact on our first half results as 68% of our revenues is non-rand. Also some of the local currencies in the countries which we operate in have also experienced some weakness that has had a further impact.</p>
          <p>From a constant currency point of view, the revenue growth to June is actually 9.5% and EBITDA growth has been 14%. And that's important for us if you look at it from the point of view that the EBITDA growth rate is still higher than the revenue growth rate. The net finance costs and CapEx have been positively impacted to a limited extent.</p>
          <p>In terms of some of the country risks where we are operating, we have had some political unrest in some of our operations that has made the operating environment a little bit &#x2013; quite difficult. And I must emphasize that in all these cases where we've had this unrest, we have been able to continue operating, although in most of the cases there has been a little bit of a deterioration, not a significant, but a little deterioration in the performance.</p>
          <p>The Syria BOT conversion has been delayed, also impacted by the unrest in Syria. South Sudan, we have initiated a project to develop an operation in South Sudan as a result of the separation of the two &#x2013; into two countries. Cote d'Ivoire, I'm pleased to say, our operation is gaining momentum slowly as the country settles down. And the dispute in Guinea Conakry was resolved and we do not believe at this stage there is anything to be concerned about as far as that's concerned.</p>
          <p>Just some of the key regulatory considerations, SIM registration has been implemented in most countries. In South Africa, we met the June deadline. We had to suspend about 340,000 subscribers, some of which have started coming back. The Nigeria deadline is still September 28. 50% of the base has been registered by June. Ghana, the deadline is still September and &#x2013; sorry, the deadline has been extended from July to September, sorry. And as at June, we had 90% registered.</p>
          <p>From a mobile money point of view, we now have obtained licenses in 12 countries and Nigeria is expected to launch shortly, but on a different model in which the banks play a much bigger role than we normally would have.</p>
          <p>From a frequencies perspective, in South Africa, we are expecting an auction process for the 800 megahertz and 2.6 gigahertz anytime during the course of this year or maybe early next year. And in Congo-Brazzaville and Benin, we expect a process for the issuing of 3G licenses during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of mobile termination rates, the South Africa glide path has been established. We are not expecting at this stage any further considerations from any of the regulators as far as reductions in mobile termination rates are concerned.</p>
          <p>Looking at the overall operational considerations, I guess the core to everything that we do and that we work on is really how we impact on the customer experience. And from that perspective, some of the key factors that we look at is the quality of service, making sure that we have an efficient distribution. We have spent quite a lot of time and effort ensuring that our segmentation reflects the market that we're in.</p>
          <p>We also have very strong training and development processes to ensure that we get experienced people in our organizations. And we have, as you have seen earlier on in this year, focused quite extensively on our products and services and we have reorganized in a manner that enables us to improve on our delivery of products and services. And then we also focus quite extensively on ensuring that our brand preference remains very high in all the markets.</p>
          <p>And then looking at it from an external perspective, the competitive environment has been evolving and it is getting stronger. We are continuing to meet the regulatory requirement. And all that from an internal perspective is forcing us or making us re-look a number of our financial and operational frameworks quite extensively to ensure that at the end of the day, the customers' experience is such that we are able to maintain strong positions in all the markets that we are in.</p>
          <p>Some of the key characteristics of the period under review. I have already indicated that we are experiencing increased competition in most of our markets. We are maintaining market share and we intend to maintain market share in most of the markets despite the increase in competition. The competition is leading to declining voice and data tariffs quite rapidly.</p>
          <p>And then also as a result of the competitive space, we are seeing that because of the other operators or our competitors reducing their off-net tariffs as part of their strategies to increase their customer base, we are seeing an increase in incoming traffic as a result of reduced off-net tariffs. And overall, we are seeing very good increases in billed minutes throughout our business.</p>
          <p>We are experiencing political instability in a number of markets as indicated, but, like I said, our operations have managed to keep functioning and functioning reasonably well. And in all our operations, we really have not experienced any serious destruction to property or losses of people.</p>
          <p>Our data growth strategy is still very much an important part of our business. Usage is increasing. We are seeing very good growth as far as traffic is concerned, but we still do face continuously competitive pricing in that particular area. We have also initiated our handset strategy, which will focus primarily on partnering with other players in the handset space, and we are focusing on making sure that we do get low-end smartphones distributed throughout our markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost optimization, we have completed the first tower deal, as you are aware. The procurement transformation, as I've indicated, is very much on track. We are looking at other shared services as we have already initiated the IT services in the southern region. We will continue with outsourcing and managed services, which is a strategy we started a few years back. And also that we do see a reduction in terms of our marketing and sponsorship costs post the 2010 FIFA World Cup.</p>
          <p>Also during this period under review, you will notice that our capital expenditure has been lower than where we would have been, say, last year, but we expect that this will pick up and already major commitments have been made as I will show later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Looking at some of the key markets and starting with South Africa, looking from a subscriber point of view, we've had a 5.1% growth. And as at the end of the June period, we had ended up just below R20 million at R19.7 million driven primarily by our prepaid growth which, again, has continued to perform well.</p>
          <p>And as far as the post-paid side, that's driven primarily by the hybrid packages. That seemed to continue to gain favor and support within our customer base. Our market share is relatively stable in the 35% to 36% region. And from an on-net traffic point of view, we've seen an increase of traffic within our network.</p>
          <p>Revenue has increased by 5% &#x2013; sorry, 6% to R18.1 billion. And we see that the data revenue is up 14%; that's including SMS. And excluding SMS, it's about, say, 18%. We have 4.6 million 3G devices, of which 2.6 million are smartphones, and we now have 9.5 million data users. Airtime and subscription revenue went up 4.8%, just below 5%. And overall, we have seen a good growth in the number of handsets that were distributed.</p>
          <p>From an OpEx point of view, we've seen good reduction and we've been successful in reducing our commission and distribution costs. And as indicated, our marketing costs have come down. Maintenance costs have been stable, and the one area which is driven by the handset upgrades we have seen a higher cost in terms of upgrades, driven primarily by subscribers looking for higher-end handsets. So, overall, we reasonably are comfortable with the OpEx line at this stage.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, most of the projects are on track. We have been doing a lot of work in terms of enhancing our network and making it much more IP-based. The fiber projects are all progressing well. We have initiated LTE trials and we continue with our strategy of increasing on self-provisioning, and that's also working very well in parallel with the fiber projects.</p>
          <p>Looking at Nigeria &#x2013; Nigeria, at the end of June, we're just over 40 million subscribers, a 4.8 percentage growth. We did have a rather slow response to quite extensive pricing competition in the second quarter of the period. That did result in a slight loss of market share. The issues that impacted the market share loss have been addressed and we are seeing our way back into the position that we have been in terms of market share of net adds.</p>
          <p>There has been &#x2013; there was lower gross connections due to the SIM registration process as well. We have, however, increased the on-net market share in terms of traffic and we have seen a reduction &#x2013; an overall reduction in tariffs. During this first half, we have seen really extensive competition, but like I said, we have readjusted to ensure that we do get our market share back to where it was in terms of net adds.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, interconnect has played an important part in the sense that there has been quite an increase in incoming calls. There has been a slower growth in terms of airtime and subscription revenue, but we have seen strong growth from a data point of view, but that's also because we're starting off from a low base.</p>
          <p>Looking at OpEx, OpEx in Nigeria is still very well managed. The cost base is still very well controlled. We've had an increase of just about 18% in terms of network operating costs, but that really is a direct result of expanding the network, impacted primarily by the site leases and the fuel costs. Our deployment of hybrid power systems to manage the fuel cost down is well advanced, and that will continue for some time. Marketing expenses have come down and there has been a reduction in transmission costs, following the commencement of the main one undersea cable that links West Africa to Europe.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, also in Nigeria, we were slower than we had planned, but we do anticipate that we will catch-up by the end of the year. Busy hour congestion is still at acceptable levels, so overall network quality has not deteriorated and we expect that we will be able to maintain that.</p>
          <p>We did experience negative &#x2013; or, let's say, the customers did experience bad network quality that was specifically because of a product that we launched around February, March which had an extremely positive customer response that resulted in the network being congested. But that was quickly taken off the market. And obviously, as we go forward, whatever we launch in the market, we'll always take into consideration the impact on the quality of the network.</p>
          <p>If I move on to Ghana, Ghana has maintained a market share of about 53% despite very aggressive competition. From a subscriber point of view, we've had a 9.6% growth. And as at the end of the period, we had just over 9.5 million subscribers. We've had an increase in off-net traffic, and that was also as part of our competitive positioning where we had to respond to our competitors who had significantly reduced their off-net pricing. At this stage, we are experiencing stable tariffs and there hasn't really been much of a decrease in the most recent past.</p>
          <p>From a revenue perspective, we see that the interconnect revenue was up by 48% due to the lower off-net tariffs. The airtime and subscription revenue went up 9.5% and we've also had good data growth excluding SMS.</p>
          <p>We've had an OpEx increase of about 19%. That's excluding the profit from the sale of the first 400 sites to the tower company. The network operating costs went up about 51%. That's primarily as a result of the hike in rent and utilities, distribution and selling costs were down about 1%, interconnect costs up as a direct result of the tariff trends in the market, and then at this stage we still haven't had much of an impact as far as the leasing of outsourced towers in the period.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, we had a slow rollout as a direct result of changes in our tower approval process and in the way that we work now that we have gone through the tower sale process. And the increase in busy hour congestion that we experienced in the second quarter, that is being managed. We believe that it was not that significant and that the work that is being done on the network will have that congestion at acceptable levels in a very short period.</p>
          <p>Looking at Iran, Iran has continued to perform very well. Our market share has been held at 44% and we've maintained the on-net traffic. Tariffs in Iran have been very stable and the overall market has been stimulated by usage stimulation promotions.</p>
          <p>At the end of the period, we were at 32 million subscribers, which was a growth of 8.2% from December 2010. From a revenue point of view, we experienced very high growth in SMS revenue due to the introduction of Farsi SMSs. Overall, there's been good growth in subscription and airtime revenue and data continues to gain momentum throughout the market.</p>
          <p>And then from an OpEx point of view, cost containment initiatives in the various parts have worked very well. Our distribution costs, again, are very well managed. We've been able to manage the overall cost structures of this business very well, and that continues &#x2013; and we'll see that continue going forward. Also the lower costs offset higher price hikes in electricity and fuel costs due to the withdrawal of government subsidies.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, again, we did have a slower rollout as a direct result of equipment delivery delays and delays in site approval processes. But as far as the population and geographic coverage, that has also improved. Our busy hour congestion has remained less than one. And we've continued our WiMAX rollout throughout the different regions of Iran.</p>
          <p>Looking at Syria, as I indicated earlier on, political unrest did impact on the business, and, again, I must emphasize, not that significantly. And also the BOT process has not been initiated as yet, so we are still negotiating and discussing with the authorities. The tariffs have remained stable throughout the period.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, instability has impacted revenue slightly. Airtime and subscription revenue have remained flat and data revenue has increased 44%.</p>
          <p>From an OpEx point of view, we have experienced lower commissions and the network operating costs are lower. Selling, distribution and marketing costs are down and general expenses are down marginally.</p>
          <p>And then from a CapEx point of view, the delays in the license conversion have obviously impacted the CapEx program. There have been delays also as a direct result of equipment availability and of security concerns in some parts of our networks. And the network is under pressure in some parts as a direct result of work not necessarily being done on time and also getting access to those areas as a direct result of the security situation.</p>
          <p>Just to look at the whole CapEx issues, I've indicated the fact that we are behind from a financial point of view, you will see that what we're trying to show here is the fact that from a commitment point of view, we are significantly up. So, we believe that by the end of the year we will meet our guidance.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will just hand over to Nazir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all. Good morning to members of the MTN Group Board, the MTN &#x2013; the SA Board, members of ExCo, all the MTNers out there and, of course, honored guests. I'll take you through the financial highlights. Sifiso has covered a number of points of revenue and EBITDA for the major operations, so I'll focus largely on the group numbers.</p>
          <p>Looking at the financial highlights, the key feature of the results clearly once again has been the impact of the rand and its behavior against some of the underlying currencies in the group. And I have a chart in a couple of slides just a bit further on that will take us through the impact of that. But clearly, if we look at the average rate of the ZAR in the first six months of 2010, the average rate was about R7.52 and in the first six months of 2011 at R6.80, so it's about a 10% swing. And that has clearly had a fairly dampening effect on the reported results that we have in front of us. Revenue as a consequence is up just marginally by about 1%.</p>
          <p>OpEx quite well controlled overall to drive EBITDA margins a bit higher, but what I'd like to draw your attention to is the fact that 44.6% EBITDA margin as we reported do include some one-time items of a non-recurring nature, and I will qualify that as I go forward. These items principally are the first tranche or the impact of the profit on the first sale of the towers in terms of the agreement with ATC for Ghana and also a one-time settlement of the Guinea Conakry claim &#x2013; settlement dispute.</p>
          <p>I was asked to pause on this to just inform members of the audience that the settlement costs relating to the Guinea Conakry dispute need to be booked as a one-time item; in other words, expensed in the month that the transaction occurred or the settlement was paid. So, there's no amortization of that cost over a period of time.</p>
          <p>The Ghana telco profit which really relates to the profit on the first 400 towers which we transferred as part of the agreement, the agreement actually will be completed over three different tranches. The full profit on the sale is about $300 million. What's recognized in the first part of these results is about a $68 million profit which equates to $445 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding those two non&#x2010;recurring or one&#x2010;time items, normalized group EBITDA margin would be at about 44%, which is about seven&#x2010;tenths of a point increase over the last reporting period. I think it just goes out to show that we've seen the impact of all the positive things that the underlying operating companies are doing and we see the impact of that upstreaming to the group reported results as far as cost optimization and therefore improvement in the overall margin rate as well as nominal EBITDA for the group.</p>
          <p>Clearly, another big feature really is the delay in the CapEx spend, so it has driven free cash flow, which is adjusted free cash flow of EBITDA minus CapEx, quite significantly higher. I think we should caution that as we go into the second half, that rate of increase year-on-year will come down as we ratchet up our CapEx spend. I will talk a little bit further about CapEx as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The interim dividend, as I mentioned earlier, has been lifted up to R2.73. The Board has approved picking out the payout ratio from 55% to 65%. The way the R2.73 is calibrated, it's really established in the basis of a 30% payout of the full-year adjusted HEPS for 2010. So, if you take the R9.09 adjusted headline earnings per share of last year, 30% will give you approximately R2.73. So, the split for the full year is approximately based on our current forecast, roughly 40/60. Of course, that's likely to be impacted quite severely by exchange rate movements as we go into the second half.</p>
          <p>Just some things for the accountants, we have reduced our shareholding in Zambia as part of an early agreement down to about 86%. We do, however, still consolidate what we consolidated at the end of December. That's roughly 98.7%. I've talked about the Ghana tower sale. We've taken the profit in the first tranche of the transfer of the towers, which are 400 out of the total 1,700 that will be transferred as part of this agreement.</p>
          <p>And the second phase should be completed sometime in August &#x2013; it has been completed. Khumo [Khumo Shuenyane] has just informed me. And the final phase hopefully by year-end. So, in the second half, I guess, we will have some more one-timers, taking us to the full completion of that transaction.</p>
          <p>An event which occurred just recently, in fact, finalized on 15 of August, and this was largely due to keep the analysts happy because we had an interest in cleaning up our P&amp;L because we have negotiated a conclusion of the IFC put option. We've acquired the 3% interest for $390 million. That transaction was consummated on &#x2013; or completed on 15 of August. It will be acquired through a subsidiary of Dubai as we go forward, purely to manage the forex issues related to that particular transaction. We have also offered about 0.4% of that to our local shareholders in Nigeria and there is an anticipation that it might be taken up by one or some of the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Talking about the put option itself, as far as Nigeria effect is concerned, what we've reflected here is the agreement that was finalized in terms of the $390 million, which has effectively reduced the charge in terms of the fair value adjustment; in other words, has brought it down. The transaction was valued lower than what we had valued the liability at at the previous reporting period. That net effect is about R70 million for Nigeria.</p>
          <p>But, again, I think the key point here to make is, as we go forward, the traction related to this will be removed from the income statement and I think our results will hopefully, at least at an earnings per share level, be much easier understood. The Afghanistan put option, of course, will continue for a while, but the impact of that is likely to be immaterial as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The group effective tax rate compared to the last six-month reporting period at the end of June 2010 has crept up a little bit by about two-tenths of a point. And, again, I will unpack this a little bit later in one of the further slides.</p>
          <p>STC is a large contributor to that. As you know, we raised our group dividend at the end of March, and that came up &#x2013; accounted for about 3.83% of the overall tax charge. Furthermore, withholding taxes, and I will unpack that a little bit more further on in the presentation, accounted for a further 3.28%. And as we all know, the Nigeria education tax has been around for a while, and that accounts for about 1.1%.</p>
          <p>Just a quick summary then, looking at the top section of this slide, we see the impact of the moves of all the key currencies in the group to the US dollar. At the bottom section of the slide is really the cross-rate impacts to the ZAR. Key feature to note here is the last line which is shaded in yellow on the top part of the graph. It shows the rand in the first six months of 2010 versus the first six months of 2011 &#x2013; keeping in mind that these are average rates &#x2013; has strengthened by 10%, whilst the others have all moved between a band of 2% to 6% negatively against the dollar in the same period. So, that translated into, I guess, a decrease in the cross-rate relative to the ZAR based on the strength of the ZAR in that period of 14%, 16% and 13%, clearly having a fairly significant impact on the ZAR reported results that we have shown you in the first slide.</p>
          <p>So, looking at revenue again fairly quickly, we have seen as a result &#x2013; keep in mind that these are rand-reported results. So, despite the increase in local currency revenues, we see rand-reported results on a comparative basis for airtime revenues reduced by about 3%.</p>
          <p>Interconnect, again, based on comments that Sifiso made earlier, we've seen quite a push in incoming interconnect traffic and therefore incoming interconnect revenue. That's picked up on a group reported level by 4%. Revenue on a constant currency basis, which is shown on the right-hand side of the slide, would have been about 9% higher.</p>
          <p>What we've reported on slide one is 56.5%. If we had restated these numbers using the same constant currency that we applied, in other words, the R7.52 average from last year's six months, that number would be at about R61.2 billion. So, overall, the currency movement has had about an 8% negative impact on the rand-reported revenues.</p>
          <p>The underlying local currency revenue growth, as Sifiso pointed out earlier, is still fairly solid. Nigeria is still growing at 13%. So, the mix between airtime revenue growth as well as incoming interconnect traffic has changed quite significantly. RSA has grown by about 6%, Iran by 28% despite the challenges we're having with a few issues in the country, and Ghana by about 12%.</p>
          <p>Moving up, just unpacking the revenue a little bit more, the pleasing aspect of this is to see despite the fairly significant pricing issues that we face on the data side, data growing quite strongly by 24% year-on-year from R2.8 billion to about R3.6 billion. It now accounts for group revenue of about the same percentage as SMS. The SMS and data combined on a group basis is now 12% of total revenue. That's about a one point pickup from the last financial year.</p>
          <p>Interconnect, R8.6 billion. And despite, I guess, the lower interconnect in South Africa as we move through the glide path, we see most of that increase coming through from the traffic &#x2013; incoming interconnect traffic especially in Nigeria and Ghana as we see more aggressive off-net pricing actions by competitors.</p>
          <p>Talking about interconnect, again, if you look at the overall group position, margins have picked up &#x2013; 2011 is in the top part of the slide and 2010 at the bottom part &#x2013; by about 3 percentage points. Again, we talked about the glide path in South Africa, moved down for peak rate from R0.89 to R0.73 and off-peak from R0.77 to R0.65. That's had the effect of reducing year-on-year interconnect for South Africa by about 10%.</p>
          <p>However, in Nigeria and Ghana, we saw quite strong increases, as we've mentioned several times now, of incoming interconnect traffic. So, interconnect traffic has been pushed up quite significantly. Overall, however, a good result in terms of the margin performance and margins overall have improved by about 3 percentage points, which translates to just roughly 300-odd-million rand for the group.</p>
          <p>OpEx, again, a good news story, largely under control for the group. Selling, marketing and distribution expenses have reduced. Again, not a surprise, we had fairly big spend in marketing costs in 2010 related to the FIFA program. That's now all washed out of the system and there has been a fairly strong focus in terms of managing the commission costs into channels across the group, and that benefit has come through quite successfully as well.</p>
          <p>We've seen the cost of handsets and accessories go up, again largely driven by South Africa. Larger prepaid volumes coming through &#x2013; that's in about 30% year-on-year &#x2013; and that's pushed the total cost of the handsets up. We've also seen a higher demand for upgrade in terms of the quality of handsets, so that's driven costs up while volumes have remained roughly flat or maybe slightly on a lower downward trend.</p>
          <p>A key point to mention here as well is the impact of Nigeria diesel costs. And despite that, we have managed, as I will talk about in the next slide, to manage Nigeria margins quite satisfactorily on a half year-to-date basis. But this change in the diesel costs that we're all familiar with has about five-tenths of a point impact on revenue on the Nigeria P&amp;L. So, at the end of June 2010, diesel costs alone would have accounted for about 3.1% of overall revenues.</p>
          <p>At the end of June 2011, it accounts for 3.6% of overall revenues. And if you look at the comparative on OpEx, which is also interesting, excluding cost of sales, it consumes about 19% of total OpEx for Nigeria. We, last year, consumed about 15%. So, managing diesel costs and the hybrid power solutions that Sifiso mentioned earlier is quite an important strategy for us to manage that cost as we go forward.</p>
          <p>EBITDA, overall, as I said, a good news story. We've picked that up seven-tenths of a point on a normalized basis excluding the impact of the one-time items. So, 44% is a good story. And cost optimization, obviously, as I talked about, has had an important positive impact on that.</p>
          <p>The other point to note, however, is when Nigeria, RSA and Iran all perform well in terms of managing their costs and lifting up their margins, the group margins, obviously, benefit. And in this year, a large part of that coming through in the numbers. So, Nigeria picked up by about 17%, RSA about 9%, growing revenue much faster than the cost increase despite the challenges from the interconnect side, and Iran growing by about 31% where their revenue grew probably about 4 or 5 points lower.</p>
          <p>The impact of that in terms of the contribution to the group EBITDA margin really is Nigeria contributes, comparing last year's half-year numbers to this year's half-year numbers, about six-tenths of a point improvement. There, it picked up the overall six-month comparative margin base by close to 2%, RSA by about three-tenths of a point, Iran by about 0.1 or one-tenth of a point, but their overall margin improvement was almost a full percent. Excluding FX, that could have been about 45.1% on a constant currency basis. So, a good news story all round, good margin expansion coming through.</p>
          <p>Important points to note, and we've had questions on this previously, is to talk about the performance of Sudan. We've had &#x2013; we reported our dissatisfaction as a management team in terms of the performance of that operation. It's clear to say that all the strategies that we've been focusing on for the last 18 months, we have now started paying dividends.</p>
          <p>We've seen strong subscriber growth coming through from the operation. We've got at half year more than 1.1 million net adds. We expect to have a fairly decent second half in terms of net adds. But more importantly, we see good cost control, expansion in EBITDA margin, now sitting at 19%. We expect that to continue growing. And very importantly, we see constant local currency revenue growth month-to-month, and that's very, very pleasing for the operation.</p>
          <p>The other point to note is Cote d'Ivoire. It seems to have recovered very, very quickly after the political settlements have been reached and margins are now trending much higher, including the issues that we were dealing with in the past hopefully are now behind us as well.</p>
          <p>CapEx &#x2013; issues that are driving down the lower CapEx, whilst the substantial part of the CapEx which the VPs and CEOs of the large companies assure us has been committed or will be committed in the next month or so. The impact on the balance sheet and the cash flow has been muted for the first half. So, we expect, as I said earlier, to see that accelerate in the second half.</p>
          <p>We've had some logistics delays. We had late delivery issues again from some key vendors. We've had some &#x2013; we had a smaller impact in terms of the FX, the weaker FX or the stronger FX of rand. That impact is about R0.6 billion. Overall, however, I think it is fair to say this is an area of high focus in terms of making sure that we are able to deliver capacity, quality of service, and also roll out our data expansion needs to be ready for the market as we go forward and to manage our data strategy as well in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>The guidance, therefore, for CapEx is still roughly the same at about R22 billion. Again, we've left the authorized CapEx exchange rate at R7.42; you'll see the numbers right at the bottom of the slide, which is based on what we showed you earlier in the year. The likelihood is that we're going to get a positive impact on the rand because the forecasts in rand, I think, are still fairly bullish going out in the second half despite the recent volatility in the currency.</p>
          <p>So, overall, while we see the R22 billion, we expect a substantial part of that could be as high as 90% committed by end of the year. It could be 100% committed by end of the year. The impact on capitalization and cash flow is likely to be lower and could be anything between 80% to 90%. I expect the cash flow impact to be lower. Capitalization should be at the higher end of the 80% to 90% range.</p>
          <p>So, looking at EBITDA minus CapEx, again, as I said, this looks great right now, but it's really related to the under-spend of the CapEx. So, if you look at the EBITDA minus CapEx, 34.5% for half year compared to 28.1% this year, so there's about R$3 billion or R$4 billion swing that you should add to that number where we would have expected to have spent a bit more on CapEx at this time.</p>
          <p>On the interest and tax line, net interest rate has come down by about R300 million, largely due to the fact that we are carrying significantly higher cash balances across the group. So, it's really a factor of interest income as opposed to lower interest expenses. Net forex losses are entirely due to Iran loans in Dubai. Last year, we had a charge of R563 million. The movements in the euro versus the functional currency in Dubai has now caused a swing in that number and overall that 957 to 164 is entirely related to that.</p>
          <p>Functional currency has moved out from 70 to 414 compared to the prior reporting period. Bank balances, again, are largely to account for that across the group of about R544 million, slightly offset by a loss in intercompany of about R130 million.</p>
          <p>The tax number, which we looked at earlier, the effective tax rate that has been reported for the half year, 36.95%. We talked about the STC. That hopefully will wash out from April 2012. Withholding taxes have increased by about 46% year-on-year, mainly due to the dividend related to the first tranche of the tower sale in Ghana. We upstreamed about $100 million related to that part of the sale. We had CGT of about 15% on that which we had to account for as well, which drove up that cost, included in the 36.95%.</p>
          <p>What's also interesting, though, is if you take all the tax rates &#x2013; effective tax rates of the opcos in the group, more than 50% of the group's PBT is tax rates of 33% and higher. So, to try and actually manage this number down into the high 20s, I think, is relatively impossible, I would say.</p>
          <p>We also have a pretty strong focus on cash upstreaming. You know the more we upstream cash across the group, the higher the impact will be on the withholding tax charges as we go forward. So, that's likely to endure. We also see pretty unreasonable, I think, demands from tax authorities across the group. So, we have a constant battle in terms of managing that exposure, but we have a good team that looks after us and keeps us honest in that part of the business.</p>
          <p>HEPS, overall, have increased by about 10%, R4.73 to R4.32. And accounting for the change on the reversal of the put option, about R0.038 negative impact, it comes down to R4.70, which is about a 7% half year to half year increase between 2010 and 2011. I should just probably note that the R0.344 profit on disposal of non-current assets is largely comprised of the tower cost sale for Ghana.</p>
          <p>Looking at the net debt slide, what we've shown here, including gross cash, which I'll talk about in the next few slides, is investments which have been made in short-term or quasi-cash type instruments of about R7 billion. But the overall gross cash position of the group has improved to R40.8 billion where net gross debt is about R30 billion, realizing a net debt, which is a net cash position for the group, of about R9.9 billion.</p>
          <p>The repayment schedule has been nicely smothered out. The last time we showed you this chart, it had some very uneven peaks and troughs, but that looks a whole lot better in terms of our cash flow profile in terms of meeting these obligations as we go forward. We also had the Fitch short-term credit rating up to F1+ which we had put out on a SENS announcement earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>We've dealt with most of the items on the income statement. The only item that is probably worthy of note, a very small number of R14 million negative, it includes two items. It is our share of the associate income of the Ghana Tower Co., which is mostly cost-driven at the end of the first six months, as well as the BICS transaction which we reported to you previously. So, profits from the sale of the BICS transaction, loss at this stage from the Ghana Tower Co. which is mostly set-up costs for the tower co., and that accounts for the R14 million. All the other numbers, I think, we have dealt with in the presentation up to now.</p>
          <p>The rand, again, looking at the balance sheet, exchange rate has moved from R6.61 at December to about R6.76 now, which is about a 2.2% swing, so not a major impact in terms of the closing position relative to December 2010. So, you will see property, plant and equipment has remained roughly flat, driven mostly by FX as well as a lower spend on CapEx.</p>
          <p>Goodwill and other intangible assets has tweaked up slightly, and that's mostly forex driven in our three underlying subsidiaries. The other current assets marked with an asterisk includes the, what we call, short-term cash or quasi-cash. We have an agreement with the auditors to disclose it accordingly. About R190 million in bonds in Iran, R6 billion in treasury bills in Nigeria and about R1 billion in foreign currency deposits in Nigeria as well.</p>
          <p>Overall then, as I mentioned earlier, about R9.8 billion net cash; and looking at the net debt/EBITDA, negative 0.39. Cash generated by ops, R23.6 billion for the first six months compared to R24 billion, a slightly lower number. There is, of course, some FX impact in that, but a key feature of that really is we had a negative swing on working capital of about R1.2 billion. So, clearly, there is some work to do on the working capital side. In the prior comparative period, we had a positive of about R150 million.</p>
          <p>Looking down the line, the number to really unpack is the other investing activities, R6.7 billion. That's a fairly large number and it includes a bunch of items. The biggest item in there, of course, is the R7.2 billion which I've just mentioned earlier, which is investments in the foreign currency deposits, the treasury bills as well as the bonds in Nigeria and Iran.</p>
          <p>But other items included in there are repayments of the Iran loans of about R887 million. There is the income from the Ghana Tower Co. transaction of R445 million and a whole bunch of bits and pieces, which I will not endure with you with.</p>
          <p>So, overall, strong cash flow generation as we mentioned on slide one. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nazir. Looking forward and starting off with the strategic considerations, clearly, a key issue of our strategies looking forward is leveraging revenue and cost optimization opportunities. We intend to continue to support the ICT convergence and we intend to play a leading role especially in our larger market. And we continue to focus on leadership and market share in all the markets as indicated earlier.</p>
          <p>From a rollout point of view, it's important that we increase the pace of our network rollout. I think the issues that we've had to deal with in the first half are now reasonably well under control. And also upgrading and optimizing the networks to ensure the quality of the network in order to increase the expected demand &#x2013; expected increased demands in some of our markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of shareholder returns, as you have seen, the dividend payout ratio policy has been increased to 65% and we will continue to investigate options to improve returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>In terms of subscriber guidelines, just one or two changes. Ghana, from the previous guideline that we'd given. Ghana, we've taken up to 1.3 million subscribers. And then in terms of the rest of the operations excluding the ones that are listed, we've put that at 7.7 million, giving a guidance of just about 20.1 million subscribers for the year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. That is the end of the formal presentation. We will now take questions. I do have a number of my colleagues that are here to help, so we should be able to address all the questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Sifiso. It's Jonathan Kennedy-Good here from SBG Securities. Thanks very much for your increased dividend payout ratio. It's most welcome. I was just looking at your cash balances still building and it looks like that's going to continue and you mentioned investigating options to improve shareholder returns. Has the Board discussed a potential share buyback or special dividend? And if so, which one would you prefer?</p>
          <p>And then just on an operational issue in Nigeria, you mentioned that tariffs may decline or have declined already in response to competitor offerings. How do you protect the existing revenue base within the Nigerian group? Are you able to segmentalize or compartmentalize your subscribers in terms of what tariffs they get charged or should we expect significant slowing in Nigerian voice revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the first one. The issue is that the Board is taking all possible options into consideration. We haven't really made any &#x2013; or let's say, no specific decision has been made. All options are open. And at this stage, it's not a question of whether there is any preference. I guess the Board will continue to discuss this. And once we have come to a conclusion, you will be &#x2013; it will be communicated accordingly. So, all the options are looked at. And the key issue is that we do believe in making sure that we do return cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>On Nigeria, the reality is that the competition over the first six months from a pricing point of view has increased quite aggressively. I think the key issue there is the fact that we had remained at quite a significant premium and that did start impacting our acquisition and also our traffic &#x2013; the traffic on our network. So, the issue is that we've had to adjust our pricing. We did adjust it in February, but we have recently also adjusted our pricing.</p>
          <p>I guess the key issue is also the fact that we believe that there's still a significant amount of elasticity in that market. So, with the prices coming down, we expect that there will be additional capacity requirements. And whilst the elasticity is probably not higher than 1, we believe it's definitely higher than 0.5. So, we believe that there still is good revenue growth opportunities despite the reduction we expect to go through in pricing. We have &#x2013; at some stage, I guess, we were at premiums of up to about 60%, and I guess it's difficult to sustain such levels of premium.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Johan Snyman, Renaissance Capital. Sifiso, the slowdown in CapEx, just to give us a little bit more color, was that vendors, was it later implementation on your side or was that in response to maybe competitors that also slowed down their rollout in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a problem as far as logistics was concerned. I think we did mention at the last presentation that one of our main suppliers did have problems as far as their logistics processes. They moved warehouses and that caused some problems. Unfortunately, that problem continued into the early part of this year, so we did have delays in receiving equipment.</p>
          <p>Then we also had some delays as a direct result of our own internal processes in which we've continued to review some of the CapEx spend into early this year. And then in one or two cases, there were delays that were as a direct result of customs in that particular country.</p>
          <p>I think that hand was up first. Anyway, carry on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. John Slettevold from UBS. Just a question really regarding the data competitiveness in South Africa where you're growing revenue at 17% relative to competitors where their numbers are well above that. What is affecting that and are you planning on any specific action in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The issue is there from a capacity point of view. In South Africa, our overall network capacity has not been as high as our &#x2013; as one of our competitors. If you recall, some years back, we were, let's say, a bit slow in growing our 3G network. But we now clearly have a strategy in which from a capacity point of view, we do intend to get to be on par as far as network capacity is concerned. The other question was the growth in revenue. I don't know, Karel, do you have a comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just talk loudly. You're quite right. For the first part of this year, we were not competitive in the market price-wise. If I look at the growth in June and July, relative to the previous year's June and July, it sits at 40% growth to-date. So, it's certainly a big catch-up. So, it is mainly price related in the more dongle space. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Peter from RMB Morgan Stanley. Just two questions focusing on Nigeria. The first one, the SIM registration deadline coming up in September, do you expect there to be an extension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Likely. Okay. Because at about 50% sort of base registered, I thought that would be a risk. But anyway, thank you. Then, Nazir, how should we think about margins in Nigeria given changes in the traffic patterns as you've just talked about versus the cost reduction programs that you are working on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we've been fairly consistent in that &#x2013; in our response for that question. I think just the degree of the downside impact, I think, has changed in terms of the way we've explained it over the last few years. We've always said that to endure margins at 63% or above 60% in the long term was going to be an impossible challenge.</p>
          <p>So, we expect margins over time in Nigeria and the question is over how long to come down to about the mid-50s level. I think what's important as a result of that is what we're doing in terms of cost optimization programs to offset the potential EBITDA impact of the lower margin. That's one thing.</p>
          <p>The other thing is to really focus &#x2013; the other important part of the strategy to focus the local team in terms of continuing to grow nominal EBITDA and nominal revenue. The problem really arises when traffic, I guess, has declined to such an extent that you see your revenue in local currency going backwards and you haven't done anything about managing your cost base. So, far, I think we've been able to demonstrate that all the cost optimization initiatives we've launched has been, say, accretive in terms of keeping at least our EBITDA growth positive year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The other opportunity we have in front of us is to the extent that we are successful in deploying these hybrid power solutions, it has a massive impact in terms of managing the energy bill in Nigeria. At 3.6%, if you take off 25% of that bill, you take a lot of heat out of the tariff decline pressures that you're facing.</p>

          <p>No. Yeah, you know what, Sifiso mentioned earlier &#x2013; sorry, Sifiso, do you want me to take this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>What Sifiso mentioned earlier is we were kind of out of the market for a good few months. The thing that drove our competitiveness in late Q1 and early Q2 &#x2013; very early Q2 was the Magic Number promo because the customers responded very, very positively to it. Q2 was a bit muddled as well in terms of the first washing machine effect, if I could call it, or subscribers' registration.</p>
          <p>We've seen the same impact in both South Africa as well as Ghana. So, we don't expect to see anything different. Although the regulator put out a 30-day disconnection rule for non-compliance with the documentation requirements, all subscribers are still following a 90-day rule in terms of disconnections. The first level of those disconnections took place in May. Right?</p>
          <p>But the more important thing is if you go back and look at what happened in the second quarter, you had Etisalat get very, very competitive in the month of May despite the new value propositions they launched late last year. They came in with a lot of new freebies. Things like recharges of NGN300 for a NGN200 &#x2013; that means, bonus recharges of NGN300 for the NGN200 recharge offer, a lot of use-as-you-want based on a subscription entry on a daily basis, use it for SMS, use it for data, use it for whatever.</p>
          <p>So, when you look at the way they've actually put these in the market and the way they've communicated them, in addition to an effective NGN12 tariff in the market, they've had the most effective value proposition.</p>
          <p>Now, by all accounts, what Sifiso talked about is our blended pricing in the market was 60%. On-net &#x2013; on peak, probably as high as 120% above anyone else in the market. You cannot be competitive. It had the effect of slowing down our growth and our share of customer acquisitions.</p>
          <p>What we think will happen now as we go forward based on early indications of the new value proposition we've launched is we will become more competitive. We will get our share of net adds up. So, we expect to see, without giving you any forecasts, an improvement at least on the rate of which we've been growing revenue, but no worse than what we've seen in the first half.</p>
