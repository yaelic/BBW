          <p>Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Bradesco's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Let me now transfer the floor to Mr. Milton Vargas for his opening remarks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to our conference call. The first quarter of 2008 was marked by strong international turbulence in the market, derived by the subprime crisis. International players had to recognize a heavy loss in the amount of $240 billion. In our opinion, the affects of this turmoil will take some more time to be dissipated, especially the United States. But we believe that the balance in shift of global banks will begin to show some improvement in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>It's important to notice that the timely interventions of this debt in the US treasury has mitigated substantially as well as further and more seriously problems in major financial institutions. In addition, China and other emerging markets which are growing at a much faster pace than the developed economies are promoting the impact of the banking crisis on the global economy.</p>
          <p>In this context, Brazil is experiencing a strong demand for its export products, especially commodities, which already accounts for more than 60% of our exports. We can also assure that the foreign crisis have had very little impact on the Brazilian economy, which continues to show signs of the strong vitality. Prior to these estimates, in family consumptions are growing strongly and more consistently than in the past.</p>
          <p>All in the all, we expect the GDP growth of around 4.8% a year vis-&#xE0;-vis 5.4% in 2007. The exchange rate should remain close to R$1.75 at the year end, which we believe is compatible with an expected trading surplus of around $27 billion.</p>
          <p>Although the concerns of the Central Bank with inflation are correct, we believe the intervention will be temporary and different from the ones in 2004 and 2005. Therefore, we continue to expect annual inflation lower than 5%.</p>
          <p>The base rate <mark type="inaudible" /> is likely to increase further before end of the year. It's ending at the 13%, although through research we conduct with companies there should be a little impact on their will continue to invest. We believe corporate loans will continue to expand with low delinquencies, while growth in the volume of individual loans should slow down marginally.</p>
          <p>The creation of the new jobs remains strong being an additional guarantees against future delinquencies. According to our estimates, this year total trade in Brazil should increased by 22% vis-&#xE0;-vis 28% in 2007. Relative to this scenario, Bradesco will report the net income of more than R$2.1 billion in the first quarter, a 23.3% jump in our year-over-year's analysis.</p>
          <p>The stockholders exceeded R$32.9 billion, a 26.4% year-over-year growth. The efficiency rate accumulate over 12 months was included, raising 41.7% vis-&#xE0;-vis 42.1 in March 2007. In our analysis the total stockholders assets reached 32% in this quarter. On the operational front, insurance, pension plans, and saving bonds contributed with R$746 million representing 35% of Bradesco's net income.</p>
          <p>Premiums reached R$5.4 billion equivalent to our market share of 24.1% according to the last available date. Our combined ratio of 83.9 reflected our performance, comparable to the best insurance companies in the world. Bradesco's loan portfolio grew by 37% over the last 12 months, and by 59% in the first quarter, higher than the market as a whole according to the listed date.</p>
          <p>If we include sureties guarantees in credit card receivables, the loan portfolio surpassed R$169 billion, 5% higher then in the last quarter and 38.5% higher than the last 12 months. Its strong growth was backed by better asset quality as the way to still rate the operations represented 93.4% of our book, vis-&#xE0;-vis 92.2% in March 2007. We are continuing to foster our credit card operations, turning it more competitive commercially in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>Summarizing, we are proceeding in three ways. One; through the mix of products for high and low income individual and corporate user, with the combination of the three leading brands, Visa, American Express and Master Card. Two; by consolidating distribution for checking and no checking account holder and three; by integrating Bradesco's card areas resulting synergies in revenue, expenses and the best prices. This process will be boosted by the creation of the new Bradesco subsidiary fully dedicated to managing this business.</p>
          <p>In mortgages, we would like -- we would particularly like to highlight our quarterly origination of R$1.5 billion in operations, a massive 126.3 percentage jump vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter of 2007. Just in the first three months of 2008 we provided financing for more than 13,000 homes, representing a 27.8% margin share. We continue to force the operation outlook to agriculture, and we had recently launched a specific website which contains the addressed to the needs of this sector.</p>
          <p>Our investment bank also did a very good job. In the first quarter, we reached leadership in Latin America for financial advisory in M&amp;A, lower than $500 million. We were also leveraging operation of fixed income. Overall, our investment bank was ranked as the best financial advisor with R$2 billion in deal. The <mark type="inaudible" /> with R$2.8 billion in operation and we closed 2007 ranked first in project finance. Banking on international brokerage, Bradesco acquired Agora Corretora, the leader of the Brazilian sales segment with 29,000 active clients.</p>
          <p>In asset management, we surpassed R$183 billion under management and in March, Bradesco was elected the best manager in equity for exchange in long short fund by the Vesta Invested Magazine. Speaking to meet investor growing interest in averages, we launched two firms focused on company listed in the public by Corporate Governor's Index.</p>
          <p>Interest financing and foreign exchange operation, it is worth to mention our market shares of 21.1% in export and 15.2% in import. Together with this performance, Bradesco financing just in this quarter, Brazil has exported in a volume of $4.1 billion and imported in a volume of $516 million. Over the last twelve months, export and import financing jumped by 53.2 and 52.7%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Regarding IT, we are in the final stage of upgrading our hardware, software and basic communication network with the most modern technologies. This massive operation will benefit branch and customer service points as well as our more than 36 million customers. In the early hours of Sunday, April 20, we migrated all the client service systems which account for 60% of Bradesco processing operations to our new information technology site.</p>
          <p>Risk management is considered our top priority probably due to the gradual increasing complexity of the financial market. We undertook a remarkable step with the consolidation of the structure of governance which comes now with four executive committees and four statutory committees, in addition to an independent structure, focusing exclusively on risk management and internal compliance activity. The risk management process comprehends <mark type="inaudible" /> which involves identification, analysis, and litigation for use. Property controllers and monetary by default to stands regularly to this senior management.</p>
          <p>The compliance with the Basel II requirement is in advanced stage. And we believe that we should not have any problems to attain to the Brazilian Central Bank agenda deadline. In terms of sustainability and in line with Bradesco Banco of the plan to campaign, we would like to highlight some initiatives in the first quarter here. One, the creation of two specific products that will generate revenues per day: Fundacao <mark type="inaudible" /> our foundation Bradesco is the co-founder which is focused to preserve the rain forests in the state of Amazon. Two, to the partnership of Bradesco has with Fundacao, SOS <mark type="inaudible" />. Our forest seedling production center was inaugurated in the feature of Pieracci CABA in the interior of that state of Sao Paulo. And three, success of the Bradesco volunteer program partner, which became the biggest corporate volunteer internet network in Brazil. And four, the release of our 2007 sustainability report, which contains the annual summary of Bradesco's initiative and activities incorporate social responsibilities complying with the third version of the global reporting initiative.</p>
          <p>All-in-all and in our understanding, Brazil did a good job in the first quarter of this year, given the strategic and therefore the strong volatility in the market. We remain optimistic regarding 2008 and the prospective for Brazil as a whole. In fact, Brazil deserves to receive the longer wait in investment ready status at to the end of this year. As a result of this scenario, we are strongly investing the expansion of our distributions in IT and its best training. We believe that all this process will benefit our future results.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we expect to extend our checking account basis by further 1.7 million clients and we will step up the integration of our various segments in associates companies. In this context, we had taking in IT taking important measures to integrate our data basis with our front office operation. Nevertheless, competition in the banking sector is becoming tougher year-after-year implying pressure on its present fees. But this will benefit some important competitive advantages in this operations in client bases. We aim to maximize in all of the dues and in this context we would like to highlight a very important factor, the quality and education of our employees. This raise Bradesco reach and substantially challenge its goals. As a result, we had a much lower turnover of that than the market. Not be surprised that the fact -- the fact that Bradesco is usually considered as one of the best companies to work for.</p>
          <p>We could summarize saying the all strategic approach takes into account unexpected growth in the Brazilian economy over the coming years with increasing demand of banking insurance product translates in the very attractive domestic market. Bradesco leadership in quality of first IT to make us benefit of this process, this is a reason why I'm not forgetting about the quality of the present results. We had focused on effective actions to boost future earnings and increase our market shares.</p>
          <p>Thank you for you attention and after Jean's presentation, we will be available to answer any further questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Slide number one. Initially and before commenting our performance, it is worth to mention that there would be two important changes in the fiscal and corporate legislation which could impact the coming period.</p>
          <p>On the fiscal side, the increase of financial institutions of the social contribution moving from 9 to 15% still pending on the approval of the provisional measure number 413 by the Congress could impact the banking sector from May on.</p>
          <p>The impact on the measures introduced by the Law number 11638 which changes the Accounting Principles in Brazil putting them more in line with the IFRS depends also on complimentary rules to be issued by the Brazilian Central Bank and by the CVM which is the equivalent to the Brazilian SEC which are likely to be approved in the next coming month.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number two, as one can see, we are including in this slide Bradesco's main drivers at previously highlighted by Milton in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Slide, number three, Bradesco reported a R$2.1 billion net income in 23.2% evolution vis-&#xE0;-vis the same period of 2007 equivalent to approximately $1.2 billion. The non-recurring events that affected the net income in this quarter as well as in the comparative period are listed here as one can see.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008, has already disclosed to the market, we recorded a gain of R$352 million rise from the partial sales of our stake in Visa International and amortized the Medi service goodwill in the amount of R$53 million.</p>
          <p>As of yesterday, our remaining stake at Visa International was worse R$464 million. As a result, our adjusted net income surpassed R$1.9 billion in the first three months of 2008. We would like to inform that other operating expenses increased in this quarter because of approximately R$86 million expenses which are not expected to be repeated going forward. These expenses are composed by one, R$56 million provision for fee, we used to charge customers when and if they prepaid their loans. And two R$30 million provision for that target. Therefore the recurring net results of operating revenues and expenses could be ranging around R$900 million.</p>
          <p>Please note that all the comparatives analysis and ratios used in this presentation in the press release and in the fact book take into consideration the net income adjusted by non-recurring event. This is the way we will be from now on analyzing Bradesco performance.</p>
          <p>Slide number four. We can see in this slide the evolution of EPS, the cost to income ratio and net income on a quarterly basis. We have no EPS evolved by 10.6% over the last 12 months closing at R$2.41. Efficiency improved as our cost to income ratio moved from 42.1 by the end of March 2007 to the actual 41.7%. We believe the efficiency ratio will remain stable over the next two to three years due to the expansion in distribution, client base and IT investment focused on the replacement and renewal of Bradesco whole IT architecture. After that we are confident that the efficiency ratio will improve even further.</p>
          <p>Slide number five. Bradesco reached total assets of R$355.5 billion, 26.1% higher than in March 2007. The revolution was mainly due to the R$38 billion jump in the long portfolio and R$17 billion increase in interim bank investments. Considering the adjusted net income, analyzed return on average stockholders' equity stood at 28.7%, while the return on average assets stood at 2.2%. Standing at 13.9%, the capital adequacy ratio is almost 300 basis points higher than the minimum requirement allotted by the Brazilian Central Bank, which is 11%.</p>
          <p>In a simulation with the figures of March 2008, should we adopt the terms of the Central Bank's circular number 3367 relative of hedge of investments in abroad, which could not be included in the BIS ratio calculation, Bradesco's ratio would be standing at 16.7%, 12.6% of which in tier 1. In this case, it would allow Bradesco to increase its loan book by approximately R$130 billion. By the way, simulation under the expected Basel II rules to be implemented in the second half of 2008, give us confidence of Bradesco's operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Slide number 6. Bradesco's unrealized gains reached R$4.1 billion in March 2008. The quarterly decline is basically driven by the higher volatility which affected the mark-to-market of available for sales and health maturity securities, as well as the stocks Bradesco still holds at BM&amp;F and Bovespa. Once again, it is important to remember that these figures do not include our participation in not publicly-traded companies such as SERASA and VISANET.</p>
          <p>Slide number 7. On this slide, we present Bradesco's net income breakdown. In the quarter, the relative participation of insurance increased strongly. Thanks to the reduced claims and better steels ratios and the return of technical provisions for individual health, insurance plans to normal levels. The higher decrease on services was due to the impact in changes in individual's checking account fees which were expected and incorporated in our guidance since disclosing our first quarter 2007 earnings.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight. This slide contains a summary of our income statement showing the main variations in the results. I would like to draw your attention to the positive variation in the insurance operations due to factors already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine. The strong increase of 38.5% of loans over the last 12 months was fundamental to boost the net interest income. The year-over-year adjusted net interest income evolved by 20.5% or by more than R$1 billion in nominal terms. We highlight the interest bearing asset which increased in volume offsetting the impact of lower strengths. We would like to add that the non-interest income line of the last quarter of 2007 was one of the highest of the last three years.</p>
          <p>On the top of that, it was impacted by R$56 million of recoveries of loans, which happened every year in the last quarter. This quarter is more in line with Bradesco <mark type="inaudible" /> average.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10. On this slide we present the nominal valuation of net interest margin and net interest income only of the interest bearing assets. As one can see we experienced the 20.4% year-over-year evolution in the net interest income despite of the decline in the base rate depicted in the blue line. In our understanding it is key to verify this performance in order to better predict the trends for the coming quarters. Information included in this slides do not take into consideration neither trading gains and potential these investments gains, nor the effect of mark-to-market.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11. This slide gives a breakdown of the adjusted net interest income. As you can see loan operations has been increasing their relative participation quarter-after-quarter. The drop in the participation in the margin of funding and insurance in the period was due to the reduction in the average base rate which moved from 12.8 to 11.3%.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12. This slide gives a summary of the financial margin gain in loans. The blue line depict the performance of the gross gains deducted by the cost of opportunity. The red line shows the evolution of the allowance for loan losses net of recoveries. At one can see from the behavior of the blue line the increase volume of loans has been keen to offset the impact of lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>And the line in the middle is concerned the net margin has been recording consistent nominal growth climbing by 17.4% comparing the first quarters of 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide number 13. Bradesco's total loan portfolio, including sureties and guarantees and receivables of credit cards stood at R$169 billion by the end of March, 5% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2007, and 38.5% higher than in March of last year. When we analyzed the loan portfolios breakdown by segment, we noticed a balanced growth between all the business segments, SMEs individuals, and large corporate.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14 and 15. In this slide one can see the breakdown of the main credit line for companies and individuals. Beginning with the corporate segment, we would like to highlight the growth of the following credit line.</p>
          <p>Leasing, working capital and mortgage. It is worth noticing the sound performance of sureties and guarantees, especially in the large corporate segment, which recorded a 58% year-over-year growth. As for individuals, the credit line of leasing mainly focused on new cars, agriculture based on the growth in the factor and mortgage expanded the most. It is worth to mention that, if you exclude sureties and guarantees the individual loan portfolio already represents 23% of the total book.</p>
          <p>Slide number 16. This slide shows the lack of provisioning coverage vis-&#xE0;-vis the lack of expected loss. As one can see, we have the R$1.2 billion access of provisions based on the requirement of the Brazilian Central Bank represented by the difference between the lines in red and grey.</p>
          <p>And if one compares our total provision to the expected losses for the next twelve months depicted in the lines gray and green, Bradesco's actual excessive provisions stand at a very comfortable level of R$2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide number 17. As we have already mentioned in our fact book, the calculations criteria of no more than 90 days fact too has been improved. Up to last quarter, we were using the right criteria of the Brazilian Central Bank for past-due operations which obliges for no more than 36 months operation should double count the period for the means of the establishment of rating criteria for past-due operations. This means that long term operations were included in the 90 days past-due ratios only after a 180 day.</p>
          <p>It is important to emphasize that this improvement in calculation did not change the needs of provision. After this comment and after adjusting to the previous periods, we cannot serve that no more than 90 days delinquency ratio for individuals standing flat at 6.4%. The delinquency ratio for SMEs has been declining and is now standing at one of its lowest levels over the last two years. Finally, we expect a slight improvement in delinquency in 2008 for all the segments.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18. Regarding payroll deductible loans, we can see that Bradeco's own origination grew by 78.1% over the last twelve months and by 6.3% vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous quarter. The acquisition of BMC and integration of payroll deductible loans with Bradesco's branch network should enhance the origination even more. Our estimate fund out to a close to 100% increase in this best portfolio emerging year of 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide number 19. Despite out of finance, credit cards and payroll deductible loans the expected prospective for mortgage are also very positive for the coming years. Last year Bradesco originated R$4 billion of mortgage financing the acquisition of approximately 30,000 properties representing a 22% market share. For 2008 our target of origination stands at R$5.3 billion and we have no doubt to meet this goal because we already originated more than R$1.5 billion in the first quarter financing more than 13,000 properties representing a 27% market share allowing Bradesco to maintain its leadership amongst private bank.</p>
          <p>Slide number 20. As one can see fees increased 9.5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by asset management, cards and loan operation fees. The slight decline in the quarter was mainly due to the restructuring of fees to individuals, smaller number of capital markets deals and high number of credit and debit card transactions which seasonally happened at the end of every year.</p>
          <p>Slide number 21. In comparison with the previous quarter, we can see a reduction in the expenses mainly due to seasonal reasons. In the year-over-year comparison, the structural personnel expenses grew by 10.9% due to one: the annual negotiation for wage increase; two, the incorporation of BMC; and three, the expansion in distribution. Increase in administrative expenses is derived by one: organic growth: two, increase in volumes of transactions; three, readjustments in prices of procurement contract; and four, more investments in IT. It is worth to highlight that we still continue to be focused on cost control and on maximizing operational efficiency, despite the increase in CapEx and enhanced machine quality.</p>
          <p>Slide number 22. The coverage ratio obtained by comparing fees and operating expenses got slightly worse, due to the process of restructuring of fees for the reasons we already mentioned before. Considering that the coverage ratio is accumulated in 12 months, its improvement, thanks to the sales only after this period. However, we count on the growth in volume of operations and client base to try to improve the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Slide number 23. In this slide one can see the evolution of our funding, with outstanding performance in demand and savings deposits which climbed by 29% and 21% respectively over the last 12 months. The decline in demand deposit in the quarter was already expected, because of the effect of the end of the CTMS tax which artificially increased the demand deposits by the end of 2007. The strong expansions in time deposits is explained by the need of funding for loan booked growth and the consequence of the legal measure which access reserve requirements upto 25% on the funding derived by leasing company. In the asset management segment, Apache's were the best performer, growing by 10% in the quarter and by 163% over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide number 24. In order to provide a better understanding of our insurance, pension plan and savings bonds operations, we are presenting a summary of our insurance group income statement on this slide. In the quarter, net income from these operations grew by 28% or by 41% over the last 12 months, reaching R$746 million compared to R$529 million in the first quarter 2007. With annualized -- and annualized return on equity of around 38%.</p>
          <p>Based on February 2008 data, this bottom line represented a 45% market share. The significant increase in net income in the quarter, is explained by one: the improvement of the claims ratio and consequently of the combined ratio, as well as by two: the conclusion of the process of building individual health insurance provision.</p>
          <p>Slide number 25. Revenues from insurance premiums, pension plan and savings bonds totaled R$5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2008, a 11.8% year-over-year growth equivalent to a 24% market share as of February 2008 available data. As a result, Bradesco remained leader in the pension plan property and life insurance segment.</p>
          <p>Slide number 26 and 27. Guaranteeing assets of technical reserves reached R$68 billion equivalent to a 33.6% market share. It is worth remembering that 79% of these assets correspond to the pension plan and which should be owned referenced portfolios. Total assets grew by 18% year-over-year. Technical provisions totaled 59.7% R$59.7 billion or a 35.1% market share as of February 2008.</p>
          <p>We would like to draw your attention to the volume of technical provisions in the health segment, which amounted to around R$3.3 billion, R$1.4 billion of which built over the last five quarters. By the way, as for Bradesco's health provisions, I would also like to point out that if we maintain current market conditions, especially regarding the levels claimed and the capacity of premiums being readjusted in line with the increase in the medical inflation, that we believe our health provisions to be appropriate to the needs we identified in our assumptions.</p>
          <p>Slide number 28. As you can see on this slide, personnel and administrative expenses remain virtually flat.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, the combined ratio measures the re-operation of efficiency of the insurance group regarding claims control, and if the underwriting policy is correct. We would like to highlight the improvement in this ratio over the last twelve months.</p>
          <p>Slide number 30. We maintain Bradesco's guidance for 2008 and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the loan portfolio's guidance, which is broken down by segment and product. I would also like to point out that the expected increase in operational expenses that you can see on this slide is divided by Bradesco's plans to expand distribution.</p>
          <p>Slide number 31. We are here inviting each and every one for Bradesco's day -- investor day in London, which will take place next month.</p>
          <p>Slide number 32. Here you can see our economic forecast for 2008 and 2009, regarding GDP, base rate, inflation and FX rate. The highlight here is the interest rate outlook, which is expected to reach 13% up to the end of this year.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, first, I would like to emphasize the words said by our CFO, Mr. Milton, concerning the efforts Bradesco is undertaking to maximize recurring net income along with a strategy of expansion in distribution and client base. We are proceeding strong investments in human resources and IT, which will benefit our future results. And two, last but not least, although we faced high volatility in the international financial system in this quarter, which generated high uncertainty, Bradesco's senior management considers that the results we presented yesterday are very good and characterized by very high quality.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And let us move to the question and answer session. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning everyone. Quick question, your guidance for net interest income for 2008 of growth of 16 to 20%, is that different from what you had in the previous quarter? I am sorry, I don't have the previous presentation in handy but you know, I am assuming that with the expectation of higher interest rate that number should be more positive for you. Was that number revised up and what's your view about the likelihood of open distribution of that number given that the Central Bank now is on a hiking mode? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jorge. Actually the guidance used is the very same we presented last quarter. Obviously the first quarter is not always the best measure because it's in theory a weaker quarter than the other ones. And we are going to continue to verify if there is a need in the future for changing the guidance. But up to now we will maintain a positive and about this guidance we are providing you. But it's exactly the same guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So and if I may just a follow up, was it guidance in the previous quarter already contemplating that the Central Bank was going to hike interest rates or this a no event and this number potentially has some up side potential also to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it was not contemplating the increase in the interest rates, because when we disclosed the numbers it was on January 28. And if you remember, when we gave the forecast, the outlook for the economy it was a little bit different. In general terms what happens is that, we feel comfortable with this guidance, but sometimes depending on what happens, for example interest rates moving up, you could continue to be in the same range, but being closer to the upper range than to the lower range. But up to now, we continued to hope to believe in this guidance.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Moline with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone. My question is related to the let's say the sensitivity of Bradesco's balance sheet to interest rates. And without looking forward, but actually looking at where we stand at the end of the &#x2013; where we stood at the end of the first quarter 2008, can you help us understand the -- let's say the asset sensitivity or the net sensitivity of Bradesco to 100 basis point increase in interest rates, if we look at where we are today all else equal? Are your assets -- are your assets reprising faster than your liabilities and therefore a rising interest rate environment assuming all else equal would actually produce higher earnings for Bradesco or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jason. Actually maintaining everything equal, so supposing that there is no change in the longer growth and theoretically speaking we would say that Bradesco has a free fund and working capital in the amount of approximately R$35 billion. By saying that actually for every 1% increase or decline in the rate, you have an impact of a gross effect of approximately R$350 million, after taxes going down to around R$200 million. So theoretically speaking if everything is equal, the sensitivity analysis is around this range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I mean, but should we also consider, I mean, that's what's free today. And I understand, or that's the impact now. But should we think about -- how do we think about the assets re-pricing going forward, right? We have assets re-pricing and liabilities re-pricing going forward and you've been growing longer duration assets, payroll loans, mortgages, auto loans. Can you help us understand, is this -- I mean theoretically Bradesco should be less asset sensitive today than it was two years ago. Is there a way to quantify that? I mean how -- what's the average duration of the loan book today versus what it was a year or two ago, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look. You have in effect in the footnote of Bradesco, which is closed exactly the tender of assets and liability. And actually as you can see they are roughly similar in terms of periods. We always are analyzing what is going on in the market, if we re-price, if the interest rates we charge are correct. But I would say, over the last one or two years, there was no huge increase in the average tenure of the loan book. Actually, although some credit lines like mortgage are growing very fast, this still represents a very small participation vis-&#xE0;-vis the overall book of Bradesco.</p>
          <p>So theoretically speaking, although the treasury is always analyzing what is going on in the market, it has been doing actually a very good job, if you analyze the performance of the non-interest income part of the net interest income, you can see that actually we are always analyzing what is going in the market. Nothing is changing dramatically over the last maybe one or two years. The tenures are expanding but naturally, and you have in the footnotes, we disclose assets and liabilities. So in general terms, we are always looking but it's difficult to give a precise answer for that question.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. If I strip out the health insurance earnings where you obviously benefited from the absence of additional provisions, your earnings were down 3% quarter-over-quarter, they were only up 5% year-over-year. You were recurring earnings when I stripped that out. I know you mentioned that you thought it was a good quarter given the market volatility. But is this, I mean, is this number a bit disappointing to you, given the balance sheet growth that you had over the last year? And should we expect a more meaningful uptick in recurring earnings growth in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> speaking. Saul, related to the health, we are earning a lot of things in other line of business related to the health. Not only in the line of the health. So is the -- there are a lot of gross or sell between for instance in a dental, in the life. Most of business relates to the health are related to the pension plans and life also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I understand, my question really wasn't related to the performance of the insurance businesses which even normalizing for health seemed strong this quarter. My question was really about the other businesses. In other words, if you made 117 million in earnings this quarter in the health insurance business, you had virtually nothing in previous quarters. If I strip that out or normalize your consolidated recurring earnings this quarter and subtract out the health insurance earnings from that number, your earnings this quarter, recurring earnings for Bradesco as a whole fell 3%, they were only up 5% year-over-year. And I was just wondering how you view that kind of growth. Is it disappointing or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I'd like to mention to you that the technical reserve is of insurance, our insurance in business. Related to the lot of the assets related to the technical provision like ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fixed bonds, and the basically fixed bonds and the equities, market equities. In the last quarter what happened, as you know the performance of stock market would be very good and we took an opportunity to realize some gains at that time. But I can't promise to you, I can't project for sure the same performance of the stock market. The fact of the other reserves represents a very important amount related to infinity in the equities. But our returns, and you can see in the slide 25, after tax 27.8. I think is the highest in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No and I understand now the results in the insurance business were strong, my question is really for Milton and Jean. And it seems that given the very good earnings in the insurance business, it seems to me that the R$1.9 billion of recurring earnings for Bradesco as a whole, seem a little bit disappointing. If I strip out, like I said if I strip out health insurance earnings this quarter from total earnings for all of Bradesco, not just the insurance business, there were earnings, recurring earnings only grew 5% year-over-year. And I kind of wanted to get a better sense for how the company feels about that number and if it's really happy with the kind of earnings that they generated this quarter. Does that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually we in the presentation and Milton Vargas at the end of his opening remarks, he restated about the quality of the earnings and that we're happy to disclose these numbers in a period with much higher volatility, changes in legislation and every year the higher and growing competition. So at the end of the day you can consider that Bradesco senior management is happy.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have a question referring to the 2008 perspective on page 30 on the breakdown of the <mark type="inaudible" />. And it seems to me that the perspective for 2008 were very similar as to last year. And I was just wondering -- when I compare this projections for 2008 with quarterly growth rates and it was pretty interesting to see that some of these products are actually much lower growth rates. At same time Consignado payroll loans, which is expected to grow 90 to 110% grew 3.4% first quarter and 49% at last 12 months. So that suggests a very big jump over the rest of the year. At the same time leasing which is non-accrued grew 59% in the last quarter and how do you see this, the portfolio makes developing because it seems to be big variations between products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar I would say and we recommend always the analyst to compare the 12 months period. Although, you might be using the numbers of the quarter and projecting them for the year. Obviously, it's very difficult to annualize numbers that's usually the first quarter is the weakest in terms of economy and you live in Brazil. So I believe so actually you know that the economy is not so steady as it is maybe in other countries quarter-after-quarter. But at the end of the day, when you look at the numbers that we have for example, in terms of the net interest income, net interest income that we are projecting in a range of 16 to 20% is close to the one that we disclosed over the last 12 months. So again, you might not agree, but we strongly recommend people to analyze the 12 months numbers much more than just taking the quarter and projecting annually for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But still payroll loans that 12-months was 49% and the projections for 2008 are 90 to 110%. That is very big. It's almost double the current month's rates whereas understand the markets growth rate is reducing. So does that imply sound strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look the line -- we are not hearing 100%. Could you repeat 49% would be what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>49% is the 12-month growth rates for the payroll loans, consignados. That's a very &#x2013; a rate significantly level below the guidance for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look in the slide that we are disclosing the operation on slide number 18. Now I've got it, I was not hearing very well. 49% takes into account the whole portfolio. But as you can see we have been very dedicated to expand the operations of BMC and Bradesco together. And what we are giving of guidance is actually much more taking into account that the relative participation of acquired portfolio should be moving down and that can be the most important part of the growth will be, the own origination of Bradesco. So this is the reason why you should look more to the 78%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes. My main question is been asked already, but just one question if I may on asset quality. And also, what we've seen in terms of the trend in the quarter in terms of write-offs, charge-offs of loans. As I can see on a year-on-year basis and if you look back over the last four quarters, this number seems to have gone up quite a lot, I mean on a year-on-year basis it's gone up by about 35%. I mean do you expect it going forward to stay at these sorts of levels, shall we say a higher plane of charge-off or are there any kind of one-off items included in here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's actually the recurring number, but I would say that the best thing would be for you to try to analyze the slide number 16, where we are basically showing the evolution and obviously there are some times you should be looking at percentages, and sometimes it could be better to look at the evolution in numbers and the volume. You see the loan book growing very strongly, but we have a loan book of more than R$160 billion and the balance of provision stands close to 8 billion. But I would say recurring numbers but the best thing would be to look at the numbers we are showing on the slide number 16. As you can see the losses during 360 days compared with one year before are now standing close to 4.7%. And the understanding that we have is that this number should be moving down closer to the green line that you see, so moving from the 4.5 something percent closer to 4%. So in one year from now the level of losses should be closer to 4% than the 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 we are showing now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. My question is just about interest rates. It's -- from what level on interest rates and our rise in interest rates will start to affect loan demand and delinquencies especially. I think what's consensus now is that if rates, I mean, and that's what all the banks are saying &#x2013; if rates raise 200 bps from now, in a loan demand and delinquency will still be unchanged. So according to your sensitivities what is the level from when it starts to affect loan demand and again <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roberto, basically what we are seeing is an economy growing very strongly in Brazil, and affecting very positively individuals and companies. And there is a very huge pent up demand that we see for individuals in terms of buying cars, in terms of buying houses and white goods and others. When we look at the companies the level of leverage of the companies is also very low when you compare Brazil's level with levels of comparable economy. And so there is no specific percentage that we believe is going to affect. We believe that at the end of the day the economy is growing close to 5%, basically is something that would not affect the desire for growth. And there are two additional information that are importance to pass to you and would be the fundamentals if there is a sentiment that if you can buy, because installment fits inside of your salary and if you feel confident about your job that your job is not on the line. And we see the unemployment rates moving down and the level of wages moving up in Brazil, this affects positively individuals and on the side of the companies we have own researches from our chief economist team, Octavio Barros which analyses 1,600 companies and what happens if there is a change in the interest rates growing like 300 basis points and what we saw in this, through these research is that the companies should not be affecting their expectations of investments.</p>
          <p>So these two are the pillars of growth in loans over the coming years and we basically also have a very strong distribution, we have a huge client base more than 36.6 million customers that we should be benefiting, obviously more than anyone else.</p>

          <p>We saw first quarter, which was obviously much weaker than the last quarter of last year, but we are beginning to see a number of deals coming to the market. And obviously, the leadership that Milton mentioned in the beginning of the conference call will be key for Bradesco to grow. On the top of that, the customers that are making IPOs, they usually now are more of higher quality because of investors' flights to quality prospect. So we are seeing right now an increase in the number of deals, obviously not so high than what it was last year, but giving us good perspective for the year of 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. We have a question regarding your BIS ratio. The BIS ratio has declined from 15.7% a year ago to 13.9 at the end of the quarter, and you are projecting further declines on that ratio too, I think. So we would appreciate if you could let us know what your strategy is for managing the equity of the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alejandro. I would say, in general terms as you can see on the slide number 5, although there was a decline in the BIS ratio, we are not using the instrument that the Central Bank of Brazil would be allowing us to strip out of the calculation the hedged positions on the FX investments we have abroad, on the equity we have abroad, which actually would be helping us to raise from 13.9 to 16.7%. We are not using this prospect that we could use. It doesn't mean that we will. We feel that the 13.9% BIS ratio that we have is much higher than the 11% minimum ratio we have in Brazil. We also have a space to issue more Tier II, so you can issue up to 50% of what you have in Q1. So we could be using this way to boost even more the BIS ratio. But for getting above that, 13.9% gives us the possibility to expand our loan book by R$80 billion. And as we are expecting a loan book that you see growing, as you can see on slide number 30, in the range of 21 to 25, we have kept going up everything being equal to continue to expand our loan book for the next coming years without any problems. So the strategy should be roughly to use maybe the instrument of Tier II, but we definitely believe that the 13.9% BIS ratio is enough for Bradesco.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I just wanted to get back on to see just very quickly. One of the other reasons why you explain fees were down, was readjustment. And with the new regulations becoming effective, I think, it's coming up now on the 30th of April. Do you feel that readjustment is absolutely complete and we won't see further readjustments through the year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian, good afternoon. Actually these changes that are going to begin to affect banks from May on actually are not so easy for us to anticipate the movements during the year. For the guidance sake, we are using a fee income expectation of gross between 5 to 10%. From the calculations that we have up to now that already we have to certify over the coming quarters, because they are just calculations. We might have fees growing closer to 5% than growing closer to 10%. We are still looking at that. And in June, obviously, if we see that we could be or we should be changing the guidance, obviously we are going to do that. At last year you have to remember than we saw that a guidance could be -- should be changed, we also changed that. But we are always looking at ways to compensate fees. And we are still analyzing and we'll be analyzing very deeply what is going to occur from May on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If you don't mind, can I just ask a slightly different additional question? It's relating to the sort of the sensitivity of your aspects to rate increase. And particularly your security portfolio. An apology if this is already in the news, but what proportion of the security is a variable rate, and how quickly do you think that the security portfolio will reprise in line with the rate increase? But on top of that, how sensitive do you think your securities portfolio are to the mark-to-market hit from rate increases at the same time?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second. I don't have the precise information of the percentage, but I can guarantee that the bulk of the securities portfolio is invested in variable rates in Sydney. So if there is an increase in the interest rate, obviously you could have a positive impact translated in the income statement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just a follow-up here on operating expenses. And what I wanted to focus on was really you talked about investment in IT. I mean can you give us some idea of that -- those total operating expenses of 3.55 billion? I mean what percent of that is investment in IT? And can we expect that to tail off going forward into the year or has it yet to -- are you going to account for that pretty evenly over the course of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We invest roughly speaking $1 billion a year in IT and infrastructure. The IT improvement program, which is underway, it has approximately R$700 million of expenses that we should be undertaking over the next two to three years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you have account for 700 million over the next two to three years including this year?</p>

Obviously, the investor relations area is open for any further questions. Mr. Milton Vargas, Domingos Abreu always open to any difficulty that you have. Thank you very much for attending the first quarter earnings results. And see you, bye.</p>
