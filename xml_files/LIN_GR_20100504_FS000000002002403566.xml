          <p>Hello, and good morning, everybody, it's Thomas Eisenlohr. Thank you for joining the call for our Q1 results today. Georg Denoke, CFO, will be hosting the call and Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board, is also available for your questions. As we will also have our Annual General Meeting today we need to be strict on the timing for this call and have to finish 10 minutes before nine o'clock. We would therefore like to ask you to restrain yourself to one question in the first round of the Q&amp;A session in order to allow everyone to get through.</p>
          <p>I will now handover to Georg and we will open the line again for your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Georg Denoke. Good morning. I'll start my presentation with the highlights on page three. Based on the improving economic fundamentals around the world we have achieved a good start into the year and are now back on the growth track. Group sales increased by 7.4% to &#x20AC;2.894 billion. Group operating profit was up by 19.1% to &#x20AC;641 million.</p>
          <p>This growth reflects improving market conditions, positive currency effects and, as far as the over proportionate increase in the operation profit is concerned, further contributions from our High Performance Organization program. The Group's operating margin improved by 210 basis points to 22.1%. This operating performance has led to an EPS increase of 72.1%, to &#x20AC;1.17 on the reported basis. Taking into account the purchase price allocation the adjusted EPS rose by 42.4%, to &#x20AC;1.41. The operating cash flow achieved, with &#x20AC;397 million, almost the level of last year. We confirm our guidance for growth in Group sales and Group operation profit in 2010.</p>
          <p>Talking about the financial KPIs and business details now, I'll start with the breakdown of the Group sales on page four. Gases sales increased by 8.5% to &#x20AC;2.34 billion. As we will see in the Gases sales bridge later we had positive contributions from currency and natural gas price effects. On a comparable basis we recorded a solid growth of 3.9% for the start of the year. This underlying growth reflects the ongoing global economic recovery, with improving volumes being particularly visible in the Tonnage and Bulk product area.</p>
          <p>The Engineering business shows the usual pattern of a lower sales recognition in the first quarter. Sales of &#x20AC;517 million were 5.8% below last year's level. This development does not change our expectations to achieve full year sales at least on last year's level.</p>
          <p>On the order intake side we have recorded a positive momentum again with new order signings of &#x20AC;502 million. On page five you see that both divisions contributed to the 19% rise in the Group operating profit. Gases operating profit increased by 14.5%, to &#x20AC;625 million. This over proportionate growth compared to sales leads to an improvement of our Gases operating margin by 140 basis points to 26.7%.</p>
          <p>Compared to the last quarter, quarter four 2009, the Gases margin, if we adjust for the natural gas price effect, actually improved by around 20 basis points. On reported basis it remained stable. This positive development is the further proof of the HPO initiatives in our regions. Our Engineering Division recorded an operating profit of &#x20AC;51 million, up 13.3% on last year's level. With a margin of 9.9% we again stayed ahead of our 8% target.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that we took in the first quarter of 2009 a restructuring charge of &#x20AC;20 million into the operating profit on the corporate level. Adjusted for this one-time effect our Group operating margin was still up by a strong 140 basis points.</p>
          <p>I come to slide six now. The sales bridge gives you some more detail on the Gases performance. As I indicated earlier the currency effect turned positive with a sales contribution of 4.3% in the first quarter. Especially the South African rand, the Australian dollar depreciated strongly. The British pound as well as some currencies in Eastern Europe also had minor positive effects, while the US dollar was the only major country with an adverse exchange rate development. The natural gas price was positive in the quarter at 0.9%. I will later in my presentation refer to some specific items which were diluting a stronger underlying growth number in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On page seven, you find the sales development of our four operating segments. In line with the global economic recovery we have experienced volume improvement in our industrial end markets. Our emerging market activities showed the strongest growth momentum with, notably, Greater China as well as South and East Asia posting double-digit growth on a comparable basis. This has led the operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe to a sales increase of 17.3% to &#x20AC;502 million. The comparable sales improvement was 12.3%.</p>
          <p>Also the markets in Western Europe and the US have shown a further recovery. Our operating segment Western Europe posted sales of &#x20AC;970 million, up 3.7% on reported and 2.6% on comparable basis. The growth in Western Europe was diluted by a lower contractual pass-through of energy costs. This is one of the specific items which I just mentioned. Sales in the operating segment Americas increased by 2.6% to &#x20AC;514 million. The reported growth was effected by the negative exchange rate development of the US dollar.</p>
          <p>Our comparable growth rate in the Americas was 5.9%. This good underlying performance reflects an improving demand in our Metals, Chemicals and Manufacturing end markets in the US. South America maintained its positive growth momentum, with especially Brazil showing volume recoveries in the Bulk and Tonnage product areas. South Pacific and Africa posted a strong sales increase of 21.4% to &#x20AC;375 million. This development, however, reflects positive currency in Australia and South Africa.</p>
          <p>On a comparable basis sales declined by 3.9%, which brings me to the second specific item I mentioned before regarding the comparable gases sales growth. Our business in South Africa was impacted by lower commodity prices in LPG. Additionally, there was a smaller embedded finance lease impact on quarter one 2009 in South Pacific.</p>
          <p>Turning to the operating profit development, in our segments on page eight you see that all operating segments posted sizeable profit increases versus Q1 2009. The year-on-year margin increase of 140 basis points in the Gases Division was supported by HPO benefits in all segments. With an operating profit growth of 11.3%, to &#x20AC;275 million, Western Europe improved its margin by 200 basis points, to 28.4%. The operating profit in Asia and Eastern Europe increased by 20.2%, to &#x20AC;155 million the margin improved to 30.9%.</p>
          <p>Despite the exchange rate effect, our operating profit in Americas rose by 7.7%, to &#x20AC;112 million. The margin increase of 100 basis points, to 21.8%, reflects the further improved regional set up of our American activities. The 25.8% increase in operating profit in the segment South Pacific and Africa, to &#x20AC;83 million, was supported by currency. Also in this operating segment our improvement initiatives were effective, helping to drive the profit margin up to 22.1%.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows the sales development in the Gases product areas based on comparable growth rates. Excluding currency natural gas price and consolidation effects, the Tonnage segment posted highest year-on-year improvement with a 10.3% increase in sales, to &#x20AC;569 million. This good performance is the result of higher capacity loadings in our existing plants as well as the continuous ramp-up of projects out of our pipeline.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Healthcare business increased 2.7% on a comparable basis, to &#x20AC;265 million. For the full year, we expect the growth rate to be above the previous year level. In the merchant end markets, we have also observed a further improvement in market conditions in line with the general economic recovery in the different regions.</p>
          <p>In the Bulk business, the volume recovery led to a comparable sales increase of 5.2%, to &#x20AC;569 million. Cylinder sales of &#x20AC;937 million were in line with the previous year figure, as volumes in this business were impacted somewhat later during last year's recession. Cylinder rentals kept up well again in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Gases project pipeline on page 10, we have now already a considerable pipeline for 2012. Based on our signings until today, we will bring onstream 10 additional projects with a combined project amount of around &#x20AC;400 million. This is structured by onstream date. The improved investment climate resulted in several new projects, since our last communication. In the emerging market, for example, we signed new contracts in China, an Air Separation unit for Dina in Nanjing two steel reformers for GCL, two nitrogen generators for BOE in Beijing for TFT production, and in Korea, we signed a hydro prime project for Samsung, which is in <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>And today, as you have seen, hopefully, we announced a new contract with ArcelorMittal for a large Air Separation unit in Kazakhstan, in Temirtau. Besides being a sizeable Tonnage scheme, it will also allow us to further develop the business and liquid growth market in that area. Furthermore, we signed a new large contract for an Air Separation planned with our long-term customer, ThyssenKrupp, at their steel site in Duisburg in Germany.</p>
          <p>I come to the Engineering business now, which is on page 11. As I touched already up in the operating performance, the sales slightly down year-on-year, but operating profit increasing with a double digit rate, driven by another strong margin performance. As you know, you should not over emphasize the performance of the single quarter in this business. However, from an overall perspective, we can confirm that also the Engineering business is seeing positive signals in its end markets.</p>
          <p>Order intake in Q1 was &#x20AC;502 million, which is an increase of 76%. This order intake is driven by a multitude of smaller new contracts across our four segments and from different regions around the world. With this performance the order backlog stayed on a high level. With &#x20AC;4.3 billion we have good visibility for a relatively stable business development in the next two years. This brings me to the review of our cash flow statement on slide 12.</p>
          <p>We have in the first quarter increased our free cash flow, before financing by 58% to &#x20AC;206 million. Our operating cash flow reduced slightly from 412 million to &#x20AC;397 million, this is mainly due to the increase in our revenues compared to the previous year, which led to further increases in our trade working capital. In the first quarter, we made payments of &#x20AC;223 million for investments. For the full year, we still expect investments to exceed the level of 2009 the majority of the free cash flow was used for debt reduction.</p>
          <p>On slide 13 you see that our net debt, as shown on the balance sheet, was down to &#x20AC;6.054 billion at the end of the quarter. In April, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's upgraded our rating by one notch to A minus and A3 respectively. This upgrade is the result of our good financial performance in the crisis as well as the confirmation of our resilient business model.</p>
          <p>And in the medium-term, it is our goal to achieve a net debt/EBITDA ratio at the lower end of our target range of two to three times. Our outlook for this year, on page 14, remains unchanged from what we told you in March. It is based on the current market expectation for a moderate economic recovery in 2010. In the Gases division, we expect sales and operating profit to increase, with the operating profit exceeding the record level of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering division, we foresee 2010 sales to reach at least the 2009 level and confirm our target margin. For the Group, we confirm our guidance to return to growth in sales and operating profit in 2010, and it is our ambition to achieve again an over proportionate operating profit increase this year. We remain fully focused on HPO and confirm our target of 650 to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>This concludes the review of our quarter-one figures. We had a good start into the year, visible in a further recovery in our Gases business, a positive development of order intake in the Engineering and an over proportionate growth in Group earnings.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. We are happy to answer your questions now. Eva, operator please.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Jean de Watteville speaking, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jean,, we hear you very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I didn't know I was called Jean-Christophe, anyway. Yes, a couple of questions if I can. Just broadly speaking, you're obviously noting improvement of commercial activity in Tonnage in Engineering, and it would just be security if you could explain to us that what are the markets, that in your view, are improving compared to the last conference call. And in particular do you believe that you will be in a position to sign a coal-based contract in China this year? And that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on healthcare. I've noted that in this quarter the healthcare performance was actually slightly below the usual performance. I don't know if you could elaborate what as the reason behind that. And the last question I didn't hear very correctly. I think you mentioned that there was some impact of embedded lease accounting in Q1. I wonder if you could elaborate exactly on what was the impact and how should we read that. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Jean. Thank you for your questions. I will start with the later ones here. On the embedded finance lease issue, we had in quarter one 2009 a small embedded finance lease impact which is diluting here the growth rate because we do not adjust for that. This is one piece which I was mentioning in my presentation for Africa and South Pacific. The other two pieces which do have a dilutional impact on the comparable growth rate are the electrical contractual pass-through, especially in Western Europe which is on a lower basis and the commodity prices in South Africa. These were I think the three bigger items which were diluting the comparable growth rates.</p>
          <p>On the Healthcare performance, this is -- the numbers are not that big in the first quarter, as you know, therefore it looks a little bit below the average. These are a couple of smaller impacts but this is not something which concerns us here regarding the growth rate. Therefore, by statement we will be for the year on the level of last year, above the level of last year, I think this is clearly our expectations. These were some smaller impacts in the U.S., a little bit in the U.K., if we compare quarter by quarter because of when tender impact. Then we also saw some smaller items regarding hardware sales in the piping for our Healthcare business. So these are the main points regarding Healthcare. Regarding the Tonnage development, I now hand over to Dr. Aldo Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Jean. This is Aldo talking to you with regard to the resumed activity in Tonnage in Engineering. As you have seen from the nature of the announcements which we made this morning it's still a lot of steel business. Of course, in mature geography and in new geography, these projects have been developed along last year and now they come to fruition. But also you have seen very good signs in electronics which also lead to bulk investments.</p>
          <p>In general I would say the portfolio -- order intake portfolio in the Engineering is -- as Georg mentioned, is constituted by several small and medium-sized projects -- contracts and they are much more evenly distributed across the four major product lines in the Engineering than last year, so there is a nice distribution across Petrochemicals, Natural Gas, Air Separation and Syngas, and also geography. With regard to your question, coal-based contracts in China, I think it's much more probable that we will sign this year contracts for oxygen supply to coal-based Syngas project, Syngas, for instance, for the production of isocyanates and polyurethanes. So the, let's say, the more established, well-established chemical industry. But of course we are bidding also on projects where probably you are referring to, coal to liquids or coal to chemicals. There, as you know, we are much more selective. Linde Engineering is, of course, bidding flat out on these projects. With Linde Gas and Investments we are more selective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a confirmation, Mr. Denoke, when you say that you expect Healthcare sales to be -- when you mean that you -- when you said you expect Healthcare to be at least at the level of last year, you're talking about growth rate, not absolute sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about growth rate which was last year comparable, 4.7%, and we expect a growth rate of around 5% plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Okay. Thank you very much for your answers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Matthias Cornu. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Good morning, Matthias Cornu from Exane. Just a question on cylinders. You had suddenly no growth this quarter in cylinder, in fact, slightly lower versus Q4 last year. Can you be a bit more specific here what you've seen by region versus developed market and emerging market? And maybe on the sequential trend within the quarter, month after month, how March developed relative to January and February? And what do you see in April in this business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding the cylinder development I think we reported a flat comparable number here. We have seen at the end of the first quarter a much stronger development overall in our business. So the first two months were rather weak, also related to a tough winter. The other part which plays here into that business segment is what I already mentioned related to the specific items, which is the commodity pricing in Africa for our LPG cylinder business, which is a significant part of our African business.</p>
          <p>So when we go across the development -- and I think this is related to the mature businesses where we have, of course, a stronger -- much stronger impact from a starting point perspective in the mature countries. When we talk about U.K., when we talk about Continental Europe, and when we separate that from the emerging markets, where mainly in the emerging markets South America and Eastern Europe do have a very strong cylinder business position. So here we see in March a better development than in January, February. And in the mature countries it is what we really expect at the end of the cycle, that when the cylinder business moves into the crisis, this was much later than the rest of the business, and now this is a confirmation that it also comes later out of the business. So no specific trends, I think a pattern which we expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Thomas <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. UBS in Zurich. Thanks for taking my questions. You have revisited or confirmed your guidance for higher sales and operating, and I was just wondering whether you also think your operating cash flow can keep track with the sales and earnings growth this year, because it fell slightly behind at the start of the year? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then coming back to the growth in the Gases business, in Asia and Eastern Europe &#x2013; and it's probably following on from Matthias' question. Asia Eastern Europe segment grew 12.3% and South Pacific and Africa segment growth fell 3.9%. I was just wondering whether you could tell us how much the Eastern European part, within Asia and Eastern Europe, and the African part, within South Pacific and Africa, underperformed the segment average growth. So that we've a bit of a flavor of where the geographic upside or downside is as we progress through 2010. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think when we start with the last part of your questions, in Eastern Europe and in Africa of course we indicated that in South Africa, for example, it's mainly driven by the LPG commodity pricing. So from that end I would argue if you take the comparable number of minus 3.9%, the effect for Africa is probably nearly two times, so it's above minus 7%, close to 8%. In Eastern Europe the difference, because of a much better March, is not that significant compared to the other, only as an indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I just follow up? In Eastern Europe the business is growing across all delivery types, so it's Tonnage, Bulk and Cylinder are growing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Tonnage is, of course, a growth story and Cylinder is, as for the Group in total, in plateauing at the first quarter, so no significant growth. That would be a too-good description.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And the cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the cash flow. It is, of course, clearly our ambition to grow the cash flow. I think we have shown, really, through the working capital impact in the first quarter and a slightly negative impact if you compare year on year on operating cash flow, but our ambition is definitely to come out with a cash flow on last year's level or more, when we grow our operating profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, JPMorgan in London. Just one question, please. Within the Tonnage growth, I wonder if you could give an indication of how that &#x2013; the organic growth splits between what we bought over to be classify as recovery volume and then the contribution from startups and ramp ups? And then how you would expect that latter figure to contribute over the remainder of this year in terms of percentage growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we compare that, of course, we do not want to move too much into the detail. I think we see overall a capacity recovery from a utilization perspective which is contributing. Then we see ramp ups and startups. When we look into the next quarters, we see this rather on the same level, if we compare this quarter by quarter. And you know that there are also some joint venture impacts always included which you don't see in the top line, which are not driving these numbers. But overall I would argue quarter one is, in average, roughly that what we can expect for the next quarters too.</p>

          <p>Morning, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. A couple of questions, actually. I just wondered if, Georg, we can take the interest costs for Q1 as a sighter for the full year. They're certainly quite a bit lower than my forecast. Secondly, on the margins progression in Gases, from Q4 to Q1, not year-on-year, why are we only seeing a flat progression? Even with the revenue impact being only, what, 40 million, I still would have thought with cost savings you'd be getting a modest uplift in margin. So can you just walk me through maybe the mix effect or some other issues or, indeed, the LPG comment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start right with your last question. I mean if you compare here the sequential development quarter four/quarter one, we have to take into consideration that we do have here a natural gas price impact which is roughly 20 basis points. So margin would be 20 basis points higher if we compare the sequential development. And then the other comparable impacts which I was mentioning are, of course, included in that comparison, but the main impact I would argue is, here, natural gas price development. The first part of your question, can you repeat that for...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. The net interest costs in the P&amp;L, should we take that as a good sighter for full year run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think this is a little bit too good. I think, as you know, especially when we look -- I'm talking now here also cash development-wise. When we see interest payments we are participating still from our strategy where we have roughly half of our interest level on a variable part. So from that perspective we are participating. So, overall, I wouldn't be so bold to say that this is a walkthrough through the year. So please be a little bit shy on that strong interest development in the first quarter for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Peter Mackey. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. It's Morgan Stanley. A couple of quick questions, as most have been covered, thank you. Firstly, on the -- going back to the earlier question about the split of tonnage, a number of your peers have talked about margins coming down in the Tonnage business because of the effect of take-or-pay contracts dropping out as business -- underlying business has recovered this year. Can you give us an idea of the margin progression in your Tonnage business, given the impact of your HPO cost-cutting program, please?</p>
          <p>And also just, similarly, on margins and going back to Andrew's question there about the mix effect quarter-on-quarter, are you seeing an effect from -- I realize electronics is a smaller part of your business than, perhaps, a couple of your peers. But are you seeing an effect from lower margins in electronics, perhaps, diluting some of your Group margins in the Gases business, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Aldo. Your first question concerning the potential price improvement due to Tonnage projects coming off take-or-pay threshold, luckily, we didn't have too many of these contracts last year. So that we were operating more or less at take-or-pay, or a little bit above, so that this windfall is not very visible in our portfolio. So the majority of the margin improvement on Tonnage, in our opinion, is based on our HPO initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In electronics, I think there is no specific item, really, I would refer to and then confirm a kind of trend here. I think, as you know, our business is, of course, smaller from the total perspective, but we don't, and do not, see a change at that point of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Benson. Please go ahead with your question and announce the company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew Benson from Citi. Just on the Cylinder business you're talking about slow -- or delayed recovery. And that's consistent with the peers as well. There does appear to be a bit of adverse price pressure on that. And perhaps if you could just comment on how you see the pricing environment in Cylinders developing?</p>
          <p>Secondly, energy costs now seem to be increasing and, clearly, there's a pass-through in a part of the business, but how you think you'd be able to manage the pass-through of those costs where there's no automatic increase to your customers?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, can you just give a &#x2013; you've announced some major order wins here. Just give us an indication of the &#x2013; if you like, the unannounced pipeline and how that's developing? Again, you've given us some clues, but perhaps if you could talk a little bit in the Tonnage business in particular? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Aldo again. On this Cylinder price development, of course, in a market which is not growing significantly I think that we are still holding quite well with the pricing. As you know, we are competing also very much using our application technologies and cylinder services. I think that it's no reason to get excited. I think, definitely, we have to be very, very smart. But the price effect is negligible on Cylinders. Your second question was referring to Tonnage opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Yes. Obviously, you've announced some significant wins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just on how the pipeline of new orders is developing and the scope of it. Again, you've indicated you're likely to look for Engineering sales into the Chinese coal to chemicals rather than current contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have to maybe be very precise there. And I say that when it comes to, I would call, an ambitious coal-conversion projects with big schemes coat to fuels or coal to olefins, there, our preference is to compete as an Engineering Company. But when it comes to coal-based projects for conventional chemicals I think, there, we are, of course, fully engaged. And we see quite good numbers of projects based on coal in China, for instance, for hydrogen for refining or, as I say, synthesis gas and, there, we are working very, very hard.</p>
          <p>The demand of oxygen projects for steel is unabated and is across the board also in Europe or Central Asia and South America, for instance. I think that the pipeline is even distributed. And there are two or three or what we call mega-projects, some of them are energy-related and this is something which is, of course, very important for us and we'll stay very focused on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good morning, it's Norbert Barth from West LB. Perhaps, two questions looking a little bit more on the longer term. First of all, if you see how gas price developed in the last 12 to 18 months also compared to oil, how do you believe would that influence your businesses, especially your strategy on that segment?</p>
          <p>And a second question also a little bit looking longer. As you know, the electricity car is in much discussion in the public, and there was also this meeting in Berlin. I only want to ask does that change your view on your hydrogen project in the longer term, for mobility in the car? Or what is your consequence or outcome of that meeting for your strategy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your first question, natural gas development, as you know, nearly the totality of our natural gas purchases are pass-through items and they affect only marginally our profit situation.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of this year we have about some &#x20AC;20 million of natural gas price effects. I don't think that the gas price development is affecting our strategy. Of course, to make hydrogen we need it, and that's why we will continue to develop in gas-based projects.</p>
          <p>It could be, of course, that some energy-related projects, for instance, in North America, that these projects are now being affected somehow by the abundance of Shale gas available in North America. And this has eventually stabilized also the situation of certain big petrochemical projects in North America which have suffered in the past by the very high price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And on L&amp;G, in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, definitely, on L&amp;G of course I think that this will eventually lead to some slowdown in new L&amp;G of course I think that this will eventually lead to some slowdown in new L&amp;G schemes in the future, especially for very large base-load liquefaction projects. Coming to your second question, the mobility in terms of the electrical vehicle, well, we have announced last year, as you remember, our initiative, together with companies like Daimler Benz, for fuel cell cars, and fuel cell cars are electrical cars. The difference is that you produce your electrons on board with hydrogen. So we don't see an inconsistency between what, yesterday, Mrs. Merkel has initiated in Berlin and what we are doing at the moment with companies like Toyota and Daimler</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I can add, it looks like that fuel cell especially is going a little bit out of favor?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I recommend that you talk to the automotive segment.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line Peter Clark. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Peter Clark, Soc. Gen. Just two related ones, actually. The rental income on the Cylinder side, one of your peers was mentioning that dipped for them in the first quarter. Just wondering what had happened there. And then, tied in with that, actually, Western European margin's been very impressive quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Even if we were to see some dip just for a period on the Cylinders, which obviously have a high weighting in Western Europe, it does look like the HPO benefits are really driving the margin and make it look sustainable. Am I right in thinking you're confident on the Western European margin, even if we were to see some sort of rental dip on the Cylinder? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we see it from today's perspective, and as I mentioned it in my presentation, I think the rental development is -- we are satisfied with this development. I think this is as we expected and I think we do not want to play now a scenario question-answer game here of 'what happened if.' Of course, you're right, rental income is, in markets like U.K., in markets like Continental Europe, Northern Europe, an important part. But we have an integrated business model, and from today's perspective I think we are -- we learned in the crisis that the impact is definitely not as the market expected it.</p>
          <p>I think I would like to refer to that point. I think we saw that people in the business kept their cylinders to have service availability for their customers. And I think when you see the delta cost for their service availability against rental cylinder, then, they want to keep their service availability. So it's more against -- are people staying in the business, or not? So I think this is a more critical question. But at that point in time we do not see a change here in the first quarter.</p>
