          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Q2 Earnings Conference Call.  For your information, today's conference is being recorded, and at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, CEO.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our performance for the first six months of 2010 and the outlook for the year.  I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk; and with me, I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and several investor relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our home page, novonordisk.com, along with the slides that we'll be using for this conference call.  The conference call, basically it will last approximately one hour, and as usual will start with an outline of the presentation on slide number 2.  The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 20 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 3.  As always, I need to advise that this call will contain forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual result to differ materially from expectations.  For further information on the risk factors, see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.  Also note as mentioned, that this conference call is being webcast live and a replay is made available on Novo Nordisk's website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 4.  We're very satisfied with the performance in the first six months of this year.  Sales growth in the first six months was 14% reported and 11% in local currencies.  The performance is driven by continued penetration of our modern insulins in all key markets.  From a regional perspective, the key growth drivers have been North America and International Operations.</p>
          <p>Victoza was recently launched in Japan and we continue to see a solid performance of Victoza across launched markets.  But in R&amp;D, the key event during the second quarter of 2010 has been the completion of the patient recruitment for the phase 3 programme of Degludec and DegludecPlus which encompasses 17 clinical trials and more than 9,000 patients.  The first of five trials with DegludecPlus is now complete.  This trial confirms that DegludecPlus improved long term glycaemic control and reduced not hypoglycaemic events in people with type 1 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Within haemophilia, we have established clinical proof of concept for NN1731, an ultra fast-acting recombinant factor VIIa analogue based on the results of our phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of NN1731 in stopping joint bleeds.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials, our gross margin improved by 60 basis points to 80.5 during the first six months.  Operating profit grew 19% reported and around 15% in local currencies.  The solid performance of our underlying business and the encouraging Victoza launch performance enables us to raise financial guidance for 2010.  We now expect sales growth in the range of 9 to 10% in local currencies compared to 7 to 10% previously.  Operating profit growth in local currencies is now expected in the range of 12  to 15% compared to previous guidance of more than 10%.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 5, our portfolio of modern insulins continues to show strong performance overall.  In the first six months the portfolio of modern insulins was the main growth driver, accounting for almost 70% of total sales growth in local currencies.  Sales performance reflects the steady and durable penetration of our modern insulins in an expanding market.</p>
          <p>Victoza sales reached DKK 666 million in the first six months, representing more than 20% of sales growth this year in local currencies.  NovoSeven grew 11% reported and 9 in local currencies.  Sales growth for NovoSeven was primarily realized in North America and reflects increasing sales for the treatment of spontaneous bleeding episodes for congenital inhibitor patients.  Sales of our growth hormone therapy product, Norditropin, increased 6% in local currencies in the first six months, with all regions contributing to growth.  Novo Nordisk remains the second largest company in the global growth hormone market with 25% market share measured by volume.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update by region.  In the first six months, all regions contributed to growth measured in local currencies.  North America was the main contributor, with 63% share of growth measured in local currencies, followed by International Operations and Europe.</p>
          <p>In local currencies, sales in North America increased 20% in the first six months.  Sales growth was driven by strong performance of modern insulins and initial Victoza sales are solid, and we noted an encouraging level of reordering during the second quarter of 2010, following the distribution pipeline selling reported in the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>European sales grew 5% in local currencies, driven by continued brokerage for the portfolio of modern insulins and a solid performance of Victoza.  The volume growth of 4% of the European insulins market remains slightly lower than the global average of around 7%.</p>
          <p>Sales within International Operations increased 12% in local currencies for the first six months.  The main contributor of the sales growth was modern insulins, primarily in China.  Sales growth in Japan continues to be impacted by a change in the underlying insulin market dynamics where growth in the basal segment, in particular basal modern insulins, are accelerated at the expense of the pre-mix segment, where Novo Nordisk has its strongest position.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an overview of health care reforms across European markets.  In the first six months, they have been characterized that by discussing the surrounding health care reforms in Europe as a consequence of growing fiscal pressures in many European countries.  To date the announced health care reforms have focused on cost containment and are expected to have a negative financial impact on Novo Nordisk to the tune of a half a percentage point of global sales in 2010.</p>
          <p>For Novo Nordisk, the most significant impact is expected to arise from the health care reforms announced in Germany and Spain.  In Germany, the main impact from the reform is an additional 10% mandatory rebate for patented protected drugs; whereas the reform in Spain entails an additional mandatory discount of 7.5% on all drugs.  Currently, no reforms with significant impact on Novo Nordisk has been announced in the other three large markets in Europe: United Kingdom, France, and Italy.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the U.S. launch of Victoza.  The rollout of Victoza is progressing well, and the product has now been made commercially available in 14 European countries as well as U.S., Canada, and Japan, and three countries in International Operations.  We expect the rollout to continue throughout 2010.  In the U.S., Victoza launch performance is encouraging.  We are now 25 weeks into the launch and Victoza has gained more than 25% of the GLP-1 market.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to note that the GLP-1 market has expanded; measured both in volume and value since the launch of Victoza.  The volume of the number of weekly prescriptions have grown almost 20%. In value, the GLP-1 now constitutes approximately 4% of the overall diabetes market.  The level of awareness surrounding Victoza amongst physicians and patients remain high, and our strategic positioning of Victoza seems to resonate well with our target audience.  This positioning is reflected in market data showing that the majority of patients starting Victoza treatment previously were treated with tablets commonly used early in the progression of type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Mads, who'll give you an update on the development of our clinical pipeline.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars.  Please turn to slide 9.  Indeed related to Victoza we had more than 20 presentations at the 70th annual meeting of the ADA held in Orlando, Florida in June.  Let me start however, by mentioning that Novo Nordisk presented phase 2 data showing for the first time the efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles of Degludec and DegludecPlus.  The studies were as per regulatory requirement designed as treat-to-target studies and hence demonstrated non-inferior glycaemic control compared to insulin glargine while the risk of hypoglycaemia was lower for Degludec both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Phase 2 also revealed an extremely long action profile for Degludec highlighting the potential for a three times weekly dosing regimen in type 2 diabetes; a new paradigm which is currently being explored in phase 3a.  The first of five phase 3a studies with DegludecPlus has just been completed.  It is the trial in type 1 diabetes, a controversial setting for an insulin compilation product because insulin pre-mixes have been viewed as increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia because their two components neither allow for individual titration nor mimic a true basal/bolus profile.</p>
          <p>The randomised controlled global clinical trial encompassed one group treated with DegludecPlus once daily and NovoRapid twice daily and their comparative group receiving Levemir in accordance with the label, plus NovoRapid three times daily in a classical basal/bolus regimen.  While reducing the number of injections by at least one per day, the DegludecPlus group was furthermore non-inferior as regards to the primary endpoint HbA1c which decreased from 8.3 to 7.6 in both treatment arms.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia defined as the need for third party assistance or plasma glucose levels below 3.1 mmol/l, was reduced overall and by more than a third during the night for the DegludecPlus group.  Subjects treated with DegludecPlus and NovoRapid gained on average slightly more weight than those in the comparative group.  The safety profile of DegludecPlus was confirmed and DegludecPlus was well-tolerated among others demonstrating a very low propensity for injection site reactions and antibody formation.</p>
          <p>The trial has thus shown that DegludecPlus offers effective, safe and convenient treatment of type 2 diabetes with a reduced number of injections and hypoglycaemic episodes.  Novo Nordisk expects to announce key results of the remaining 16 phase 3a trials in the BEGIN and BOOST programmes during the second half of this year and the first half of next year when trials have been completed and analyzed.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 10 for an overview of our clinical pipeline within diabetes and obesity.  Novo Nordisk has completed a six-month phase 3b study with approximately 1,000 patients investigating the effect of intensifying Victoza treatment with Levemir in people with type 2 diabetes. Patients previously treated with metformin plus minor sulfonylurea were treated in a 12-week run-in period with metformin and Victoza titrated to 1.8 mg per day.  After the run-in period patients with an HbA1c below 7%, representing the majority of the population, continued on the treatment.  While those not below a HbA1c of 7% after run-in, were randomised to continue the treatment for 26-weeks with or without addition of Levemir.</p>
          <p>The randomised trial data revealed a statistically significant improvement in glycaemic control following Levemir add-on, with 43% of the previously inadequately treated subjects reaching the target versus 17% in the control group.  Importantly, the initial mean body weight loss of three to four kilograms achieved during the 12-week run-in period with Victoza was sustained in both treatment groups.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, no major hypoglycaemic event occurred and a very low overall rate of hypoglycaemia unprecedented for an insulin therapy and corresponding to a quarter of the hypoglycaemic event per patient year was observed in the GLP-1 insulin combination treatment arm.  This occurred in spite of an end of study HbA1c of close to 7% and should be compared to the 4T and other treat-to-target studies where annual hypoglycaemic events rates typically range from two episodes per year and upwards.</p>
          <p>Overall, this study demonstrated the combination treatment with Victoza and Levemir is efficacious, safe and well-tolerated.  The trial data including an ongoing six-month extension study which is currently ongoing are intended to be used for label expansion purposes for the Novo Nordisk products involved.</p>
          <p>Finally within diabetes, Novo Nordisk has initiated a phase 1 study in healthy people with an ultra-fast-acting insulin analogue intended to provide even faster onset of action than the currently available fast-acting insulin analogues.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11, for an update within haemophilia.  Novo Nordisk has just completed a double-blinded, randomised, controlled, dose-escalation phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, dynamics and efficacy of an ultra-fast-acting recombinant factor VIIa analogue, known as NN1731 in the treatment of joint bleeds.  The efficacy parameters included control bleeding, re-bleeding, pain, swelling, mobility and number of trial drug infusions needed.  Haemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors were included in the trial which was powered for the primary end-point, safety, and include NovoSeven as active comparative treatment.</p>
          <p>In the trial, NN1731 was found to have a very low rate of adverse event reporting, thus building further on the large therapeutic window described for this recombinant factor VIIa analogue in animal studies.  Likewise, the ultra-fast-action profile of the analogue was confirmed with a rapid peak factor VIIa clot activity exceeding that of NovoSeven by several fold at similar dose level and returning to levels below that of NovoSeven within one hour.  This translated into NN1731 being highly effective in stopping joint bleeds at doses of 20 mcg/kg and above. And in fact, all efficacy readouts trended favorably for NN1731 versus NovoSeven treatment at the highest dose of 80 mcg/kg.</p>
          <p>The NovoSeven control arm confirmed the good efficacy and clean safety profile of NovoSeven as observed in previous clinical studies in haemophilia patients with inhibitors.  Based on these positive safety and efficacy results in phase 2, regulatory meetings are being set up and a pivotal phase 3 trial for NN1731 is being designed aiming to take agency input from the inter-phase 2 meetings diligently into account.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 12 for an overview of our haemostasis pipeline.  A pivotal phase 3 trial in factor XIII, congenital deficiency, investigating a recombinant factor XIII compound, has been finalized.  This genetic factor XIII deficiency represents a very rare bleeding disorder with about 600 diagnosed patients worldwide.  It is usually diagnosed at birth and affects males and females from all ethnic backgrounds.  The trial enrolled 41 patients for one year on a once monthly intravenous recombinant factor XIII treatment regimen.</p>
          <p>The agent was found to be safe and compared to a historical control group of patients who did not receive prophylactic infusions, recombinant factor XIII significantly decreased, actually more than decimated, the annual number of bleeding episodes requiring treatment.  Novo Nordisk expects to file for marketing authorisation with the regulatory authorities in the U.S. and E.U. in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>With that over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads.  Please turn to the next slide.  We are pleased with the financial results for the first six months of 2010.  The total sales growth was 14% as reported and 11% in local currencies.  Growth was realised within both diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals, and the primary growth contribution originated from the modern insulins.  The gross margin for the first six months of 2010 increased to 80.5 compared to 79.9% in the same period of 2009.  This primarily reflects a favorable product mix impact due to the increased sales of modern insulins but also an impact of the launch of Victoza.</p>
          <p>Total non-production-related costs increased by 14% to 14.369 billion.  This development primarily reflects the costs associated with the global launch of Victoza impacting sales and distribution costs and the ongoing phase 3 programme for the next generation of insulins impacting R&amp;D costs.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the first six months of 2010 increased by 19% to 9.423 billion reflecting the solid sales growth, the increased gross margin and the higher level of license fees.  Net financials showed a net expense of 498 million in the first six months of 2010 compared to a net expense of 511 million in the same period of 2009.  The number of full-time employees has increased 5% primarily reflecting expansions in the markets in International Operations.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the currency development.  This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner.  Further, the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in our key invoicing currencies and the extent of hedging for the same currencies are shown.  During 2010 the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen have both appreciated versus the Danish kroner and they remain above the average level for 2009.</p>
          <p>The positive impact of these developments on our operating profits are to a large degree countered by a loss on our hedging contract which is reflected in our net financials.  For the first six months of 2010, the foreign exchange result was an expense of 460 million primarily caused by losses on foreign exchange hedging of U.S. dollar due to the appreciation of the dollar versus the Danish kroner.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial outlook for 2010.  Novo Nordisk now expects sales growth in 2010 of 9 to 10% measured in local currencies.  This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk key strategic products within diabetes care including continued global rollout of Victoza and biopharmaceuticals as well as expectations of continued intense competition, potential generic competition to NovoNorm/Prandin in the U.S. and E.U. and an impact from the implementation of health care reforms primarily in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be around 6 percentage points higher than the one measured in local currencies.  For 2010, growth in operating profit is now expected to be 12 to 15% measured in local currencies primarily driven by the increased level of sales growth expectations.  Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported operating profit is now expected to be 11 percentage points higher than the one measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2010 Novo Nordisk now expects a net financial expense of around 1.750 billion.  The current expectation reflect the expected full year losses on foreign exchange hedging contracts of around 1.3 billion.  In addition, hedging losses of approximately 550 million have been deferred for recognition in 2011.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2010 is still expected to be maintained around 23%.  Capital expenditure is still expected to be around 3.5 billion in 2010 primarily related to investments in the new insulin formulation and filling plant in China and new disposable device capacity in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are still around 2.7 billion, whereas free cash flow is now expected to be close to DKK 13 billion.  The increase in the expected cash flow for 2010 is reflected in an expansion of the share repurchase programme for 2010, which has increased with 1 billion to now DKK 8.5 billion.  All of the above expectations are based on the assumption of the global economic environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2010 and the currency exchange rate, especially of the U.S. dollar, remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during 2010.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results.  Lars will now moderate the Q&amp;A session.  Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question today comes from Sam Fazeli from Piper Jaffray.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my question.  I'll try and stick to two. Just a very quick one on the Degludec data, was the hypoglycaemia, or was overall hypoglycaemia rate a secondary endpoint in the trial rather than the nocturnal part, and if that's the case, did you &#x2013; was that endpoint met?  And also you mentioned that the number of injections were reduced by at least one, can you comment on that a little bit more as to whether you actually had a number of patients who needed less?  So that's, I hope that counts as one question on Degludec.  And also just very quickly, in terms of the factor VII timelines, you did mention you're going to have meeting with the FDA, et cetera.  Is there any way you could give us a little bit more color as to you're looking for this product on a 2014, 2015 base in terms of filing and also would you expect it to have the same gross margins as NovoSeven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  We will count that as two questions and Mads, the first is surrounding the Degludec and the issue about whether or not the overall hypo rate was a secondary endpoint and whether it was met. And then, put a little color on your comment on number of injections, and then perhaps with some caution of course comment on the timeline for the NovoSeven follow on compound NN1731. And then we'll talk about &#x2013; Jesper will talk about the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well Sam, as regards to hypoglycaemia, it is by definition a secondary endpoint in the regulatory driven type 1 diabetes trial because it's the only one we do in type 1 diabetes and hence A1c, hemoglobin A1c has to be the primary endpoint to show that we have an effective product.</p>
          <p>Now, it was with some worry that we went into this because we've been through all the literature on pre-mixed insulins in the use in type 1 diabetes and in all the cases where they have been non-inferior versus basal/bolus treatment they have been distinctly inferior in causing more hypoglycaemic episodes.  But hypoglycaemia measured both as severe hypos, overall and nocturnal, and what we call confirmed hypos, overall and nocturnal, were secondary endpoints measured according to different diagnostic criteria.  And indeed, whichever way we look at it on all parameters DegludecPlus came out better, i.e. with fewer hypoglycaemic episodes than the basal/bolus.</p>
          <p>This occurred in spite of the fact that the group with DegludecPlus did not have titration of both the branch and the rep in DegludecPlus and the basal because it's in one compound or in one product.  And the amount of injections was three per day; two NovoRapids and one DegludecPlus.  In the case of the basal/bolus arm, Levemir was used as per label implying use once or twice daily plus three times NovoRapid implying that the basal/bolus group was receiving four to five injections per day and the DegludecPlus group receiving three injections per day. So that means that there was between one and two reductions in injections per patient day.</p>
          <p>And then as I mentioned, we did see &#x2013; let me give you a ballpark figure without being too detailed.  These are type 1 diabetic individuals, so they will have several episodes. Typically more than five episodes of nocturnal hypos per patient year and that is reduced as we say by more than a third, which if you measure that statically speaking, becomes significant. And if we look at severe episodes, it's the same story.  So I have to say, we're very happy with it.  It's probably in my mind the first time that a combination product has been able to match on hemoglobin A1c and b stronger on hypoglycaemia and on convenience.</p>
          <p>As regards the NN1731, we are now over the next the month or two targeting or not only targeting, we are factual having a meeting with the FDA; first as conference call, phone call and then as a face to face meeting to plan the phase 3 studies. And before we have that completed, i.e. taken into account FDA and EMA input, scientific advice typically from the EMA, we will not give you the direct timelines.  Obviously, phase 3 is one single pivotal trial, but the absolute design of that we'll get back to you, I hope, next quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jesper just comment on what expected margins from that product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, assuming that a product like that would be priced fairly similar to the current product, NovoSeven and noting that NovoSeven clearly is among the absolute top gross margin product in our portfolio, one should assume very similar Degludec gross margins. That's the prime comment we have at this point in time.  We'll have to see how the practical use will be in terms of dosing, etc that will be in the final phase 3 before we can comment on the absolute contribution from the product longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and this is Lars here.  Then of course there's also the competitive base here. Once we get through registration and launch, will there be a generic or bio similar and on the same products on the market? So you can contend that this is slightly difficult to project but the pricing strategy would be similar to what we know today with NovoSeven.  And with regard to the DegludecPlus, again here the conclusion is that this was a regulatory requirement; it's not intended for us to see DegludecPlus as a mean to stay in type 1 treatment, so we were encouraged with these results.  Thank you very much.  Let's have the next question please?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen.  Thank you for taking my question, also thank you to Sam for asking some good questions.  So I will just ask a little about the operational expenses levels. What we've seen in the first and second quarters, are those the levels that we should be expecting for the remainder of the year or will we see some increases due to the clinical trial activities?  That's actually all from me, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Certainly we are seeing a significantly higher expense level due to clinical trials as we have been ramping up and completing our Degludec and DegludecPlus trials and in as much as we are also now starting off the LEADER trials.  And so I think you should expect a similar level of operational expenses, not an expansion of the sales and distribution costs, but at a similar level of R&amp;D expenses in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So expansion of R&amp;D and sort of flat on sales and distribution?</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Peter Verdult of Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, Peter Verdult here with Morgan Stanley.  Two questions; one for Jesper, just given the likely change in the competitive landscape in the GLP-1 market in October, can you just walk us through kind of thoughts about maintaining or increasing share of voice and basically what are the sales force plans, broadly speaking, to make sure that Novo maintains that?  Secondly, just for more on Degludec, with regards to the specific or the key head to head data against LANTUS, is it still right to think that that data, top line data should be coming to the market around December or January? Could you just confirm that, please?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Yes, we'll revert with the timeline for the remaining of the trials that are going to be forthcoming during the second half, but Jesper just give a comment on your perspective of the GLP-1 market and competitiveness there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you rightly referred to Peter, it's primarily an issue related to the sales forces in the U.S.  As you also are aware, we have historically adjusted our sales force in the U.S. with the frequency of around every second year and last time we adjusted sales force, increased it in preparation for the Victoza launch, albeit slightly early, was at the turn of 2008 into '09.  So, the turn of this year would be an appropriate time for us to look at our sales force again.  Also noting that we not only have to continue to push a successful rollout of Victoza in the U.S. towards the primary care physician, but at the same time maintain good momentum behind both primarily Levemir and NovoLog in the U.S.  So, that would call for a expansion of the sales force in the U.S. and we're looking at this.  Currently you should expect an expansion towards the turn of the year and what we are trying to &#x2013; the way we are trying to implement it is in a way where it will have limited impact on the relationship between the physician and the rep.  So it should be expected to be an expansion of our current sales forces primarily directed towards primary care physicians.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Jesper, and then Mads when would you be able to say a little bit more about the data for the Degludec trials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well we actually have a multitude of head to heads versus insulin glargine, but I think the ones that are maybe of even greater interest than certain others of course the big 12-month studies where we go head on in type 2 diabetes and also in type 1 diabetes. Two of them are with 1,000 patients and one of them is with around 600 in type 1, and it is true that they do report around the turn or they do complete around the turn of the year.  To what we are speaking of is an extremely busy first quarter next year whether you're a medical writer, a statistician or for that matter even management because we'll be <mark type="inaudible" />.  So that is true Peter; those are the timelines and they will not be changed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick financial ones; firstly on the license fees, I know that 1Q had a one off, but generally it looks like that's going to come in a bit higher than your previous guidance of 550 so if that's now a bit low and then looking beyond 2010 whether we should continue at this slightly higher level?  And then secondly, any chance you can give us some sort of breakout on or what the U.S. Victoza sales, if any, where in Q2? Just to try and get a sort of underlying growth in Europe?  Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Jesper, license fees and an outlook for 2011 on license fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  The license fees for this year is still expected to be in the ballpark of 550 million and then as you rightly noted included a 100 million non-recurring one-time fee in relation to an IP settlement.  So you can say the underlying level of intellectual property income is in the ballpark of 450 million, which I also believe at present, is a reasonable guidance for the level for 2011.  And the second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the second question deals with the quarterly aspect of the U.S. business. We have not &#x2013; we have decided in this early part of the launch not to disclose the quarterly.  It is such that we can already now see that the contribution from the U.S. business is very, very significant and what we have stated in the announcement is that we have seen significant reordering meaning that we still have the predominant part of the sales in the first half in the first quarter for a very significant reordering in the second quarter.  So you should expect going forward that we will see a dominating part of the business for which is coming from the U.S. and we should get into regular quarters where you see gradual growth as the demand fills up.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello and good afternoon gentlemen.  Henrik Simonsen, Enskilda.  Lars just to translate your health care reform percentage into real money; if we take U.S. and Europe together I would assume you have a hit to the tune of say round about 750 million this year and then rising correctly to 1.5 billion next year. Is that the right way to interpret your numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is, that is. That's approximately the right number. It could actually be a little bit higher...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...because we are seeing a growth of the impact in the U.S. Estimating the impact in Europe is somewhat difficult.  If you're making reference to those that have been implemented then I think you're correct.  We have to assume that things will be implemented in some of the countries where we had not seen legislation come through.  So you might actually be a tad higher than what you are suggesting. For next year's...</p>

          <p>Actually, I do get these reports.  It's not something that I knew of that well, but I'll go and have a check, Henrik.  Right now we meet once a month to look at our own safety data base based on everything reported from Europe and U.S. and there's nothing concerning related to pancreatitis and for sure no cases of the hemorrhagic necrotizing.  So the safety profile is completely undisturbed as we communicated previously.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan.  Thanks for taking my couple of questions.  Basically on Victoza, I'm just wondering whether there was any stocking in this quarter's figures; obviously not in the U.S. but in terms of the rest-of-world sales as you rollout into other markets. I'm just wondering where we are in terms of the rollout in the ex-U.S. countries.  If you could give us a sort of percentage in terms of the total rollout that you're targeting, that would be useful.  And then secondly on Victoza as well, just in the U.S. I'm wondering how much of a contribution you're seeing from endocrinologists relative to primary care physicians.  Those two questions would be great.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  This is Lars Rebien here.  Let me start with the last question first.  It is so that in most markets and indeed, in fact, also in the United States as we speak the predominant part of the strengths are coming from the endo &#x2013; from the specialists.  We have, we've done a classic rollout where we bring the specialist on board and then we roll out later to the PCPs. And we're standing right at that junction right now in the United States where we're going to broaden up and reach more broadly into the PCPs.  We've also just very recently had our detailing aid approved by DDMAC [Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications], so there is still some improvement in our marketing efforts in the United States to come.</p>
          <p>With regard to the rollout in the other markets, we have rolled out in 14 European countries.  We have only two months rollout in France, which is a major European market.  It's a little bit difficult for me to calculate at this point in time how large a proportion of the remaining market potential we have covered.  We have no sales for Japan and we are expecting a significant business opportunity for the product in Japan and we of course also are expecting large markets in the overseas in Turkey and in China to be amenable to the product.  So I think we are still only scratching the surface, but the main part we still retain is the U.S. part of the business and you're going to see going forward that the predominant part of the business will come from the U.S.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Michael Novod of Handelsbanken.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just some few follow up questions; one is to the sales force expansion. Will the sales force expansion by the end of 2010 mean that you are now also then set for the launch of Degludec and DegludecPlus, or should we expect you also to add on significant sales force around 2012 before the launch of those two new insulins?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps you could elaborate a bit more on both International Operations and also on Japan. Are there any significant changes in trends compared to pressure in International Operations that we should be worried about?  And then also for Japan, when do you see this extremely, so you can say, sluggish trend change? Do you see any signs of that changing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Michael. This is Lars here.  Well this, you know it's a little bit delicate commenting too much in detail about the sales force expansion, as it is a key tactical issue for us.  But what we have noted up until now in the United States, which is the most important observation, is that our modern insulins business has not deteriorated as a result of an over-focus on Victoza.</p>
          <p>And so what will determine the way we deal with the sales force expansion at the end of the year will depend on; one, how the market reacts at that point in time, i.e. are we still having a pull through of our modern insulins as a result of the increased awareness in the physician's office of our company and our brand and our portfolio?  Number two, how is the competitive situation?  We will be guiding you to an expansion in connection with the full year result of the sales force in United States and elsewhere, which is also capable, I would suggest, of launching Degludec and DegludecPlus.  So the next step we take, as we don't want to disrupt the sales force too often, we'll be also able to deal with the launch of Degludec and DegludecPlus.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the second part of your question, IO and Japan.  In IO, there are a couple of pressures.  There are pressures from health care reforms and then there are &#x2013; part as a result of that, also pressures from bio-generic manufacturers.  We are talking primarily in China and in Russia.  You know that we have been significantly impacted in our biopharm business in Russia as a result of local initiative to favor local manufacturing of essential drugs, and they are actually coming out of healthcare reform and strategic initiatives at the policy level by the government.  So you have to combine those when you look at the IO markets. Then you will also have the normal run-of-the-mill health care reforms in such major markets as Turkey and other markets, that are significant to us that are facing the fiscal pressures that we also feel in Europe.</p>
          <p>With regards to Japan, the sluggish development we have, we have increased our sales force in the beginning of this year and towards the end of last year.  We hope, of course, that we'll see a stabilization.  We seem to notice stabilization in the trend of our insulin market share, but the Japanese market will remain sluggish until we see the impact from Victoza and the eventual launch of Degludec and DegludecPlus.  That is the nature of our business and the price reforms that are happening in Japan.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Martin Parkh&#xF8;i of Danske Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, also two questions from me.  Firstly, with respect to DegludecPlus, just if you can make some comments on the weight gain with DegludecPlus compared with Levemir; anything we should be concerned about that?  And maybe also you can comment that, what should we expect in comparison with LANTUS, given that Levemir probably already has a better weight profile than LANTUS?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is regarding your long-term guidance. Now we are half through 2010 you're still changing now for 2010, it's better than your initial guidance.  Are you seeing anything which have changed your view on the long term guidance that you still expect the 15% growth on operating profit, and 2010 is only a low year due to the investment in Victoza launch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Martin.  Mads, will you comment on the extent that you can? Of course, it's first of all the observations are of a narrow amount of patients and basically understanding of why we have weight loss with Levemir; that's not as clear as we all would have liked to. What's your take on this and also comparing to LANTUS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what you can say, at Levemir if you look at the totality of the randomised control assays being conducted, it's probably the only insulin that has panned out as being either weight neutral or at least having weight benefits compared to all other insulins being LANTUS and in patients who against which it has been tested on the one hand.  At the same time, it has had this highly beneficial hypoglycaemia profile by reducing hypoglycaemic episodes.  And you can say somewhat surprisingly, we actually saw a reduction in the hypoglycaemia for DegludecPlus, given even in a combination product up against Levemir, which was a positive surprise.</p>
          <p>On the body weight side, what we're speaking about is a kilogram, and a kilogram over half a year is the same magnitude of the benefit that Levemir would have against LANTUS or Inpatresol.  So that is a possibility, but not a proven fact that the only insulin that confers a specific weight benefit would be Levemir, and where Degludec really pans out is the low glycaemic variability, the less frequency of hypoglycaemia, more convenience, long action profile, et cetera, et cetera.  But that remains to be seen.  We have 16 trials to be analyzed and completed before we know the full profile on this specific parameter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, and then it's Lars here.  Before I give the word to Jesper to offer his views on the long-term term guidance, you will recall that we announced that this year would be a challenging year for a number of reasons.  One was that we're expecting a patent run-out of Prandin.  We are expecting impact.  We were expecting impact of U.S. healthcare reform, and you could say that impact from both of these two risk factors have been modest; more modest than we anticipated, but they are going to be felt entirely and fully in 2011.  So they're lower than long-term guidance of performance, if you want, in 2010 is going to be somewhat more positive and so then we are going to be having some pressures next year.  But Jesper, will you care to comment on this sort of more long-term view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the final comment there would be that you could see now in the local currency growth estimates we're giving that high end of that is actually the 15% local currency growth objectives that we have in the longer term picture, which we believe is quite attractive to deliver in a year where we are rolling out a future blockbuster like Victoza.  So we're confident in the financials we see this year that they are well in line with the long-term guidance we gave.</p>
          <p>In terms of obtaining the long-term targets for 2010, of course, clearly that is being positively impacted by the significant increase we've had in all major currencies and not only the U.S. dollar and yen, but also a number of significant other currencies which we do not hedge, have actually moved in our favor in 2010.  Overall, that could make it possible potentially for us to reach the long-term target.  We'll have to see when we get to the full year report and the sales whether we can reach the targets we've set.  If that's feasible, then we'll have to look at new targets and then provide them.  And again you should expect them to be announced when we have realized the old targets.  So, whether that's going to be '10 or '11 will depend on a few swing factors, including currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and I think &#x2013; this is Lars here. I think that it is worth noting what I just mentioned before that you're now seeing that we have such a big market presence, in particular the United States, but also elsewhere that we can launch big products without significant immediate expansion of our sales force, and yet not lose traction on the large part of the portfolio.  So, I would assess that we in the future, as we launch products in the diabetes area, being Degludec, DegludecPlus that we can do this with relatively modest additional increases in sales force because it is our home field.  We have a strong position.  We have portfolio approach and therefore I think we should be in a good position to retain our objective of growing operating profit of 15% on average year-by-year, with the exception of certain years where there are patent run outs, where there are certain one-off elements, or where we have significant headwind from the currencies.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi gents; two quick questions.  When the ACCORD study was published a couple of years ago, there was some chatter amongst diabetologists that we could see a slowdown in insulin volumes not treating patients as aggressively.  It never really came.  You still see some diabetologists talking about that. Is it ever going to have any effect, do you think, or is it something we should just completely put behind us, because maybe nobody gets treated in the real world that aggressively anyway?  Is it something that we can completely ignore?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the whole LANTUS cancer concern, we're not really seeing much in numbers in terms of share shifts, et cetera.  What's your take on the feeling amongst patients and diabetologists as to how real it is? Are you getting many questions asked?  How do you think that will pan out going forward?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Mads, the ACCORD study and the aim of trying to drive Hb1Ac (sic) [HbA1c] very, very low and with that incurred risks and whether or not that has in the real world of everyday practice impacted the insulin usage.  And then your sentiment on the LANTUS cancer issue; whether or not that has had any significant impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually Stuart, that's a good question on the ACCORD.  As you probably would have followed, things are emerging that make it even more complicated and it was not a fact that people bringing down the A1c fast caused them to suddenly die from a sudden death and so on.  What turns out to be more the case is that those who were in the intensively treated group and who failed to achieve the HbA1c of 6.5, i.e. those who despite being in intensive group were above 7, they had an increased propensity towards hypoglycaemia and death.  So the conclusion there is that it may well more be the glycaemic variability in difficult to treat patients that drives this problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that is true, which I think is the sentiment among many cables at this point, then any drug that reduces glycaemic variability by having a low day-to-day variance or variability between and within patients is a preferred drug, and in that regard Degludec and DegludecPlus will come in extremely handy.  So, we are not seeing any negative sentiment, neither towards the target of going below 7 nor to watch the usage of insulin, and that is fine in line with the latest evolutions from the ACCORD study.</p>
          <p>As regards the diabetes and cancer relationship, the ADA and the American Cancer Society consensus report that came out in Diabetes Care in June does say that we need more studies to see whether LANTUS is associated with an increased risk of cancer.  And they do overall say that for the average patient, it should not be, cancer should not be the determining factor of which product to use.  When that is said, we have a situation where, of course, it's still unclear and that means we need more studies.  And we know the company per se, i.e. Sanofi-Aventis, are doing their studies as I believe are requested by some regulators.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But also, we are aware that others in the academic society and community are doing data-based analysis and registry analysis, and we will see what comes out of those at down the road.  I think the jury is still out on this one.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An interesting observation here, this is Lars Rebien here adding in.  It seems to be the consensus that high levels of insulin do increase the risk for cancer.  Being that high levels of insulin injected exogenously or endogenously, and the interesting aspect here is that that would bode very well for a combination therapy between insulins and GLP-1s, where you get the glucose lowering effect.  The glucose-dependent lowering effect by the GLP-1, which prevents the hypos and you get the lower risk of cancer because the lower dosage of insulin.  So there's a lot more to be seen here, but I think there are combination therapies that may go a long way in terms of giving a better risk profile for people with type 2 diabetes in general.</p>
          <p>Thank you, next question, please.</p>

          <p>We now have Lars Hatholt from Nordea.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, yes, good afternoon, Lars here from Nordea.  I had a question regarding your guidance, where you've said that some of the explanations for your raised guidance that you're announcing a delay of generic competition on Prandin.  Could you be more specific about your expectations that you put into your guidance regarding this generic competition and the effect on Prandin sales in 2010?</p>
          <p>And furthermore, regarding your guidance on net financial expense, I think that if you put it down pretty significantly, you could say.  I'm aware that of course you're losing on your hedging contracts because of the appreciation of the dollar, but there must be some other explanations, I think, because we haven't seen that extent of dollar appreciation since last reporting, as far as I can see it. So, yeah, that was my question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much and two questions.  Jesper, I think since this was last year's legal matter, could you give your assessment of where we are with Prandin and what we had actually put in, in terms of assumptions for the year, and then the adjustment, the significant adjustment of the net finance and where you arrived that from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lars.  First on the assumptions surrounding the generic competition for Prandin in both U.S. and Europe, it was our anticipation that we would have generic competition occurring both in U.S. and in Europe by mid-year. We have had it in Europe in Germany, but the key markets of both France and Italy are coming here in the third quarter, and that will add significantly.  I know that it's 500 million out of 1 billion of Novo Nordisk sales in Europe which are related to Italy and France and there, there will be generic competition.</p>
          <p>As for U.S., we had a patent validity trial ongoing in U.S. and that, there was a hearing in that court case in June.  It was, however, not concluded and that court case is continuing into August and depending on the outcome of that trial there could be generic competition occurring in the latter half of this year. And, of course, you see that we bring forward a range and that range include that this trial could develop both favorable and unfavorable for Novo Nordisk.  So that's as precise as you can get it from me.  In terms of the finance, it's rightly noted that the adjustment we've made to our net financials are over and above the negative impact from the hedging of currencies.  There are even addition &#x2013; more than a couple of 100 million in interest expenses related to non-recurring tax issues which we don't expect to be relevant for subsequent years, but that remains to be to remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper.  And then ladies and gentlemen I have to disappoint you, one last question and then we have to be moving on, seeing some of you perhaps in the afternoon.  Last question please?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our last question today comes from Tim Race of Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I feel honored for the last question.  Just two questions if I may though.  The first one, the ultra-fast-acting insulin analogue, can you just talk around why you're developing this product? What you might need for new product here sort of other than the obvious need for a new patent and price point in the future?  And then perhaps just maybe I missed this, but was there any stocking of human insulin in China and any overstocking effects on the important insulins that you can talk about at all?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  Mads, what are the objectives and needs seen from a patent perspective over and beyond what commercial needs we might have to continue building on a franchise which is quite attractive, in terms of short-acting or ultra-fast insulin analogue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I think if you're a diabetes patient your need for an onset of insulin action is actually rather fast and with the insulin analogues we know today like NovoRapid, we've gone from a max action profile going from two hours in human insulin, down to one hour on NovoRapid.  But it seems as if even further acceleration of the onset of action while trying to retain the offset of action more or less as it is for the analogues would provide the most physiologically ideal profile for the glycaemic excursions that we've seen people with diabetes.  So there is indeed a potential unmet patient need, but of course it depends on also proving the benefits typically in the form of less late hypoglycaemias and potentially less body weight gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads, and yes I have to apologize. I didn't answer before about in terms of stocking, that, no, there is no significant stocking effect in the second quarter because the most significant one was the one we had in the U.S. in the first quarter.  But apart from that, Jesper, let me ask you, any unusuals in the second quarter that we should note?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's been a remarkably stable quarter.  So we have not noted any levels of stock piling neither for human insulin, nor for modern insulin.  So, basically we see the reported sales for Q2 as a, except for the adjustment related to Victoza and the pipeline filling there in Q1 as a pretty accurate reflection of the underlying market growth surrounding our product.  So you could take that as the best estimate for market growth.</p>
