          <p>Hello everyone. This is Carlos Sequeira, Head of UBS Pactual LatAm Telco Research. On behalf of UBS Pactual, I would like to welcome you all to Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call. We have today in Mexico City Mr. Daniel Hajj, Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's CEO and Mr. Carlos Garcia-Moreno, Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's CFO.</p>
          <p>Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you, Carlos. Good morning everyone. Before going into the summary of our third quarter results, which Carlos Garcia-Moreno will present in a few minutes, I wanted to take this opportunity to present to you our views as to the outlook of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil in the coming months given the extraordinary circumstances that financial markets has been under recently. First I would like to mention that going into this crisis the Latin American countries where we operate were in a strong shape. Public finances have improved bringing down public debt levels. Inflation was almost everywhere well contained. Private-sector debt was relatively low and banks were well capitalized.</p>
          <p>The countries where we were for the most part generating surpluses. These countries have a solid fundamentals. They were well-positioned to withstand the deterioration of the international economic situation. These are countries that have the desire and the capability to raise a greater part of their economic growth on the expansion of their domestic markets.</p>
          <p>Whereas economic growth rates may be affected by the international environment, we believe that Latin America will be less affected than other regions. Growth rates will remain higher and will recover more rapidly than in the rest of the world and the currencies of the region, which has been subject to great volatility over the last few weeks are relatively -- are likely to stabilize at more reasonable levels. Looking specifically at our business, wireless penetration rates still have a way to go in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Mexico, Brazil and Peru, which alone represent 225 million pops, could see their wireless penetration rates increase by 15% points in the next two years. Revenue growth even in a tougher environment will be supported by subscriber growth. Down the road, data revenues are likely to become meaningful. Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is well-positioned to assist the economic and financial volatility as opposed to our remain competitors we already are far advanced in the deployment of our 3G networks, which today cover 16 countries in a common GSM UNPS platform.</p>
          <p>We have great coverage after investing in it for years and our networks now have ample capacity, thanks to the investments we carry out over the last few months. Most of the hard work regarding the modernization and expansion of our networks is behind us, whereas we will continue to invest to remain well ahead of the market and of our competition.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures will likely continue to fall relative to sales. We feel very comfortable with our operations. They are lean and they are efficient. We will step up our efforts to make sure that they remain so and that we maintain our competitive edge. We are now number one in three of our top four countries in the region and number two in Brazil, where we continue to gain market share. We have a great momentum in this market.</p>
          <p>We have always run an operation that is very strong financially. We deliberately kept our leverage rates down as we have known for years that the financial volatility that from time to time has affected our region is best faced from a strong financial position.</p>
          <p>Our credit ratings are among the best in the regions. Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil also has a good track record when it comes to acquisitions. For years we have proved that we are disciplined, engaging in acquisitions only where there is a clear value to be had for our shareholders. Today we are not talking to anyone regarding acquisitions.</p>
          <p>We have returned to our shareholders via share buybacks, repurchase and dividends $1.8 billion in 2005, $2.2 billion in 2006, and $4.9 billion in 2007. Today we believe there is nothing that can capture greater value for our shareholders than buying back our stock. With the most advanced technological platform in the region, great coverage and distribution, a lean efficient operation and a strong financial position, we believe we can continue to make inroads in our markets and help them attain higher penetration rates even at a time of greater economic uncertainty in the world.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will now pass it to Carlos for the summary of our third quarter results. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. Thanks Carlos Sequeira and UBS for conducting the call. We had a strong showing in terms of subscriber growth in the third quarter, with net additions of 10.3 million that exceeded by 18.3% those obtained the year before. Our net subscriber additions were nearly 30% higher than the consensus figures. In the nine months to September we obtained a total of 19.2 million new subscribers <mark type="inaudible" /> 2007.</p>
          <p>Nineteen million was the guidance that we gave you last year for our net additions in 2008. That's where we have already through September. Brazil led the way with 2.6 million additions in the quarter, which was 48% more than a year before. It was their third best quarter ever. With 35.7 million subscribers, Claro has taken over the number two spot in Brazil in terms of subscribers. As Daniel said, we have a very good momentum going forward in that market.</p>
          <p>Mexico followed with 1.5 million net gains and then came Colombia with 1.2 million; both countries generated more net additions than a year before. Colombia in particular have seen a major acceleration of subscriber growth. We have attracted more clients and we lost number portability in both Mexico after three months and Brazil after one month. Overall number portability has not been an important issue to date. In the U.S., Ecuador and the Caribbean subscriber additions were also higher than in 2007. As of September, we had almost 173 million subscribers and 3.9 million landlines.</p>
          <p>Our revenues for the period totaled 85.3 billion pesos driven by service revenues, which expanded 10.4% year-on-year. Service revenues were very much in consensus although analysts have factored in somewhat larger equipment base. I think is important to mention that organic growth has been two percentage points higher than the number that I cited. But it has been understated by the relative movements of the exchange rates of our various operations. What I am trying to state here is at constant exchange rates our rate of growth of service revenues would have been two points higher than the 10.4% that we mentioned right now.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year service revenue growth totaled 24% in Argentina. <mark type="inaudible" /> Paraguay and Peru, and 31% in Ecuador and 17% in Brazil. Mexico and the US had approximately 10% growth rate. The quarter data revenue increased 35% year-on-year, led by Brazil with 67%, Colombia with 48% and Argentina with 34%. Through September our revenues totaled 261 billion pesos. Service revenues increased by 14.7% year-on-year for the nine months through September, partly due to the fact that our Puerto Rican operation was not consolidated until second quarter of 2007, and that affects yearly comparison.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA came in at 34.9 billion pesos and represented a margin of 40.9%. This margin was similar to the ones in the year before. In spite of the much rapid pace of subscriber growth.  Results delivered much greater subscriber growth than the market had expected and that we have had last year and it was delivered roughly the same EBITDA yield.</p>
          <p>With depreciation down to 11.9% of revenues, we have now depreciated for the most part our TDMA and CDMA networks. Operating profits rose 25% year-on-year to 25 billion pesos. As of September, slightly less than 20% of our net debt was exposed to U.S. dollar. We consider this to be a prudent exposure considering that over 13% of our revenue in the preceding nine-months were dollar-based. Our net foreign exchange losses of the Brazilian gains in our forward positions totaled 2.2 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Within our income tax provisions, we're including an amount of 700 million pesos that have been paid on accounts of our share repurchases, but which may be credited against any income taxes to be paid after January 1, 2009.</p>
          <p>Our net profit rose 31.6% year-on-year to 12.4 billion pesos. Earnings per share have risen 37% and earnings per ADR 46% from a year before. Through September we have made a net profit of close to 44 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures totaled 45 billion pesos in the first nine months of the year and our distribution to shareholders' dividends and share repurchases 41 billion for a total of 86 billion pesos. Most of it was funded with our cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>Our net borrowings in the period were only 13.7 billion pesos. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 0.78 times. The average life of our debt is 9.2 years. Today we have $1.3 billion in cash, which compares to the debt amortizations that we have through the end of 2009, which are up to 2.1 billion. Of these 2.1 billion, 500 million of commercial paper easily refinanceable in the Mexican market.</p>
          <p>I'd just like to leave this part of the summary with the comment that we are in very good shape from a liquidity standpoint. I think that we have good access to markets. Mexico remains a good funding base. It is the best funding base in all of Latin America and we are the prime issuers in the Mexican market. So that's something that I think it's important to highlight.</p>
          <p>So with this, I would like to pass it over to Carlos Sequeira, so that we can get to Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Carlos. Before we start the Q&amp;A session, I'd like to ask you to please limit your questions to two at a time. Given that we have many investors connected to the call today I will take the opportunity and start the Q&amp;A session with one question. What has driven the 18 billion pesos investment in the quarter and what can we expect for the fourth quarter 2008 and 2009? And related to that what type of leverage would AMX be comfortable with going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of CapEx I think, what is happening is that you start to invest at the beginning of the year and maybe this quarter is starting to put in operation a lot of the CapEx, but the CapEx that we plan for this year of $4 billion, I think it's going to be more or less what we're going to invest if we are on track there and we feel that we're going to be in this range. For 2009, we haven't finalized our budget. So we are reviewing everything, but what I just said is that in terms of CapEx to sales, I think CapEx for next year is going to go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one thing Carlos. The number of CapEx for the quarter also includes the purchases of licenses and the renewal of concessions. We had to pay the renewal of the concession in Ecuador. And so I think that that being said we are very much in line with the budget that we had mentioned for the year. The budget for this year was $4 billion in CapEx in infrastructure and then we've had a bit more than 1 billion in second that we were to acquire in Brazil. Obviously we acquired the licenses in Panama and now the renewal of the concession in Ecuador. So that's basically what makes up the amounts we're going to be putting in our budget by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the second question which has to do with leverage I think that what we have said is, we have always wanted to remain not very distant from the one times net debt-to-EBITDA. Sometimes in exceptional circumstances which have gone beyond that when we think that we can reduce rapidly the leverage to hedge afterwards in 2002 when we allowed our ratio to go all the way up to 1.6, but right now, I mean we are at 0.78 and we do not have any reason to believe that we are going to be much higher than one at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. Operator, I guess we can open the floor for questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you. I was just hoping we could get some additional color on the operator trends in Mexico that we saw in the quarter. In particular the decline in MOUs that we saw and also the very slight drop in ARPUs and I was wondering if we should attribute this to any change in the promotions that you are running? If there's perhaps some impact from the economy behind the lower usage or just any color you can provide on what was going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, good morning. On the MOU, MOU has been up 18.6% against last year. So the MOU is 170 something it's a very good MOU comparing against all the other countries in Latin America. We declined against last quarter, because we take out some promotions that we have and they were using -- they were not being used as those type of promotions. They used it irregularly in the networks. So we're capping so those promotions and we're locking &#x2013; so these promotions we'd only use it for that type of promotions and not use it irregularly in other kinds of the network. That's mainly why the MOU goes down from last quarter. But as you see from last year, MOUs are increasing and we have a very good MOU in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In terms of the ARPU I think what you could see in the ARPU is we have a range that it's going in that range. That range is not so big. That range is good. And we don't see any trend that people is not using the phone. I think that trend has not been changed and we feel very comfortable if the ARPU -- the ARPU is not a number and that number stays forever. I think that number is going to move in that range and I think it's what is happening. So we feel comfortable, we don't see that trend is going down and I think that ARPUs in Mexico are going to be in that kind --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our next question comes from Stanley Martinez with Legal and General Investment Management. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering, if you saw any change in subscriber loading volume, subsequent to the quarter-end in markets like Mexico and Columbia and whether you saw any surprise in the mix between [audio breaks]</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[starts abruptly] ...we don't see a trend of declining in ARPU in Mexico is what I am trying to say. I don't have the number for fourth quarter, but always in the fourth quarter, it's a little bit higher than the third quarter. I don't know if it's going to be the same, a little bit lower, a little bit higher, but I don't see that the ARPU is going to have a big decline in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sequentially. Obviously. Because annually even if it's flat, you're still down pretty substantially from the prior year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember that ARPU is a function of several things, promotions, subscriber, timing. So I think we're going to remain in this range, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to get your quick thoughts on the current competitive landscape in Brazil and specifically whether the promotional activity from <mark type="inaudible" /> surrounding their launch in Sao Paulo is having an impact? Obviously that press release has been out there for a couple of weeks now. But just I was sort of curious as to whether you are seeing any incremental changes in the competitive landscape in Brazil. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's only to start, maybe one month ago in Sao Paulo. I think they are doing good. What I'm hearing is that they are doing good. We don't see any big changes in our growth in Sao Paulo specifically. And we are doing okay. And as we said, as we have a good momentum in Brazil. I think customers prefer collateral at this moment. So we feel very comfortable, but always when you have more competition, then it is going to be a little bit more tough, but we are in very good shape. We've been, through all this year, we have been the leader in net adds and I hope we stay the same for next year. <mark type="inaudible" /> an excellent competitor, and they are investing a lot. But we are not seeing any big changes in Brazil at this moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. Just a question about your subscriber adds and margins in Brazil. Q1, you had 900,000 net adds and margins were nearly 30%. Q2 was just shy of two million up in margin, with 23%, which I think you commented at the time was due to the high subscriber activity. This quarter, the stocks have increased by 30% sequentially and the margins are flat. I guess, not really getting into the drivers here, but with the change in subsidy are there any benefits from increasing scale, are data services helping the margin, any comments there would be appreciated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everything that you are saying has to be considered with that. So sometimes the promotion and the subsidies are not there, sometimes we get better pricing on the handsets, sometimes the increase on revenue is also helping us. So there's a lot and a mix of things that you have to include there. So that promotions subsidy -- sometimes subsidies are too high and the handsets are not helping you with the prices, other times they are helping you with the prices. So that's mainly and that's what you can see and the changes that you can have in the market.</p>

I think if you look at the historic EBITDA times of sales from one quarter to the other, the one before you were actually factoring <mark type="inaudible" /> we were actually having an increase for EBITDA on a year-on-year basis or maybe if you want we can look at this <mark type="inaudible" />, but basically what we have, is that the full increase in the second quarter we have had a reduction that impacted in reducing connection costs. We talked about that with those analysts after the call. This time we have not had that kind of an effect and I think that we had the margins specifically to the execution cost.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about handset subsidies going forward with the depreciation of currencies in general and handset price usually in dollars.  What would be your strategy going forward? Are you planning to keep prices and increase subsidies? Can you comment a bit about your strategy in that regards in a weaker currency environment? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Well. It's different because, first of all, not all the countries indiscernible What we're going to be very careful with the subsidies and we're going to try not to increase the price to the customers. So that's more or less what we want to do. So we have to work with the exchange rates. We have to work with the suppliers and we have do a lot of other things.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In Mexico, can you just talk about, it looks like the revenues actually went down sequentially and it seems like some of that was more due to handsets than actually service revenues, so could you just confirm that? And it looks like EBITDA also declined but could you maybe talk about what these service -- I guess the pre-tax EBITDA actually did in the quarter? Did it actually decline as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From second quarter of 2008, we increased 1.3% to third quarter of 2008. So service revenues were increased. In the total revenues we have almost the same, because the equipment revenues are declining and the equipment revenues are declining maybe because we're selling other type of handsets, maybe because we are doing some promotions. As we said we take out also some promotions. So, there's a lot of things. I don't have it right now at this moment exactly why we are declining. The equipment revenues was the -- if you are -- if you can talk with Daniel and he can give you a breakdown why the equipment revenues are declining, but in service revenue we are going up. Maybe it's a mix of the handsets. Now we are selling more of this one. We are having a better price in another one. So it depends a lot there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just following on from that point about the lower equipment sale. Is it fair to say that this quarter, we could see a jump <mark type="inaudible" /> and how should we expect that to trend going forward? My second question is on FX rate. You said that 2% of the revenue growth was because of FX third quarter. If currencies remain as they are going into the fourth quarter and into 2009, what is the kind of headwind that you can make?</p>

We want to see exactly what are going to be the increase on revenues in our operations and what's going to be the final exchange rates. We don't have it at this moment, because even the exchange rates from today than last week has been very different in Mexico and in some countries. So we have been working on that. We don't have that final number today to see exactly and Carlos can tell you about the 2% increase of the FX change.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, but also in Mexico as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't have it, but I don't think we have been increasing a lot there. But we are selling for an example in Brazil, we are selling a lot of, we call it banda ancha for the computers, the broadband and the broadband is -- we're giving less subsidies as an example for the price of the equipment is much less than a handset. So you can see a lot of different promotions and issues, there is all about mainly what's going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in that regard and I'm going back to the question that was asked before <mark type="inaudible" /> interesting to note, quarter-over-quarter in Brazil subscriber acquisition costs go up 2% but that's basically because of more gross adds. Gross adds were up 4.6% quarter-over-quarter. But our subscriber acquisition costs on a pure gross adds basis actually came down by 2.6% and that's basically what I've been saying. It's not only because of handsets now, that has the same demand now the sales of all banks that includes the PC cards <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the second question, <mark type="inaudible" /> I think that our operations that are in the handsets, which not in all places until and from a foreign exchange costs in some countries where they have local assembly. On the handsets, only on that we don't really have much foreign exchange components in our operations. Our operations are basically, domestically there are not many more inputs that are imported. So from that perspective, our operations do not stand to suffer much from the changes in the exchange rate. I think it's more of an accounting thing.</p>
          <p>Also important to note that what Daniel said, not everybody has had the same kind of movements in the currencies. We have had a bit more of a move in Brazil a bit less in Mexico, it's even less so in Columbia, it's even less so in Argentina. So, and as you know, we have a number of countries that are either dollar based or that are almost anchored to the dollar, which is El Salvador, Ecuador in Central America and <mark type="inaudible" />. So there is a good component of our operations that is not that sensitive to the exchange rate there to begin with.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is about your contract subscriber base. We have been seeing a slowdown in the growth of those countries. Is that something to do with the credit policy of AMX or you're seeing a lower demand in this customer segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to check country-by-country, Vera. I don't want to answer your question globally because I think we're doing different things in each country. But of course in some countries we have been more careful on the credit -- in the credits of the customers. In other ones we don't feel bad there. So I prefer if you want that we can discuss that country-by-country. I don't think that's something that we are moving all around Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. That's some promotions and things that we're doing in each country.</p>
          <p>But what I'm saying, in Mexico by an example, we are investing a lot in the distribution in postpaid and we're really focusing there. In Brazil we're gaining market share in postpaid. So there is some countries that we have been a little bit more cautious. In Ecuador, we have been very good also. Peru we have also improving in other ones, so why -- if you want we can break down country-by-country. In Argentina we are not doing so good. So I think it depends in each country.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Caribbean for instance, Vera, the Caribbean is a region where you already have postpaid, but very little prepaid. So in the Caribbean most of the impacts have been going more towards prepaid to expand the penetration.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Vera Rossi again. So my second question is a follow-up on the currencies. What is the tax rate on handset prices you have for Brazil specifically negotiated for the fourth quarter? And my intention is to know if the currency depreciation is going to have an impact on the fourth quarter specifically in Brazil which we saw one of the highest currency movements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think it's something that we don't disclose, because we have specific arrangements with each of the suppliers. And I don't think we have something with one only. I think we have five or six suppliers, big suppliers and with each one we have a difference there to see how we can do not to increase that. But we are going to be careful with the subsidies. Also it's going to depend a lot, Vera, on the exchange rate in that time, no? Because let's say in Mexico in the last, let's say one month is coming from 230 -- 1230 to 1350, not a big, big range there. So I think it's going to stabilize a little bit more in the next month or I don't know when and there we want to discuss also with the suppliers, what we're going to do there. We have to see also commissions. We have to see also marketing campaigns. We are reviewing a lot of things in our operations. And as I said, each country is going to have a different decision and each country is going to besides different in these campaigns, what -- as I told you we are really interested in growing, in getting market share, in some countries we are not going to lose momentum. So we are working on that, Vera.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good Morning. My first question was going back in the past and trying to see how the consumptions patterns change in an economic slowdown? Are you expecting next year, because GDP growth is going down in Mexico and elsewhere, to sell less handsets or have lower sub growth, or do you think the impact really will be more on the ARPU side of the equation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Hi, Rizwan. I think what we saw and I think that probably the best parameter that we have to guide us, in 2001 and 2002, GDP growth in Mexico, was practically nil. It was slow. And not withstanding that we saw very, very good subscriber growth. At that time, our <mark type="inaudible" /> subscriber base was growing 50% per year, something like that.</p>
          <p>But we have seen in the past and we have mentioned this also to in conference is that the subscriber growth was -- it seems to be more driven by network effect approach and those seem to be more independent of GDP growth. So, typically, what you would expect is that what we have seen is that when GDP tends to rise -- there's a little bit of an extra kick that it gives to consumption but it is geometric, when it comes down consumption doesn't fall as much because it basically it has become more of a necessity. But I think for the future the segment appeared to good in that we do expect subscriber growth to continue and we believe that subscriber growth will provide good support to revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Related to that, I mean you obviously we've seen in Mexico where you have only 10% of your total sub base as postpaid. I mean, you would think that that should be going towards the pattern we see in other countries in Latin America which is more like 20, 25% of the sub-base is postpaid? Do you think that slows down because you will be now be a lot more cautious about giving credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I don't think that because of that we can -- I think it's because in some countries because of the competition we are more aggressive on the prepaid side in other ones as they were less aggressive in the prepaid and more aggressive in the postpaid. So it's more that in Mexico by an example, we have been very, very competitive in the prepaid side. That's why there is not a huge difference between prepaid and postpaid. So that's why prepaid is growing well. That's competition and we have to live with competition and that's really what happens now. That's mainly what drives you to grow on postpaid or to grow on prepaid more there. So that's the reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last one if I may. I mean you've seen CPU rates go down and with that and the use haven't been increased as much. Do you think we have finally reached a point that price elasticity has definitely gone either neutral or negative as opposed to being positive in the past many years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand really the question. Did you say is what -- what you're saying is that the elasticity is going to finish right now is what you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The price elasticity is less than one which means you don't get as much traffic increase as reduction <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think still there is a lot of it in prices but there is a lot of services that we're going to give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again you have to look at the different markets within, reducing prices significantly in Brazil. They were relatively high related to the, compared to the countries, and we're seeing very good response there, I think that in Mexico last year it had a tremendous reduction in prices. That was also because we were about to rollout the 3G network and we were going to have that much more capacity. And so we were much more aggressive driving prices down because we knew that we wanted to see a bit much more traffic in our network. But we cannot keep on growing 55% year-on-year the profit levels as we did last year. I think that mentioned in conversations before with other investors.</p>
          <p>We think that the trend is definitely there for prices to continue to come down and we definitely believe that we're going to continue to see good response on the demand side. I think the question is quality base of the client, of rate and quality base of increase of profit and it's not going to be breakneck speed as we had last year I think in Northern Mexico. And we have seen -- we have not seen in any of the countries where are, we haven't seen it in Argentina, we haven't seen it in Peru, haven't seen in Colombia, any issues with elasticity at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As you look on your Brazilian operation, is it in the COGS or is it possible that your EBITDA margins gets to 30% in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, of course. As we grow more, the growth -- the size of the growth is less against the revenue. So I think, of course I think 30% is a good --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen that. Today a subscriber acquisition cost is high because we have had a reconciliation of subscriber growth and that tends to weigh on EBITDA margins. I think what we would expect is that as subscriber growth comes down over the next couple of years and that you will see a corresponding reduction in acquisition costs related to revenues and that should help increase margins. I think that in Brazil, in spite of its being a higher cost country than other countries, in the medium term, EBITDA margins should be able to reach the mid-30s.</p>

          <p>The operations as I was mentioning, one of the previous questions. Most of our operation is really insulated from foreign exchange. It's not &#x2013; other than the handsets which are not as issue in other countries because they are made locally. And certainly, in several of the markets, we haven't seen the swings. When it comes down, consumption doesn't fall as much, because it's basically has become more of a necessity.</p>
          <p>I think that what Daniel said in his statement appear to be is good, in that we do expect subscriber growth to continue, and we believe that subscriber growth will provide good support and revenue growth.</p>

          <p>I think again you have to look at the different markets, with reducing prices significantly in Brazil, they were relatively high relative to the other countries, and we're seeing very, very good response there. I think that in Mexico <mark type="inaudible" /> tremendous reduction in prices, but that is also because we were about to roll out the 3G network and we're going to have that much more capacity, and so we were much more aggressive driving prices down because we knew that we wanted to see that much more traffic in our network.</p>
          <p>But we cannot keep on growing 55% year-on-year the profit levels as we did last year. I think that mentioned in conversations before with other investors. We think that the trend is definitely there for prices to continue to come down and we definitely believe that we're going to continue to see good response on the demand side. I think the question is quality base of the client, of rate and quality base of increase of profit and it's not going to be breakneck speed as we had last year I think in Northern Mexico. And we have seen -- we have not seen in any of the countries where are, we haven't seen it in Argentina, we haven't seen it in Peru, haven't seen in Colombia, any issues with elasticity at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As you look on your Brazilian operation, is it in the COGS or is it possible that your EBITDA margins gets to 30% in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, of course. As we grow more, the growth -- the size of the growth is less against the revenue. So I think, of course I think 30% is a good --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen that. Today a subscriber acquisition cost is high because we have had a reconciliation of subscriber growth and that tends to weigh on EBITDA margins. I think what we would expect is that as subscriber growth comes down over the next couple of years that you will see a corresponding reduction in acquisition costs related to revenues and that should help increase margins. I think that in Brazil, in spite of its being a higher cost country than other countries, in the medium term, EBITDA margins should be able to reach the mid-30s.</p>

          <p>And I thank you. And could you give us a feel how the exchange rates that you're experiencing now could affect your fourth quarter?</p>

          <p>As you look at the exchange rate today, could you give us an idea how it might affect your fourth quarter operations?</p>

          <p>The operations as I was mentioning, one of the previous questions. Most of our operation is really insulated from foreign exchange. It's not &#x2013; other than the handsets which are not as issue in other countries because they are made locally. And certainly, in several of the market, we haven't seen these swings, if I am not misquoted. It has to do with the leverage. I have always said that we don't like to be much beyond one, but as I said earlier today, we would go potentially beyond one if we think that there is a good rationale to do that, and that's why we did it intentionally once in Brazil, we went beyond that.</p>
