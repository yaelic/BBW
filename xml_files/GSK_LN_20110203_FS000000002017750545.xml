        <plist>
          <p>And we'll get underway in just a couple seconds. I thought before we did, there is just one or two slightly unusual bits of information I wanted to share with you. The first is just to let you know who is here with me today. Because you'll see there are one or two people in here who probably don't quite look like investors and analysts, although I can assure you they all own GSK stock.</p>
          <p>So, not in any special order, but just to let you know who is here, because they may &#x2013; they will be available for to you chat to afterward in coffee room. It's always a great chance for you to meet some of our most senior management and the people who are leading some of the biggest bits of the company.</p>
          <p>So, if I work down the room, Darrel Baker, who is the Head of our Respiratory Development Organization for our advanced respiratory inhaled products and you have seen announcements on that today. In front of Darrel, we've got Eddie Gray who is the President of our European Operations. Just here, I have got Moncef Slaoui who many of you know the Head of our R&amp;D Global Operations. Back into the middle there, I have got Patrick Vallance who essentially runs all of Pharma R&amp;D within Moncef's shop.</p>
          <p>In front of Patrick, I have Deirdre Connelly who is the President of our U.S. Operations. David Redfern who runs our M&amp;A Operations and also now looks after our Stiefel dermatology business and is also &#x2013; will be taking over the Chairmanship of our other specialty businesses going forward. We've got Simon Dingemans in the front here who is our newly announced CFO taking over at the end of March, and of course, I have got Julian Heslop here as well. I don't think I've missed anybody out.</p>
          <p>The second bit of news really affects Julian. As you know, Julian is retiring at the 31st of March and I just think right from the beginning, just in case it all goes horribly wrong for the next couple of hours, now would be a good time for me to acknowledge in front of this audience who have got to know Julian I think very well over many years, that this is his last session. He became CFO at GSK on April the 1st, 2005. It turned out not to be an April Fool's joke, and he has done a fantastic job since and In fact I think this is your 24th quarter.</p>
          <p>CFO's at GSK measure their tenure in quarters. That's because of you guys. So, anyway, it's obviously great to have Julian here by my side again today, but I just thought absolutely important to mark that milestone both for you, Julian, and for the team at GSK and for the company as a whole. You have been a terrific support for us over the last several years, both as CFO and of course also as Controller before that</p>
          <p>So, let me get on with the rest of the day. Let me talk to you a little bit about what is happening at GSK and the way we'll play this, I'll present really for the first half and then Julian will come and give you a summary of 2010 and some sense of margins and things going forward. Before I get into the slides though and you will see the book is mercifully thin in terms of slides &#x2013; before I get into the detail of the slides and given you some feel going forward, I want to pick up on one or two key points in terms of what we've announced today in the results.</p>
          <p>2010 was clearly a very strange year in some ways because you had this continued delivery and execution of the strategy we've been focused on since I took over in 2007, but that has been, to some degree, masked by the events which have come from outside of the company. At the sales line, the loss of the Valtrex business obviously to generics and the loss of Avandia to regulatory interventions combined with the washout of pandemic vaccine and Relenza and then at the earnings line, of course, the legal charge that we took during 2010 and the two slices clearly has a very big impact on that reported earnings charge.</p>
          <p>I just want to make a couple of comments particularly about the legal charge. The rest I'll refer to as I go through going forward. Clearly, what we're trying to do at GSK is deal with some very long-standing litigation. We've made great progress on that litigation over the last two or three years, and as I've made clear before, large chunks of our significant litigation has been really put behind us, leaving behind two significant areas, the Avandia product liability cases and, of course, the federal investigation, so-called Colorado case, which has been running now for seven, eight years or so and covers a period going back about ten years.</p>
          <p>So what we've been trying to do is obviously get crystallization around those exposure for the company, but just like everything else, trying to get closure and certainty as rapidly as we can and of course, as effectively as we can from a shareholder perspective. Now, of course, these numbers are big. None of us are happy about the numbers that we've had to announce, but it's important for you to, I think, understand how we do this.</p>
          <p>We, both Julian and I, in particular, are very focused on trying to ensure that at any given quarter, we are providing sufficiently to cover all of our legal exposures, all cases, for what we believe to be the most likely costs of settlement or finalization of those cases. And that's when from time to time, as new facts come along, we have to adjust our provisioning. Now the adjustment we had to make two or three weeks ago was driven essentially through a change in trend of the number of cases that we had seen on Avandia through the period of August, September, October of last year, particularly associated with a lot of press in the U.S., a doubling of advertising by plaintiff's attorneys and the actions of FDA during the third and fourth quarter of 2010 in terms of restricting the product. That, of course, created a lot of noise and it created a change in the trend of the number of cases which came through.</p>
          <p>As we said previously, we spent the end of Q3 getting those cases validated if you will. Are they real?  Aren't they real?  Is there anything there or not?  And that's what led to us then to have to review our provision at the beginning of this year. We obviously understand that was not welcome news by anybody. I think, though, it's really important to just put it into context. The context being trying to close off litigation in the most efficient and effective way possible and we're obviously striving to do that as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>We have continued to make extremely good progress in doing that on a variety of cases and we continue to make good progress in the Avandia product liability cases. We're now in a position where we have settled more than the majority of the cases that we're aware of, and as you know, in the provision we set, we put in there an expectation of what we thought might come even cases we weren't currently aware or specifically we put an expectation in there to try and pick up any potential new cases that might come along.</p>
          <p>But it's fair to say also that it's impossible for to us provide for the unknown unknowns. We can provide for what we think is there, what we know is there, and what we believe is a reasonable expectation. So I just want to put that into context. None of us are happy about it, but we are working very hard and we do think it's in the interest of shareholders to get this crystallized and resolved as fast as possible just as we did with all the other pieces of litigation in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start now and really get into the business and talk to you a little about what is going on at GSK, because despite those headline noises, which in many ways, although substantial, are clearly one-off impacts on the business. I think the real key is to focus on what is going on in the substance of this organization. And the substance of this organization, things are going pretty well in terms of the way in which GSK is operating. I'm going to very quickly recap where we're up to in terms of our strategy, what we're building and then I'm going to give you a little bit more depth in terms of some of the things which have changed at GSK and why we believe we are absolutely well positioned going forward in what is obviously a super challenging environment.</p>
          <p>There's no question that this environment is a tough one and you only have to look at every other company's report in the last two or three weeks and you get very much the same sense of people being under pressure in this sector and it's been that way for quite a while, obviously. What's key is which companies are going to emerge from this period first and which companies are going to get the balance of tailwinds and headwinds back in their favor having had a period where obviously the headwinds have overwhelmed the tailwinds for many of us in the past.</p>
          <p>Now, three years ago, we set out what our view of the environment would be and bluntly speaking, very little has happened that we didn't anticipate. Some of it's happened more quickly and some of it might have happened a degree sharper or blunter, but very little has happened that we didn't anticipate in terms of pricing, in terms of the development of the emerging market pharma businesses, all of those things were very much behind the strategy we laid out three years ago, strategy focused on delivering a business which would deliver sustainable sales growth, an R&amp;D operation which would fix the economics of R&amp;D and deliver products of value to patients and to payers, and a strategy which would simplify GSK takeout costs and allow that cost to be reinvested behind growth opportunities, all focused on delivering a greater return to our shareholders as we went forward.</p>
          <p>That was the strategy we laid out based on the environment that we had. If we look today at the business that we have, what is GSK?  So, we can talk about GSK in all sorts of labels. Actually, what is GSK?  It's a company which essentially has presences or products in four distinctly important areas of healthcare. We have differentiated pharmaceutical products, medicines and vaccines in the developed market, our U.S. and European business in Japan, of course. We have built up a very substantial emerging market business by getting the right prices into the evolving emerging markets and we either are or we are very close to being the biggest volume supplier of medicines and vaccines to the emerging markets of all companies, which is really a striking achievement for a branded pharmaceutical company. Our volumes in the emerging markets either are the largest selling or they're very close to being the largest selling of anybody in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We have a very broad vaccine business that we have built up and of course, we have an excellent, fast-growing consumer healthcare business. Those are the four portfolios that this business really have. As a corporation, what we look like is essentially those businesses of growth that you have today, where we have been invested in consumer in Japan, our developed businesses, all of those businesses deliver new growth surrounding a core pharma operation where the future obviously depends on the pipeline. So we talk about the pipeline at GSK being an option. Because you've got all of the growth coming from these other businesses and yet, in the center of the organization is this reengineered R&amp;D operation delivering a stronger pipeline, as you have seen today, with great potential, very much coming to the front of our minds in terms of the timings when these products have the potential to come to market. That's essentially the business.</p>
          <p>All of that business wrapped in a set of disciplines around efficient allocation of capital and resources to our growth businesses, a really strict discipline on looking for improved return on investment, and a real commitment to make R&amp;D efficient and to solve the problem which has blighted the industry for the last 10 years or 15 years. So what's actually changed?  That's kind of the story of what we are.</p>
          <p>A lot has changed in the last two and a half or three years. This slide just gives you a little bit of a sense of that and then, obviously, a variety of measures. I'm just going to quickly touch on them. Turnover, these numbers exclude pandemic, so we're not trying to big up our performance through the pandemic impact of the last couple of years. Excluding pandemic, sales turnover for the group up from &#xA3;22 billion to just over &#xA3;27 billion. In the same period, the group lost &#xA3;5 billion of turnover to generics and to Avandia sales because of regulatory intervention. So that net number of &#xA3;5 billion actually hides a gross number of &#xA3;10 billion, which shows you the strength of the organization sales capacity, but it really emphasizes the degree of head and tailwinds that we have been dealing with in the last few years.</p>
          <p>So a good sales growth performance, of course, muffled by the impact of generics and Avandia, but those impacts now rapidly waning, and you can see during 2010, that underlying sales performance, only excluding Avandia, Valtrex and pandemic products, plus 4.5%.</p>
          <p>We set out right from the beginning to make this business a more sustainable business, less exposed to volatility of patent expirations. What did that mean?  It means we need to have less exposure to the classic businesses in the high-priced developed markets, the white pill Western markets. So, you can see over the last three years that exposure has gone down from 40% to 25%. I will talk more about that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>We have been reallocating resources rapidly across the organization. 51% of our SG&amp;A now spent in the investment areas, emerging markets, Japan, consumer, vaccines; rapid movement of money and investment away from the developed businesses into the developing businesses. That's what the restructuring program has done. Huge reductions in spend in the developed markets, big investments in the growth markets.</p>
          <p>You might be interested to know that 62% of our pharmaceutical sales force is now outside of America and Europe. The vast majority now of our sales force organization for pharmaceutical sits in the fast-growing markets. Both Europe and America have reduced their sales forces over the last three years by roughly 50%. Very significant change in the structuring of our primary sales operation.</p>
          <p>Our head count, down, you can see there. What that hides is that the actual gross head count for GSK has come down by 22,000 people, and we've hired back the delta here. So, this is a consequence of very significant head count reduction in the developed businesses, the traditional businesses, the above-country operations, and then a hired back program in vaccines, emerging markets and consumer.</p>
          <p>Support functions completely transformed. We used to be a company of hundreds of subsidiaries, each with their own operations. We're now a company moving rapidly towards a single, central core support organization. We just created now a formal core business services in which all of our transactional operations go. We're well on our way to putting in place all of the systems to facilitate that, and as you can imagine, that has a capacity to drive out not just cost savings, because you do things once instead of 100 times, but also drives standardization, efficiency, greater control, eliminate risk in the organization; a massive cultural transformation, well on the way to being completed.</p>
          <p>Sales of new products, dramatically up. &#xA3;1.7 billion in 2010. 2010 over 2009, up 36%. Significant increase in rate. Again, just to make sure you don't think I'm exaggerating this, this excludes any contribution from pandemic vaccine, which obviously was about a third of a billion pounds. But this is the ongoing sales number, up 36% for the year. If you adjust, by the way, for the Rotarix temporary suspension which is a major new product, of course, then that plus 36% would have been plus 54%. So, there's a very good growth momentum behind our new products.</p>
          <p>Pipeline itself continues to look very strong. I'll talk more about pipeline shortly, but what you can see in the pipeline is a very significant strength, advancement, progression, low rates of attrition, high rates of novelty, high rates of differentiation, high rates of potential not just to improve patients' well-being but to meet payors' needs in the way that they are currently being expressed.</p>
          <p>You can see a big shift in terms of how we emphasize both internal and external discovery operations. You can see here, the number of external biotech companies we collaborate with in our discovery operations. Today, about 50% of what we do in discovery is outside of the company, about 50% of what we do is inside of the company.</p>
          <p>And you can see very significant continued cash generation. Before the legal charge &#x2013; legal payouts in 2010, &#xA3;8.8 billion pounds of cash generated by the company. Both through robust operations, but also obviously through the impact of a very focused working capital program, which allowed to us reduce our working capital by &#xA3;1.3 billion or by &#xA3;700 million if you simply exclude the pandemic receivable over the period '09 to '10. Very significant, allowing us, despite all of the various outflows, the dividend, acquisitions and paying &#xA3;2 billion out on legal last year, we were still able to reduce net debt by &#xA3;600 million.</p>
          <p>Very good evidence, I think, of the organic cash generation, strength of the company, and also the impact we've had on being able to be much more efficient in terms of working capital. And now, of course, I'm very pleased that we've been able to continue to increase the dividend today by another 7% to 65 pence.</p>
          <p>Now let's just look at one or two of these investment business, because I think it's worthwhile just focusing on exactly what we're doing in these marketplaces. So emerging markets, it's a place where we identified great growth opportunity, it's a place where we've invested, and this is what's happened. So over the periods '02 to '06, we averaged a CAGR growth rate in the EMs of 7%; we're now averaging 14%.</p>
          <p>As you have seen in the results today, we're actually now much faster than that. So, we are seeing continued acceleration of our emerging market business, broad-based across all the geographies, and we've used the bolt-on acquisition strategy to fill out the gaps that we had in key bits of the geography around the world. Particularly in Latina, somewhat in China and particularly in the Middle East. Those have given us now a very, very good platform for emerging markets. Strong growth coming from all of those businesses, very nicely balanced across the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of how we look at where we spend money, interesting to look in the emerging markets. On an ongoing investment basis, if we look at our businesses in the EMs, we range from, for every pound spent, from worst case, &#xA3;1.50 returned in 12 months, to best case &#xA3;3 returned within 12 months, depending on how developed the business is. So, the bigger our business, the bigger our platform, like in India, where we're able to invest on the back of great presence and leverage, we get very high returns. Even in the markets where we have not got that strength necessarily, you can see you still get extremely healthy fast returns.</p>
          <p>Stiefel, obviously, the most significant acquisition we've made makes us the world's leading dermatology company. We've been very pleased with this acquisition. We're ahead of our targets. We're ahead of our targets on taking costs out of this business. About &#xA3;60 million ahead of where we expected to be at this point in time. We are absolutely in line with our expectations for the return rates of this acquisition. I think it's also maybe a surprise to some of you when I tell that you that the operating margin for this business is actually 42%. And when you exclude amortization, it's 47%. So this is a very robust part of the business. It's a profitable part of the business, growing part of the business and of course, it has great application, not just in the developed world but also particularly in the emerging markets and as you know, we also believe in the future in the consumer space.</p>
          <p>U.S. pharma, probably a part of the business we haven't talked about so much in the last few years. But U.S. pharma is absolutely turning the corner in terms of its future. What we can see in that business, first of all, like everybody in the U.S., we're having to deal with tremendous challenges from the environment. U.S. is changing very rapidly, the way customers are structured, who owns the customers, who controls the customers, where the decisions are taken, is changing extremely rapidly. The whole industry is trying to figure out a new model to fit with that.</p>
          <p>I think we've made great progress on a number of the dimensions of that model. So, our new payor model, how we work with payers, how we contract with payers, how we price protect payers, all of those dynamics are changing the way that we're able to acquire business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our specialty organizations are already deployed and we're in the process now of deploying a new general pharmaceutical approach. This business last year, underlying, only excluding pandemic, Avandia and Valtrex grew 3%, that includes the impact of healthcare reform which was $470 million. So, you can see that the U.S. business is back to growth. It's under &#x2013; it's underreported because of those same big hits I described earlier. And if you look at the 80% of the business, which are the promoted products, the places we actually invest our energies, that business was up 8% during 2010. So the U.S. business is turning the corner. It's clearly still a marketplace where innovation will get rewarded and we're starting to see competitiveness pick up.</p>
          <p>I was particularly delighted last year when GSK was voted by the physicians in all the surveys to be the number one sales force, and I think given all the changes and all the obvious noise about whether change is going to demoralize or destabilize the organization, when we changed the incentive comp system for our U.S. sales force to then be credited by the customers as being the best sales force, I think gives a real vote of confidence to the leadership in the U.S. and also the way in which we have been able to develop this organization into a much more mature, thoughtful organization fit for the future.</p>
          <p>Our consumer business, as you have seen, continues to perform very well. Same analysis as the emerging markets. Before we started ramping up investment, growing a CAGR of about 3%. Since we've ramped up investment, growing a CAGR of 7%. Again, rate of returns here are fantastic. 20% rate of return on R&amp;D. That's why we have been ramping up our R&amp;D spending consumer. To give you an idea, during 2010, the amount of money we spent on project R&amp;D in consumer was up 17%. Very significant increase because we know innovation drives this business forward. We're good at it and we get great returns when we make that. So, our return rates in consumer absolutely demand that we continue to ramp up our investments in this area.</p>
          <p>Great example of that would be the new Sensodyne product. As you know, Sensodyne is one of our fastest growing products, it's actually our biggest product in consumer. Grew last year 18% worldwide. It's really taken the fight, if you will, to the oral care giant companies, some of whom have tried to compete with their own versions. We then obviously try to compete back with new, improved versions of Sensodyne like Sensodyne Rapid Relief and it was very impressive last year to see that we were able to launch Sensodyne Rapid Relief in 50 countries over a period of six months.</p>
          <p>It shows you the global scale of this company in terms of consumer healthcare, innovation, great brands, and when we get that all lined up together we do a terrific job in the consumer business. That's why we've made the decision to find a way to make that even more focused. If you look at our current consumer business, 90% of the current turnover is in the top 15 or so global brands, and the emerging markets. That's where all the growth is in this business. You're either in a big, global brand like a Sensodyne or a Panadol or a Lucozade or a Horlicks where you can really leverage platforms across multiple countries or you're in an India or a China where the growth is just phenomenal and you're able to access great distribution synergy with our pharmaceutical business. That leaves 10% of the business.</p>
          <p>That 10% of the business is basically very nice brands, but they tend to be more regional or maybe one country or two countries or three countries, and they tend to be OTC. They tend to be smaller, and they don't have, for us, the focus which would give you the growth. Somebody else, I'm sure, could make that business grow better than we could. We've got a better place to focus our attention on those priority brands and on the emerging markets. That's why we announced today our intention to divest ourselves of this portfolio of 10% of the business, plus or minus &#xA3;500 million pounds worth of sales. Our goal is to get that transaction done obviously as soon as we can some time, hopefully, before the end of this year depending on buyer interest and then the intention is to return the proceeds of that transaction to shareholders as soon as the transaction is completed.</p>
          <p>I think, again, it's an absolutely appropriate thing for us to do to try and find ways to really release and visibly release the fast growth that sits inside this consumer business and this is an important way for us to do it. Now, if we just look at 2010 for the overall business. I have mentioned already that the underlying sales growth for the business last year excluding Avandia, pandemic and Valtrex was 4.5% positive. And this just shows you where the hits and the gains are. You can see the first three columns in the &#x2013; on the red columns coming down on the waterfall basically show the three products which I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>If you look then to the right, you can see the impact of other generics. So this is all the other rats and mice generics going on around the business, and then you see where the growth is coming from. I want you to just note we have not excluded price from this. Remember, last year, we took $470 million of price hit in the U.S. through healthcare reform and in Europe, we took about 2.5% price hit through the various business as usual/austerity price cuts which the European governments inflicted on us and you can see that despite that, we got very good growth across the rest of our business, and that's really the underlying 4.5%, and as we've said in the release, we expect to be able to continue underlying sales growth during 2011.</p>
          <p>As we go through toward the end of 2011, obviously, the washouts of the three discontinuing business comes to an end and obviously, their underlying sales growth will start to then look like reported growth going forward. So we clearly are coming to a point where visibility on the future of the company becomes clearer and we're able to be a little more confident about how things are going to line up as some of these big pieces drop out of the mix. If we look at some of the key pieces of that global performance, particularly, the pharma business, I think the first thing I'd say on this slide is you have got Europe delivered a very solid, flat performance but very solid against a lot of price pressure. Remember, a low single-digit growth environment in any case. Good, solid performance. Look at the rest. All other regions growing at an underlying level. I've already talked about the U.S</p>
          <p>Very good performance. Very encouraged by the initial launches of the new products, two of which are in the specialty oncology area. Votrient in particular starting very well. Jalyn, our combination product of tamsulosin and Avodart starting very well, certainly in the top five or six launches that we have seen in the U.S. from the whole industry in the last two or three years. So, we are encouraged by that. The American business, as I have said already, starting to strengthen, has been able to deliver that performance while absorbing tremendous price hits from the government's Health-care Reform Act. You can see in the emerging markets, 20% up, &#xA3;3.3 billion now. Growing ahead of the marketplace, strong growth, particularly in areas where we have been able to add in businesses.</p>
          <p>I just thought I would mention the BMS and UCB acquisitions. These are now growing on an annualized rate, not &#x2013; so this is on a pro-forma basis, if you will, 28%. You can see, those are businesses that we acquired and we've been able to drive really superior growth for them as they have come into the business. Very strong performance on volume. Excellent evidence of our price sensitivity work that we have been doing where we have been able to cut prices and drive absolutely impressive and dramatic improvements of volume.</p>
          <p>Vaccines, of course, is a key part of that business. Japan has continued to be a tremendous deliverer and this, of course, excludes the enormous pandemic contracts that we won in Japan and were delivered during the year but even so, very strong continued performance. We have a series of brands which doubled their market share during the year, and we continue to be in a position where we're able to deliver very significant innovation to the marketplace. We launched Xyzal. This is the new antihistamine, levocetirizine, licensed from UCB that we market in Japan. We launched it in October and by December, we already had 11% market share. Very effective company gain in share. Three years ago, I stood up and said we were going to launch somewhere around 40 products in the next three or four years.</p>
          <p>We have launched the vast majority of that. Of course, some more to come. I'm delighted to tell you that today we expect to launch another 42 products in Japan in the next four years. So, that bolus of products that we talked about two or three years ago actually isn't a bolus. It's a level which at least through 2015, we expect to be in a position where we can launch somewhere between 8 and 9 new products or major new indications every single year in Japan. That is the perfect moment to be doing that because the pricing regime in Japan as many of you know has changed to be much more pro-innovation. We're in a very good position to benefit from that and during 2010, the inflicted price cut from the government in the normal biannual system which was influenced by the new scheme was only 50% of GSK took a price reduction, only 50% of the average pharmaceutical company because of the innovative profile that we have.</p>
          <p>So, all regions performing well. All performing well against their environment and underlying level and as these three businesses wash out, those performances we expect to reflect through. We've talked a lot about trying to create a business which is not so vulnerable to some of the volatility, the non-white pill Western market. Obviously, business in the emerging markets has a different emphasis, but just look at where the business is coming from in terms of form and formulation. You can see here 60% of our business now comes from non-white pills. Add onto that the business you have in the emerging markets, that's what gets to you the 75% of business which is non-white pill, non-Western market. You can see here, continued sustainable growth in all of those areas.</p>
          <p>Pipeline. Pipeline continues to be a major focus for us. This is an area where we have continuously emphasized the efficiency, but also the quality of decision making. I'm delighted that during 2010, we were able to put 10, these 10, new assets into Phase III development. Of course, we continue to have around 30 assets in full development. We had no attrition last year in our advanced development. We just terminated almorexant in the last week. During 2010, we had no attrition in the 12 month period.</p>
          <p>It's a very strong performance. The maintenance of that advanced pipeline looks very, very good. We have 30 in Phase III or registration. Twenty of those thirty are new chemical entities or novel vaccines. So very significantly differentiated and during the next two years, 15 of the 30 will report out important Phase III data. Now, it's a drug business. So we know some of these drugs and vaccines won't make it, but you can see both the scale, the progression, the differentiation and the novelty of this pipeline really adds up to potential. It really adds up to something which over the next couple of years, I hope we will be able to crystallize into what that potential truly is.</p>
          <p>All of that performance has not come by throwing more and more money into the mix. As you know, R&amp;D as a percent of sales is broadly stable, around 14%. We would expect that 14% to carry on into the future, but if you actually look at what's going on in this part of our organization, what we're actually doing is we're spending less on our pharma R&amp;D operation, more and more efficiency. We're releasing that money to increase spend in vaccines, increase spend in consumer, increase spend in dermatology.</p>
          <p>So, pharma is getting more efficient, both on nominal and on real terms, probably substantially ahead of the numbers you're seeing. How are we doing that?  Very sharp focus on rate of return. Very sharp focus on the levers that can drive that rate of return. Can we drive down attrition?  Can we make better, high quality decisions early, being more ruthless at the beginning, create more accountability on decision making through the smaller units that we've created?</p>
          <p>Some of the output of that; almost a third reduction in head count for R&amp;D over the last few years, down to about 11,300. A third reduction in space. We closed six R&amp;D centers in the last 12 months alone. Late-stage development where most of the value sits in the advanced pipe line, 60% of our resources now go to the late development, much less spent on earlier discovery. Of course, we still have a good discovery operation, but we want to emphasize the delivery of the late stage pipeline. 37 internal Discovery Performance Units that Patrick created and built and led, and 54 external biotech companies who we have optionality over their drug developmental programs and assets.</p>
          <p>And in the last three years, something I think Moncef should be very proud of, Biopharm now accounts for 20% of our clinical pipeline as we have really come from nowhere to have a very substantial biopharmaceutical set of assets both in advanced, medium and early development, and of course, they represent a very different profile of risk. So, that's a quick summary of where we've been. In terms of how we see the future going, clearly from a sales growth perspective, underlying sales momentum, we've said we expect to continue during 2011. It's obviously going to be masked by the Avandia, Valtrex and pandemic events particularly in the first half of the year, but as they wash through, their underlying sales growth is going to shine through in the business we fully anticipate. We of course expect that to translate to reported growth in 2012.</p>
          <p>Operating and financial leverage, we continue to focus on ways we can drive out more savings. &#xA3;1.7 billion already saved, on track for the &#xA3;2.2 billion target in 2012. Strong cash generation, I've already mentioned. Clearly, very effective working capital program, and we've obviously been focused how we can divest noncore asset, because what's the point of GSK holding assets which aren't adding to our growth, aren't adding to our mission.</p>
          <p>So, last year, for example, we divested Wellbutrin, we divested &#x2013; in America, we divested Boniva last year as well. This year, you have seen us divest Zovirax cream rights in America and you have also seen us divest our remaining shareholding in Quest. All of those things absolutely part of what we think is the right thing to do when the value looks good, when we think the value is right, then we're going to divest ourselves of those noncore assets, and that's exactly what we have been focused on doing.</p>
          <p>I think just on the operating and financial leverage points, also important to make just a couple of comments about margin. If we go forward into 2011, two things, I think. One is that because of the effect of pandemic flu, Valtrex and Avandia, actually, quarter-to-quarter margins are going to be a bit all over the place because you're going to have some periods where on a year-to-year basis, you are going to see some very strange sorts of numbers.</p>
          <p>So, I think there will be probably a bit more volatility than normal and then as a general point, because you've got this block of sales washing out from '10 to '11, we expect a temporary dip in the operating margin in 2011 of about 1%. Now, that's not because we're increasing investment. It's because those sales have disappeared and didn't have any costs attached to them. So, as those sales drop out of the mix, you are left with two choices.</p>
          <p>You either let them drop out of the mix and you have a temporary dip in the margin or you have to go taking cost out somewhere else which has nothing to do with the businesses you have lost. That would clearly not make any sense if you believe those other investments are driving your growth elsewhere. It makes no sense at all to cut investments in consumer, simply because Avandia is not there in 2011 when it was there in 2010. So that's what drives that 1% reduction in operating margin.</p>
          <p>We then expect in '12, '13 and '14 for the operating margin to recover quite well going forward into the future as everything I have just described starts to click in. Of course, sales growth, leverage, drive-off cash, dividend return to shareholders, I think many of you, and I certainly had lots of conversations with the investors where lots of people weren't quite sure what the word progressive meant. We always felt like we knew what progressive dividend meant. Not everybody else quite knew exactly what we meant by progressive dividend. I think we've tried to sharpen that up today by saying our priority is to grow the dividend year in, year out. So, hopefully, we have taken away any ambiguity about what the word progressive means and our commitment is to grow the dividend and today, as well, we're announcing the start of a new share buyback program, long-term, steady share buyback program, which we believe is an appropriate moment to do it.</p>
          <p>Now, why are we doing this now?  Very simple. One, we're starting to get real clarity about where we think the future of the group is. Two, we're generating a lot of cash and 2010 was a great example of that and three, it's clear that there are less bolt-on acquisitions that meet our financial hurdles than there were two years ago. Last year in 2010, we spent about a third on acquisitions of what we spent in 2009. That wasn't because we weren't looking for lots of acquisitions, but there weren't acquisitions which fitted our goal, our targets and met our financial hurdles, so our anticipation is that there will be less acquisitions, therefore more cash available to return to shareholders and hence, now is the right time to start this program and I think it's exactly the right thing for us to do.</p>
          <p>So, obviously, what we're looking to do is now come through this period we've been in for the last few years. It's a new phase for the company. It's a phase where we start to see the underlying sales growth come to the surface over the next year or so. We believe we can continue the very good track record we've got of operating and financial leverage and discipline. Of course, that's going to drive dividend, and now we're making it clear, it's going to drive further superior returns to shareholders through all the cash generation that we have and the shareholder return that we believe we can then deliver. With that, I'm going to hand over to Julian to give you more detail of the performance in 2010 and then we'll have Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. I want to start by looking at a summary of the financial performance for 2010. You can see that sales were down 1% at constant exchange rates and I intend to focus on CER for all the movements that I talk about, although, albeit at actual rates, sales are pretty much the same as the previous year. You can see if you look at EPS that we clearly suffered from a &#xA3;4 billion legal charge and that compared to just under &#xA3;600 million in the year before.</p>
          <p>What we have done on the line below is to show you the impact of eliminating that legal charge and to the right, you'll see an 11% decline in earnings on that adjusted basis. That 11% reflects 6 percentage points of lower other operating income and 5 percentage points which reflect the sales decline, the slightly higher cost of good margin and lower SG&amp;A costs, but net, net, net it all averaged out at about five percentage points decline.</p>
          <p>You can see the four legal settlements that we generate another &#xA3;1 billion of free cash flow. And that free cash flow was enough to pay those legal settlements, to pay out about, just about &#xA3;600 million on acquisitions to cover the dividend and also to reduce net debt for the year. If you look at that chart, it emphasizes the diversified business that we have. If you turn to the left, you can see good growth from the emerging markets from Asia-Pac and from consumer healthcare, and if you eliminate, as Andrew has done, flu pandemic, Avandia and Valtrex, you lose about a couple of percentage points of growth on emerging markets in Asia-Pac, clearly, no impact on consumer healthcare.</p>
          <p>The decline in ViiV reflects competition to mature brands only partially offset by both the acquisition of the Pfizer brands into the joint venture and also organic growth from those brands. Turning to the right of that chart, you can see declines of 11% and 6% in the U.S. and Europe and as Andrew said to you, again, stripping out pandemic, Avandia and Valtrex, that becomes plus 3% in the U.S. despite healthcare reform and despite the loss of Boniva and broadly flat in Europe.</p>
          <p>I think this chart shows nicely the impact of those three products that we keep referring back to. I think there's a number of points on this chart. First of all, the underlying growth. If you strip those three out gives the 4.5%. I think that's the first point. And I think the second point is &#xA3;1.4 billion of sales lost in 2010 from those products. I think the third important point is in 2011, we expect minimal pandemic and Avandia sales and we expect a further significant decline in Valtrex sales.</p>
          <p>Overall there, 4.5% underlying growth. If we switch to pharmaceuticals and we focus solely on pharmaceuticals and exclude consumer healthcare, we see a 4% underlying growth with clearly that product categorization that you see above. Advair, 2% up overall. Flat in the U.S., up 2% in Europe, up 16% in emerging markets, up 10% in the rest of the world. If you turn to vaccines, up 10%. Half that growth came from Synflorix. Most vaccine brands grew during the year, probably the only exception being Rotarix whose temporary suspension clearly caused a decline as it recovers. You can see strong growth in dermatologicals, that's organic growth at 6%, stripping out the acquisition effect, really reflecting the broader product portfolio, but also the really disciplined skilled management that the Stiefel people brought to us improving our overall portfolio.</p>
          <p>You can see strong growth from Avodart, Lovaza and Arixtra, and even encouragingly from brands like Tykerb and Veramyst, newer products who each quarter, grow and are beginning to be quite significant in terms of the overall sales mix. Inevitably, we have a portfolio here down 3% which brings the overall growth down, but net 4% overall.</p>
          <p>New products are vital to both the pharmaceutical business and the consumer healthcare business. It's obvious to state that the pipeline is critical. Andrew has taken you through that. But you can see these products make an increasing contribution to our business. And importantly, it's quite a diversified contribution. We're not talking about one or two products here. We're talking about a number of products and that diversification makes the business much more robust in the future and much less vulnerable to surprises.</p>
          <p>If you look at the consumer healthcare business, you can on the left see strong growth in our international markets. You can see the impact of challenging economic times in our U.S. and European businesses. If you look to the right, you can see category analysis. You can see strong growth from nutritional healthcare and from oral care. Oral care strongly driven by Sensodyne; nutritional healthcare strongly driven by Horlicks in international markets. Slightly lower growth in the OTC area, there good growth from our analgesics business but reduced by lower alli growth to give 3% overall.</p>
          <p>Now to the P&amp;L. Cost of goods 26.1%, pretty much in line with what I told you a year ago and our expectation is that we'll deliver around about a 26% cost of goods in 2011. If you look at SG&amp;A, I've made two points. Firstly, SG&amp;A caused an aggregate down 2% and that's despite increasing the amortization arising from acquisitions which get reported in that line by about &#xA3;80 million during the year. So, that &#xA3;80 million adds another 1% to growth, so a 2% saving despite that. However, margin 29.5%, slightly above where I guided you, really, I think to Andrew's point, the denominator was lower than we originally thought as we were depressed clearly by Avandia and other matters. If you look a year forward to 2011, I expect SG&amp;A excluding legal as a percentage of sales to be around 30.5% of sales.</p>
          <p>Legal, clearly, &#xA3;4 billion, much higher than the previous year. This tracks on the left 2009 actual, on the right, the 2010 actual. &#xA3;578 million of costs taken out of the business. That's slightly flatter by &#xA3;20 million of currency benefit, but that's pretty immaterial. So, a lot of costs coming out of GSK. In America, we took 11% of costs out. In Europe, we took 11% of costs out. We reinvested behind investment markets &#xA3;176 million there and we also clearly had a full-year impact from Stiefel but we also reinvested in our total derms portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, I think we in a sense had the best of both worlds. We saved money but reinvested for the future, but ultimately, returned profit to the bottom line at the end of the day. Turning to R&amp;D, R&amp;D tracked very much in line with expectations. 14% of sales, flat year on year. Guidance for 2011, 14% broadly around the 14% mark. If you look at other operating income, remember in 2009, we had the Wellbutrin XL sale. We had the slightly odd accounting gain on the formation of ViiV, &#xA3;296 million noncash gain which we talked about last year.</p>
          <p>We had a much lower level of other operating income in 2010. About &#xA3;300 million, just under &#xA3;300 million of our &#xA3;493 million is royalties. So, sort of sustainable royalty stream we have seen over the past few years. Looking forward to 2011, I expect around &#xA3;600 million pounds of other operating income in 2011, excluding the consumer healthcare divestment. That's not in that number. Overall, operating profit depressed as you can see by the legal charge. We've expressed operating margin excluding legal and excluding other operating income and we do believe that's probably the way to look at the business.</p>
          <p>Legal clearly very high in 2010, very low in 2009 relative to 2010, and therefore, the distorting the margin. Other operating income reflecting whether there are noncore assets to sell. It doesn't really make sense to talk about margin including it given its volatility. Strip them both out, 2009 to 2010, a 0.3% drop in the margin. This is the margin that Andrew talked about when he said he expects a 1 percentage point drop in that margin in 2011. It's that margin there.</p>
          <p>Interest as you can see from the chart, pretty steady year on year at around about the &#xA3;710 million mark. An important point here, where we have cash on deposit, we earn in today's financial environment very, very low rates of interest. So, sadly, it doesn't make much difference as you adjust that cash balance in terms of the interest payable, and my expectation for 2011 is you'll see, again, a broadly similar interest charge for 2011, much as you did in 2010 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Profit on disposal of interest in associates, high in '09 when we sold some Quest shares and low in 2010, we hardly did anything. In 2011, we'll report approximately &#xA3;600 million profit on the disposal of the Quest stake which we executed a few days ago. With it will come &#xA3;350 million of tax because the base value for tax purposes is much lower than the book value for accounting purposes. Hence, what will seem to be a very high rate of tax on the book profit. Net impact on earnings, 250 million.</p>
          <p>Share of associates and joint venture profits, you can't sell Quest on the one hand and associate account for profit on the other into the future. &#xA3;79 million was reported as part of that &#xA3;81 million from accounting for our Quest equity stake. That's gone. Profit before tax exactly as you see it.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, tax rate of 34.3%, high in 2010 because we had the low tax relief on the legal charges of about 15%. That brought the overall tax rate up. If we look at 2011, we expect an effective tax rate of 29.5%. There's two elements of that effective tax rate. First of all, there's 27% on the underlying business. That is what we would call our underlying tax rate, and then because we sold the Quest shares, because have this relatively high profit on book profit, the tax on the book profit that I talked about, because of that, that brings the effective tax rate up to 29.5%. So core business, tax rate 27%, 29.5% for 2011 because of the Quest disposal.</p>
          <p>This chart shows you the impact of restructuring charges. We've had these charges for a number of years. 2011 we'll have them again but I expect that will be the last year that you will see significant restructuring charges in GSK. And if you look from the summary, on track to the total program cost of &#xA3;4.5 billion, three quarters of the way through, &#xA3;1.1 billion to go and exactly in line in terms of the overall cost savings. Cash flow, cash flow clearly impacted that total operating profit impacted by &#xA3;4 billion of legal charges, but of course, you say &#xA3;4 billion of legal provisioning doesn't have any cash effect at all, does it?  So, where do you adjust for that?</p>
          <p>So, if you go about four lines down, increase and decrease and other net liabilities, the &#xA3;1.480 billion, we bring back the provisioning of &#xA3;4 billion into that line. So, that would give you a &#xA3;4 billion positive. But we have paid out &#xA3;2 billion of legal settlements so that has to be deducted from that &#xA3;4 billion to give you &#xA3;2 billion.</p>
          <p>We've paid another &#xA3;0.5 billion, just under &#xA3;0.5 billion to our pension funds in respect to deficit repair contributions. So, hopefully, I've made what is usually a very complicated line as simple as I can. That's the &#xA3;1.480 billion. Working capital, &#xA3;1.3 billion of cash generation. You may recall last year, I told you we report &#xA3;100 million adverse, I told you, but that's not really fair because we have got &#xA3;600 million of receivables in respect of flu pandemic sitting there because, simply as a result of the phasing of flu pandemic sales.</p>
          <p>Well, if it was unfair last year, it's also unfair this year in a sense the other way around. To get a better view of our economic progress, you should move about &#xA3;600 million of those receivables into 2009 so that should really show &#xA3;500 million of progress. You should take that &#xA3;600 off this year to show &#xA3;700 million of progress. Bottom line, over those two years, whichever way you do it, about &#xA3;1.2 billion generated for the business.</p>
          <p>Now, if you want to know what would have happened if we had done nothing, the general trend of the business moving sales into emerging markets, taking away from the U.S. would have probably increased working capital by &#xA3;250 million. So, if we had done nothing, we would be showing you &#xA3;250 million going out every year, we've done a lot of things out there to bring that overall working capital down.</p>
          <p>CapEx, &#xA3;1 billion, &#xA3;1.1 billion. Again, lower than the previous year. Again, helping the cash line. Bottom line, excluding legal settlements, &#xA3;1 billion extra free cash flow. Clearly paying &#xA3;2 billion out this year compared to &#xA3;250 million last year. That's the reason for the free cash flow decline as you see there.</p>
          <p>This chart shows you the working capital summary. The encouraging thing on this chart, even if you strip out that &#xA3;600 million in receivables from the total of &#xA3;905 million is each part of the working capital number is improving. We've talked many times to you about a lot of work being done on inventory, a lot of work, but every time I have presented that to you and told you that, I have never shown you an inventory saving. Hopefully, you had faith because even I may have lacked it on occasions, but inventory is driving savings. The work that has gone on in our manufacturing is going to continue and we're now starting to see the benefits of what I think probably even I failed to recognize takes quite a long time to deliver, but once that starts to work, it starts to continue to deliver.</p>
          <p>So what that chart shows you is action in each of the key areas and I would be fooling you if I was to suggest anything other and that's thousands of individual actions throughout the company. People are bonussed on working capital. They think about working capital. They talk about working capital. It's the only way to stop it going up. It's the only way to get it down.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, &#xA3;4.5 billion as you can see from it there. We paid an increasing dividend. We did acquisitions of &#xA3;633 million, including equity interests. We basically finished up by reducing debt by &#xA3;600 million pounds, so net debt ended the year, and if you were to look at the &#xA3;8.8 billion of net debt, what you would see is about &#xA3;6 billion of cash, and you'd see the rest being gross debt. And as we settle the legal matters in 2011, you will see that &#xA3;6 billion of cash come down. Its impact on the interest line won't be very great because it's not earning very much interest, but you will see that cash come down.</p>
          <p>I have talked to you about returning cash to the shareholders in the past, I have talked to you about the importance of increasing dividend, but they say actions speak louder than words, so for the last five years, that's what we've done. That's the dividends we've paid, all the final dividend that we have announced. 8% compound growth over that period. With that, I will hand it back to Andrew.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks, Julian. So, that really brings to an end the presentation. Just to remind you really of the summary of the business, and particularly in terms of how we're viewing the business going forward, in terms of underlying sales growth, continuing to drive operating and financial leverage, allowing us to make a priority of growing the dividend, and then support a new long-term share buyback program as a way to deliver returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I think what we'll do is go to Q&amp;A now. Maybe, Julian, if you want to come and join me up here. I'm very happy to open up the floor to questions. I may elect to bounce questions to other members, other Executive Directors who I introduced at the beginning. So if I see any of them looking vaguely distracted, they will be the person to get the question, I suppose. But let me open up the first question. Yeah, Michael. Just wait for a mic.

          <p>Thank you, Andrew. I was just wondering in terms of your R&amp;D, you said it had hence come down to 11,300. Within research, I wondered how many people you've actually got working for GSK, either internally or externally, who are actually focusing on generating innovation that you can then use in the future?  So, not just the R&amp;D head count but what sort of the ER, the innovation head count done over the last few years?</p>

          <p>Great question. Well, so, I will ask Patrick because he's obviously built, run and obviously continues to have oversight of that, in a second. Just very quickly, one of the key things we've done structurally and strategically is to try and strike a balance between in-house and out-of-house. I know there's a kind of ideological debate going on that drug companies either should be massive &#x2013; do all of it themselves or none of it themselves.</p>
          <p>I think we're very much in that middle space where we think there's tremendous economic and creative leverage to be gained from working with the networks of biotechs, academic, spinouts, all of that. And if you look at who our partners are on the outside, it's very diverse. Very diverse in how they're structured, where they come from, what turns them on. It's a very interesting set of different partners, but we truly believe it's important to have real excellence in your own discovery operations, both in terms of applied discovery, so in focused drug Discovery Performance Units, but also in platforms.</p>
          <p>So there are, we do believe there are certain dimensions of research where there is real opportunity, if you're right, to capture whole swaths of potential novelty in the future. So we do that inside. What that means, obviously you have a nice balance in terms of mix, control. You keep balance of what your future exposures are going to be. Because remember, today you pay for your internal R&amp;D on the P&amp;L; you pay for your external R&amp;D through milestones and royalties which will appear in the gross margin ten years from today. I think it's really important to keep those things in balance, right? Now, having said all of that, let me ask Patrick to give you a more specific question to the people.</p>

          <p>We've gone to 37 Discovery Performance Units, and they are the research innovation engines of GSK, with a number externally as well as Andrew said, and linked with academia. Those 37 Discovery Performance Units represent a decrease in head count in the research-specific part of GSK over the last few years of several hundred individuals. We're now &#x2013; so it's a relatively small group; 37 groups, ranging from the smallest being about 10 people, the largest being about 70 people, following this philosophy of integrated groups in a much more biotech-like environment, pulling on the big platforms of GSK to allow them to innovate and to develop it into products, and being focused and having chosen specific areas to work in.</p>
          <p>So we haven't reduced that. At the same time, we've gone, as Andrew said, to about 50% internal, 50% external in the way that's run, and of course those engines build on the platform support as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Frazer Hall from Berenberg. Andrew, a couple of questions. Just firstly, in the context of margins, you've obviously indicated some of the issues leading to margin pressure in the short term in 2011. But your remarks seem to imply not only a return to growth in margins in 2012, but clearly beyond that, i.e., that margin growth is something that you're looking for over the medium to longer term. So, I just wondered firstly whether you could talk about some of the moving parts around that.</p>
          <p>Second question, just in the context of the share buyback that you've announced today, this is at a point in time where you have got massive legal charges to pay, significant cash outflows. Going forward from here, those are, we hope, unlikely to be repeated. At the same time, you've talked about this possibly being the last year where we'll see major charges associated with restructuring, consumer disposals are to come. Can you just talk a little bit about going forward, how you look at free cash flow in the context of returning part of that in the form of a share buyback and what the outlook might be, again, sort of longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Again, I'll ask Julian to comment on that in just a second. I think overall, in terms of margin pressure and where we're going, I just think it's &#x2013; we spent so long putting together the right strategy for this company and the big structural changes that I've described here and we've talked about previously, but I think you can see crystallizing both in terms of substance and then in delivery of different parts of the business.</p>
          <p>It would make absolutely no sense at all for us to react to, albeit the big change in portfolio that these businesses represent, but it would be totally the wrong thing to then react to that by cutting from areas we know deliver value for the business, which is why I think it's appropriate, it's not great, but it's appropriate that we have this temporary blip in the margin. The other thing by the way which contributes to the blip is the charges in the U.S. and new tax, pharma tax in the U.S. which obviously comes in for the first time.</p>
          <p>Going forward, as that underlying sales growth starts to come back through reported sales growth, and as you continue to focus on cost control in the way we are doing, that's what gives us the confidence to say what we have said about the future on the margin.</p>
          <p>So, and I think I used the phrase in the letter very carefully, that structurally, we don't think there's any kind of issue with the margin. There's a temporary issue. We do think it will start to recover. Let me give you a couple of very specific examples. If you think back to &#x2013; let's go back a long way, 15 years, when the industry was growing. What did the industry do when it was growing?  It built massive R&amp;D facilities, big office buildings, all sorts of attributes of a fixed infrastructure. That is not going to happen again, right?</p>
          <p>So we've restructured the operation. We see ways where we can operate much more efficiently, and actually we think the opportunities for financial leverage in the P&amp;L, once the sales growth starts to kick in and be reported, much higher than it's been in the past because of all the changes we've made over the last few years. Moving from hundreds of decentralized finance organizations to a single finance operation is a good example, right?  It can give you real control.</p>
          <p>In the last two years, we've taken &#xA3;330 million of costs out of our support structures, finance, HR, real estate, security, services. That's on its way to a full end of 2012 target where we said we would take 20% of our total support costs out of the company. We're already far down the road on that. But doing that isn't just by squeezing. It's by completely changing the way we provide support in the organization, much more efficiently, much leaner.</p>
          <p>We have a goal even after that reduction, that the support operation of GSK has to eat inflation every single year as a minimum standard for year-in, year-out efficiency. So you can imagine, as that &#x2013; if you start to model what that looks like against an expectation of underlying and then reported sales, that's what gives you some confidence that over the years, '12, '13, '14, '15, you would anticipate improving the margin.</p>
          <p>Now, in the cash flow, let me ask Julian to talk about how we viewed cash flow. Obviously we have been very thoughtful about where we came out of 2010, the kind of liabilities we are going to need to deal with in 2012 before we made the decisions we made. But let Julian talk you through in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, clearly, we have this &#xA3;6 billion of cash which we will use as we come to settle what are &#xA3;4 billion of liabilities at the closing balance sheet. But I think more to your question, as restructuring falls away, as we get more cash generative, I think our focus is very clear. Number one, an increasing dividend. We've done it in the past, we're going to do it in the future.</p>
          <p>I think, number two, repurchasing shares or giving back cash to shareholders in whatever form is the most efficient, or if the return is higher and I emphasize it's almost like underlining if the return is higher, we will make selective acquisitions. But we're not in the business of making other people's shareholders rich. We're in the business of making our own shareholders rich, that's our strategy. So, I think that balance between the two is, I think, a pretty fair way for you to look at it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gbola Amusa at UBS, thanks for taking my question. A couple questions. First on legal, you made the comment that you plan to close out controversies efficiently and effectively, and we see another Avandia case in Utah. Would you comment on the timing of closing that one out, and whether it could be another tip of a big legal iceberg?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on R&amp;D, just given Pfizer's comments this week, clearly they are a different organization, but there are similarities in your DNA, For example, ability to invest in vaccines R&amp;D. Assuming that their decision might be right for them, what about Glaxo is different that makes keeping a 14% margin the right thing to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Good questions. As far as legal is concerned, I think what I would say is that the U.S. litigation and legal environment often leads to lots of subsequent cases. If you look at many of the areas of litigation we've dealt with over the last several years, it's not simply one case with one plaintiff. You often have peripheral cases. So in the commercials field, for example, you can have cases which involve all sorts of classes of consumers, wholesalers, retailers, payors. You get proliferation around the core, whatever the core issue was and clearly the same is potentially true in areas like federal investigations where you start to see states begin to get involved.</p>
          <p>You know, obviously, as I said at the beginning, it's impossible for to us give you certainty on unknown unknowns and how things are going to evolve. But the general pattern of expectation is that these sorts of things typically do not lead to very substantial further issues. Now, we have to resolve the primary issues and get all of those settled, as we have signaled but generally speaking, that has been the track record. But clearly, as things are only just starting, we should be a little cautious to be too presumptive one way or the other.</p>
          <p>But I'd reiterate what I said at the beginning. What we're required to do, unlike some of our U.S. competitors, because of different rules and guidances, we're required to provide what we realistically believe is the most likely number to settle all of our litigation. So, the legal provision we have, it's not that we just look at the legal provision and say, well, let's just have a provision just for case A and case B. It's a legal provision which is built up every single case that the company has and that's what delivers the number, okay?</p>
          <p>And that's the view we took for these results. Now, if lots of facts change, hopefully they don't, if they do, of course, we have to review it, and I think we tried to make that very clear, that that is a risk. As of today, we think the provision we have is absolutely the appropriate one for all the facts we have at our disposal today, which of course are laid out in the letter you got today.</p>
          <p>Please, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I see, sorry. That's the second question on Pfizer. I should have responded, that's amaze &#x2013; you're not the first person to ask me about Pfizer in the UK since yesterday. It's a really good question, actually. I have always been very resistant. We don't have a target that we will spend 14% to sales. That's not how we do it. It happens to work out to be 14% to sales. What we actually do is a very bottom-up approach to what we think is worth investing in in all of our different R&amp;D operations.</p>
          <p>And you know, to give you some sense of that, actually, we end up at 14% of sales but we're spending much less today in pharma than we used to. We're spending much more in vaccines. We're spending much more in dermatology. We're spending much more on consumer. And so the mix, it just happens to come out at 14%. It's not actually a target that we go for. It may go up a bit. it may go down a bit. It's not the way we're managing it. I think what we have done at GSK and listen, we will either win because we've made great choices on molecules and they turn out to be winners, or we won't because we end up with setbacks just like others have had. But what we have done is we have bitten the bullet on fundamentally changing the structure of R&amp;D on several dimensions.</p>
          <p>So, we've already dealt with a lot of the big fixed infrastructure in the operation, which was driving a huge amount of the fixed cost. We've dealt with the reduction, as you have heard, in our discovery operations internally versus externally, which makes you much more flexible to be able to move resources around the operation. We have been much more focused in creating accountability. The whole point of the Discovery Performance Units, there's nothing clever about putting only 30 people in a lab. What's clever about it is you know who is in charge and actually you can choose whether he's a good scientist and whether he or she makes good decisions, and you can actually get much greater clarity rather than losing them inside these massive facilities, where who is making decisions, is anybody making a decision?</p>
          <p>So, that is really, I think, what we bit the bullet on. I think it's been driven through in a very disciplined way, and I think it has made us a much, much stronger operation. We're running &#x2013; the pharma business is doing more work than it's ever done. It's more productive than it's ever been. It's got a more developed pipeline than it's ever had. It's more novel than it's ever been. We'll see whether it ultimately makes it, all those molecules make it to the finish line. But in terms of the substance of what it's doing, it's dramatic and it's freed us up to invest in all sorts of other places. Just so happens to add up to 14%.</p>
          <p>Yeah, Jo. Oh, sorry. You got a mic, I will let you go first.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Andrew. Mark Beards from Goldman Sachs. A couple of questions. One on margins, but in terms of emerging markets where you are pricing for volume. How should we think about the pressure on margins in those markets? And then secondly, ongoing legal costs are obviously a &#x2013; have been a significant part of SG&amp;A. How should we think about that in 2011 and beyond, as we model that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as margins are concerned, as you'll have seen, actually our margins in emerging markets continue to be very robust, around that 36% rate. I think that continues to surprise a lot of people, that that is as robust as it is. I think what it reflects is that we've got tremendous built leverage going on in lots of those markets.</p>
          <p>So, India, which is our lowest priced marketplace, one of our best businesses because we have got such a massive platform, right? The efficiency in that business is absolutely phenomenal. So, we're able to compete and actually deliver great margins at very, very low prices, and I think now we actually have products that we're selling at 3 rupees. So, you can't get &#x2013; that means we're selling products in the slums. And I'm very proud of that, I'm very proud that we're able to be a company that can bring brands to people at every income level in a country like India.</p>
          <p>So, I'm actually pretty confident around our margin structure. We're seeing very good responsiveness to price flexibility, but we've been able to drive great efficiency in those businesses as well. So at this point in time, I think that is a pretty reasonable estimate for those businesses. The only thing I would watch out for in emerging markets a little bit, is of course there are one or two of them which are more &#x2013; look a bit more like a Southern European, like a Turkey, and those are the ones to watch out for, because you're more likely to be exposed to significant one-off price pressures, which of course, will have an effect.</p>
          <p>But putting that to one side, I actually think the margin is pretty indicative of where you want to be. I personally don't think you want to be too much higher than that in these high-growth markets, because it would tell me we're not investing enough for share and growth. But I think that's a pretty reasonable position. In terms of the legal guidance, Julian, why don't you pick that one up?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you my usual answer which is you can't predict legal charges, which I guess history will prove to be right. We continue to work hard to resolve the legal cases we have. We do everything we can to ensure that we don't have future legal cases. I think that's all I can leave you with. I can't predict them.</p>

          <p>Three quick ones. Can you tell us a little bit about the outlook for Advair?  It was flat in the U.S., down in the last bit of the year. Is this a reflection of the new label sort of biting, and do you have any visibility on generic Advair in Europe coming through?</p>
          <p>The second question was just for Julian. If you have &#xA3;300 million or so of ongoing royalties, why is your expectation &#xA3;600 million for other operating income?  What's the other &#xA3;300 million, and is it sustainable?  And the final one, which is probably the meat of it, is R&amp;D productivity. You say you've got 15 or so assets that will give you Phase III results by the end of 2012. Are these assets ones that were put into Phase III with the new sort of harsh realism in them, and therefore will be a good guide of success rates going forward, or realistically are there some legacy projects that had already been started? Because I think investors need to see something better than the typical 50% Phase III success rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think there's about five questions there, Jo, but I'm going to give it a go. I will ask Moncef in a second to answer the R&amp;D question, and obviously Julian on the OOI. As far as Advair is concerned, in the U.S., yes, I think there has been an effect from the labeling changes from FDA. Clearly, it's FDA's intention to see a reduction in the use of combination products in asthma. Continue to see good performance in COPD, but there's no question there has been an impact from the labeling. That's the first thing to say.</p>
          <p>The second thing to say, which I think is much more just one of those things, is clearly Q4 '09 respiratory market in the U.S. was very high, and Q10 '09 isn't. So, there is also just a pan &#x2013; if you look at all products, all products' growth rates are down. So, some of it is specific to Advair, and it is &#x2013; I think it is the label. Some of it is much more general.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say though, which is easy to miss, is actually our script market share for the category of Advair plus Flovent went up, July to December. So yes, we're losing some growth and some share, not much, but some share from Advair. Actually, we're picking up that share very rapidly on Flovent, which as you know is the market-leading monotherapy steroid.</p>
          <p>So, yes, Advair is not quite where we would like it to be. Now going forward, I think the biggest issue is really where is the respiratory market going to go?  So, what kind of impact are we going to see in the respiratory market?  In terms of generics, we see no sign of anything at all in America. And I think 2010 was a very positive year for GSK in terms of clearing some of those clouds out of the way, and flushing out the truth of what was really going on. So, I think the U.S. side is good.</p>
          <p>We don't see any aerosols in Europe, which is important for the UK business because it's a very big aerosol business. There are, we think, putative filings for DPIs [Dry Powder Inhalers] but we don't know where they are in their process, and whether they get approved or not, we have to wait and see. But I'd say, if you went back a year, there's a heck of a lot less out there now than there was a year ago being talked about, and in the U.S. it's very hard to see anything.</p>
          <p>Graham. No, sorry. I can't do that, it's Julian and then Moncef.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jo. &#xA3;300 million, just under &#xA3;300 million from royalties. &#xA3;190 million from the Zovarix ointment which we just announced. You're pretty much at &#xA3;600 million. You're only &#xA3;110 million short. We'll do what we always do. We will look for noncore assets where we believe there's greater value in divestment than in retention. If there's greater value in retention, we'll keep them. If divestment gives the greater value, we'll sell them. So, that's our estimate today and obviously, Simon will update you to the extent that changes, but that obviously excludes consumer healthcare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, I think more or less that number probably is sustainable. You know, if you look plus or minus over the last few years and I suspect over the next few, that royalty income is a very high-quality flow of income and I think it's pretty unusual for us not to have a collection of assets, one way or another, which it's time to get rid of. So I would be a bit surprised if it went substantially below that, maybe a little bit here and there, but Moncef?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Jo, very good question. And so, what we started to do with R&amp;D strategy was to sharpen discovery, as Patrick explained, decrease our infrastructure costs and fixed costs to give us more flexibility, and critically, allocate capital for late-stage development to the highest possible standards. And in fact, what I say is we shouldn't fail for reasons we could have predicted after the fact.</p>
          <p>So in 2006, we actually cleaned the pipeline quite dramatically, for those of you who remember. Every single asset in the pipeline today. By the end of 2006, we had eight. We have 30 programs in Phase III, they have all been selected according to these criteria. Can I be sure that they will succeed?  No. They should not fail for reasons we should have predicted. Things may happen. We could have a liver signal. We could have other totally unpredicted observations, but that's the fact today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the big difference that Moncef and the team have really gone to is, we've gone from a business which up until that point was working on the basis of if it's possible then we'll do it, to a business which is if it's probable then we'll do it. And that's really the shift and it's really getting judgments to that burden of is it really probable that, you know, we believe that we made that move. Now, there is a counter balance to that, Jo, which is everybody wants differentiation. As everybody knows that if you want to have a high margin, sustainable pharmaceutical business in the future, you need to be differentiated. Otherwise, you're not going to get reimbursement and you're not going to get listed.</p>
          <p>Almost by definition, differentiation starts to ratchet up the risk again on the other side because you are, of course, going into more novelty or maybe less precedented areas. And that &#x2013; you just got to bear that in mind. So what Moncef's organization has tried to do is really raise the burden, the hurdle for making those choices; you just need to be realistic, that you want to have a highly differentiated product, you're probably doing at least something nobody has ever done before but that's exactly what the market is telling us they want because they're saying, if you're just giving me what somebody gave me five years ago, we're either not going to approve it because the FDA will take the view which says, why take any incremental risk for something which brings no new benefit or you'll get no price. And so that &#x2013; you just got to be realistic about that counterbalance in the system. Graham?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Graham Parry from B of A, Merrill Lynch. A couple on Avandia and one on consumer divestments. On Avandia, I'm just wondering if you can give us a feel for how many new Avandia cases you've actually received versus what you are predicting when you took your provision for fourth quarter; so, the proportion of that, which is actually in-house and within that, if you can include warehouse cases as well?</p>
          <p>Second, just going back to this argument that the statute of limitations potentially having passed on these cases. Remember, there was quite a lot of discussion about that last year with the discovery event, possibly the Nisin paper in 2007, is the fact that we're actually seeing cases make it through to court having to settle now indicative of the fact that that no longer applies, or is that something that would just be rolled up in a judge's final ruling anyway?</p>
          <p>And then the third question on consumer divestment, I just wanted to clarify when you say about retaining capital to shareholders as quickly as you can from those divestments, are you referring to funding the share buyback, or are you even thinking about a special dividend here?  Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the latter, just very quickly, that would be either further share buybacks so not the current. So the share buyback we announced today is independent of the disposal of the consumer products. When we transact the disposal of the consumer products, we'll return that to shareholders either through further share buyback or another vehicle like a special dividend, depending on what we think is in the best interest of the majority of the shareholders, and I know this creates tremendous controversy, but obviously, we have a lot of shareholders who end up paying tax on dividend, both in the U.S. and small shareholders.</p>
          <p>Other shareholders are very interested in special dividends. So, we'll obviously take some time just to try and figure out how to make the least number of &#x2013; or lose the least number of friends whatever decision we take. But I'm resigned to the fact that I won't keep all my friends. As far as Avandia is concerned, we're not going to talk about the numbers of cases for a completely obvious reason that that's part of the negotiations that are going on.</p>
          <p>But it's fair to say, I think, that when we look at all the cases that we're aware of, whether they're in-house or whether they're putatively out there in the ether, we believe we've settled the majority of those or more than half of those so far. So, I think we're making very good progress on that. I just think we need to be &#x2013; you know this is a dynamic or it has proven in the past to be a dynamic situation. Just need to try and get things resolved as quickly as possible. We've had some &#x2013; made some very good progress in the last couple of weeks. I feel good about that.</p>
          <p>The statute of limitations issue is very complex and varies all over the U.S. according to state. It's not a kind of simple yes-no actually and that's the reason why you're kind of not seeing it have a big impact in the way you might have anticipated. There are, however, other aspects of the U.S. system which is beginning to reduce in some areas a number of cases.</p>
          <p>So, you know, it's a rapidly moving environment or it has been. We're keen to get it closed off as soon as possible is exactly what we're doing and we think we've made a sufficient provision for what we can see and what you could reasonably expect based on the trends we have seen over the last six or nine months. If that trend suddenly changed, you know, obviously, can't guarantee that, but within the context of the trend we've seen, we think we've got the right number. Yeah. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas. A few questions, first on the respiratory. Can you give us an idea of when you anticipate to submit Advair in the U.S.?  What is your view on the fact that you could launch a big safety trial as Novartis announced a few days ago?</p>
          <p>Now, in Europe, still in respiratory, on the generic side, can you maybe give us some flavor on which are the most risky countries for generics competition for Advair in Europe?  And last question on margins, as we understand that the emerging markets margin should remain flattish or improve slightly, as you anticipate going forward for the group as a whole an improvement of the margins where we should see the improvement in Europe, in the U.S., where you already have some pressure there. Can you give us some flavor?  Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as far as Relovair is concerned, I will let Darrel in a second to comment about this issue of whether or not big safety studies are going to be needed or not?  Darrel has been involved in the development of Relovair right from day one when we were &#x2013; how many beta2's did we have in the pool and how many steroids?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eight B2 agonists and four steroids.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's quite important. This guy has managed twelve molecules to the two which are in Relovair. There's been a &#x2013; I know a lot of people thought we were taking a long time over this, but we've been doing it properly. I will ask him to comment in a second on that. In terms of the projected filing, we're looking for a 2012 filing for the product. I'm sure you want to know which day. I'm not going to tell you.</p>
          <p>So, generic Seretide in Europe, there is already a generic on the market in Greece. It's not doing very well, but there is one out there. I wouldn't say there's any particularly higher risk place than any other, and you know, we just have to wait and see if anybody has a product which is actually registerable in Europe by anybody. They're all, by definition, using new devices, so, you know, they have to prove that their device works and they have to prove it's similar to ours.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we're not aware of any aerosol products. So, that means in areas where we have very big aerosol businesses, that's obviously going to be a little less vulnerable and that means the UK in particular. Darrel, why don't you address the safety question or safety study question, and then I'll ask Julian to comment on margin progression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the safety study question which has come up recently is in the context of COPD and we've consulted as we've moved Relovair and COPD through to the point that it's reached, it's now in Phase III. And also, over the LAMA/LABA, the beginning of Phase III which was announced today. So, we've had ongoing consultations with the FDA on that. The programs we've designed are completely aligned to their advice and we just don't have the same inference from those discussions as the inference which Novartis drew about the need for large safety studies prior to approval in COPD.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Julian, do you want to make a comment on margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On margins, our strategy is clearly through a combination of pipeline success, emerging markets, consumer healthcare to drive sales growth as fast as we can. We believe that will lead to that improvement that Andrew talked about. We don't want to be any more specific in terms of segments at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question, yeah, please. And then we'll go there and then Kevin and then, I think, Alexandra, did you have your hand up in the back?  Yeah, good. Three. How are we doing on time?  Are we okay?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Marc Purcell from Barclays Capital. Just on the LAMA719, I just wondered if you could help us understand how you think it's going to be positioned, in terms of its clinical profile and prices versus Spiriva and NVA237?</p>
          <p>Second question, how much of a disadvantage, if there is at all, is there not having an in-house companion diagnostics business in developing your targeted oncology agents?  And then lastly, the CHMP guidelines do not explicitly demand a sort of 300, 500 patient clinical study for respiratory generics, but in light of the setbacks we've seen in Europe over the last 12 months, do you believe that it's going to be very tough to get approval of a respiratory generic without such a trial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, generics in Europe, generics everywhere for respiratory is tough. To be honest, as I have said repeatedly, that's their problem to figure out. You know, we'll see whether anybody is able to sort this out. I think what we've seen over the last three years is that most people who say they're going to do it and it's easy, fail, and we'll have to see whether anybody's able to thread the needle and U.S. is clearly very, very difficult. Europe isn't easy. I'll put it that way.</p>
          <p>As far as diagnostics are concerned, in the MAGE 3 program and related programs in our vaccine organization, we're very active in that field. Obviously, we don't own. We have no intention of buying a diagnostics company, but we do own some very substantial IP around a suite of diagnostic tests which would be associated with this. We have put in place various partner solutions so that those diagnostics are generated in a timely manner for availability with the vaccine if it's successful.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we're going to get data on that over the next couple of years. I think we're in very good shape to make sure that, A, there will be a diagnostic and it will be very important. There will be at least two layers of critical diagnostics to get to the perfect patient for the vaccine. I think we're in good shape for that. We're in good shape to capture the economic benefit of that. And the last thing I want to do is spend billions of dollars buying a diagnostic business I know absolutely nothing about and may or may not have the technology &#x2013; I always think in diagnostics, you have a very high chance of buying Betamax, you know what I mean?  Kind of looks sexy and great, turns out everyone wants the VHS. I'm not so sure. So that's that one. And 719, Darrel, you're probably the best person to talk about 719, although we've only announced today the start of Phase III of combination of the product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the Phase III program that will go forward is based upon the data that we generated in Phase IIB with 719 alone. We also have Vilanterol, that's the same beta agonist that's in the Relovair development and the Phase III program will look at those in combination. We will also look at the individual agents and we will include in those Phase III pivotal studies comparisons with Tiotropium.</p>
          <p>A lot of patients in COPD who require a bronchodilator who perhaps don't need an inhaled steroid are appropriate for these bronchodilator agents. They all respond variably depending upon the extent of the beta response if they have any and the extent of cholinergic too. So, we think in the population overall, in the combination, we will &#x2013; we expect to see patients who benefit better from the combination from Spiriva and that's a very obvious route for us to go in terms of further development. The question as to whether the LAMA alone &#x2013; 719 alone has a role, I think will be established when we see from the data from those Phase III studies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Kevin Wilson from Citi. Andrew, in the context of the drug industry generating a lot of cash and you've illustrated how you've improved your cash generation today and governments being very short of cash and trying to access the cash that you have, what comfort can you give shareholders that the environment is not actually going to get worse from where we are today and also, I'm interested in your perspective that in the three years or so you have been charge, has it got worse?  How should you lead us to think about how it's going to be going forward?</p>
          <p>And where are you in that continuum of the company's giving cash back to governments in a variety of ways. But I'm trying to sense of whether the industry is about to get clobbered, if you like and you have dealt with quite a lot your issues?  Should we worry in the broader sense is there more of this to come, or is it just part of doing business in the drug industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's one of those questions where almost whatever I say, you're going to be back in a year saying you said. It's a very difficult question. So if you think about the overall stance of governments, there's no doubt, I'm absolutely sure that in the last three, four years we have seen lots of governments say, aha, let's cut some prices rather than make it tough. You know, downsizing decision of a government department or can we ratchet up our investigative services to try and yield greater fines and if you look at the ratio of all fines paid in the U.S., how much comes from the drug industry?  It's pretty striking what's happened in the last three or four years but no doubt about that.</p>
          <p>I think the closure, bluntly, I think the closure yesterday of Sandwich is a pretty clear signal to governments. It has nothing to do with the science base of the UK. I think it has everything to do with the pressure that's being put on the industry mostly by government. And I think that gradually governments will start to realize that constantly cutting prices, limiting access, reducing patents and raising fines has somewhere down the line, there is a breaking point, right?  Where things start happening which you don't like as a government, and I think, you know, actually Pfizer's decision yesterday seems to me a completely rational decision in the context of all the pressures that companies like Pfizer and we are under.</p>
          <p>So, I do think that actually governments are particularly in the current macroeconomic environment, really I think governments are more and more thoughtful about this and I think they are beginning to see a little bit of whoa, maybe we need to be just a little more thoughtful</p>
          <p>We have seen that in Europe where initial, very draconian price increases quite often get rode back or redirected to old, rather than innovative products or retitrated slightly. I think we may start to see some improvement there. You know, I don't know about things like litigation where everybody else sits because other people have different provisioning standards to ours. Our obligation is to tell you in advance what we think is the most likely number we're going to have to pay.</p>
          <p>So, before we've got to a settlement, we make a provision. That's what we do every quarter. As you know, particularly companies in the U.S. are obliged to make a provision within a range of possible outcomes and the range of outcomes could include zero which is why quite often in the states, you will find a company announce settlement and the number on the same day without having previously had it in a provision. So, it's almost impossible for me to tell you where everybody else sits.</p>
          <p>Having said that, you look at even our &#x2013; the things we've been talking about when you compare that to other companies in recent past, there's plenty bigger numbers out there than the numbers that we have been dealing with. So, hard to say where it's going to go going forward. The governments need to be very careful not to overdo it because I think this is an industry which has very long cycle times, incredibly difficult to rebuild the capability that's quite easy to shut down actually, and there is a danger that governments or different elements of government have a kind of free rider assumption that everything they do has no impact but the cumulative effect of hundreds of free riders is very significant and I think there is a risk of that. Where we are in all of that?  I think we are as a general point, I think we are at the better end of the spectrum. Why?</p>
          <p>Because we've certainly borne the brunt of a lot of the loss of exclusivity impact. We've gone from being a business which was dominated by exactly those sorts of products where you could no longer depend on the patent being upheld in a courtroom and you had surprise invalidations of patents. We have gone from that to a business which is predominantly by far not exposed to that risk by design of geography and by design of where we focused our R&amp;D investment. So that, I think, is a big shift and so, I think going forward, our potential exposures there are diminished rapidly.</p>
          <p>I think to the extent to which governments have more pressure on you on pricing, you want to be more differentiated and not less and I have just described while there's a risk in that from an R&amp;D perspective because you're unprecedented, it's clear that we're committed to being a more differentiated business and therefore, we should have more pricing influence than we would otherwise and I think that's moving us into a much more positive place. We focus very hard on how we interact with payers so Eddie has finally figured out how to get deals done with NICE and you have seen the Votrient deal done with NICE and in the U.S., Deirdre has put in place price protection contracts with payers which have had a significant impact on our ability to get access in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So we've worked on that front. I think we're starting to make very good progress. The litigation piece?  I mean, I've said everything I can say about it which is we're doing everything we can to clean up a lot of historic litigation. Nobody's happy about it, but we're getting it done. We've got a lot done. We've got a couple of big pieces still to get done and then if you look at how we're operating our business, we are absolutely focused on making sure we're operating a business which is in step with current expectations, and that's why we're the only company to have &#x2013; and we're the only drug company, still, not to give political donations to politicians in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We're the only drug company to not reward our reps based on generation of prescriptions, and I mean, you go on and on and on, all of these different areas where we have over the last three years, absolutely had a commitment to get ourselves in a very different place. That, I believe, puts us in a relatively better position. Does it make us immune?  Does it mean there isn't something else I don't know about from the past which is going to pop up?  No, I can't promise you that. Does it mean we're in control of building a stronger company, which can withstand that risk?  Absolutely. Alexandra.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. I'm looking for some color on the Relovair COPD outcome study which you have announced today, things like size, comparators, time lines but also how it's different from TORCH?  And the second question I just have is since you are saying there will be fewer bolt-on acquisitions, do you still think even with fewer bolt-ons, you can live up to your forecast that you made in the third quarter that you're going to grow your emerging market line at least in line with the 14% forecast of IMS for that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think on the latter one, I do feel very good about our emerging market business in terms of its organic potential to grow, and I actually think because although we've got, you know, UCB is a terrific acquisition, Phoenix in Argentina is a terrific acquisition. The BMS business in Pakistan and Egypt, terrific acquisitions. The real core of what's going on in that business is we're pricing our products right in all the different categories and what we're seeing is much greater volume movement on our classic brands, the Ventolins, the Augmentins, all of that as well as our innovative brands and some of the biggest responses we've had have been on products like Avamys, products like Tykerb, where we're just getting those positioning right in the marketplace. So, of course, we've had some help from acquisitions but I actually think while that's been going on, we have really got our organic, competitive model in great shape there as well.</p>
          <p>So, I'm pretty confident we're going to be able to continue to grow at or better than the marketplace in that part of the world. I'm going to ask Darrel to talk to this and again, you know in addition to having dealt with all the pool of molecules, he also was involved in the design of TORCH as well as the new trial. So, I think probably the right person to answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll stand up so I can answer this way. So, the Relovair mortality study, which, again, is starting this week is a large study. We'll have 16,000 patients and we'll look at Relovair and its components compared to usual care in COPD and the primary outcome that we'll be looking at is survival. The difference from TORCH is important because this is a moderate population of COPD patients whereas TORCH was really sort of more moderate to severe and these patients have been chosen because they're at cardiovascular risk. They either have existing cardiovascular disease, they have had cardiovascular events or there are other indicators that they're at risk of cardiovascular events and there's a lot of science in the literature to suggest that there's a very clear link between COPD and cardiovascular risk, smoking is obviously the common link to that and the effect of smoking in many cases is through the lungs.</p>
          <p>So if you can improve the COPD control, the hypothesis is you can actually affect cardiovascular risk, and we've looked very carefully at the historical data that we have both from the TORCH study and another very large study which we did which was called INSPIRE to also to generate a hypothesis. A way to test the hypothesis is to do this large comp study and that's the study that we have started today. Well, 16,000 patients, we have to select those patients.</p>
          <p>We'll need to go to a very large number and it will be over a thousand centers around the world. The design of the study is such that the duration will be driven by the number of events that we see. So, it makes it very difficult frankly for us. We will be following up the vital status of all patients that get recruited into the study. Patients might be in the study for varying lengths of time and we also to have recruit that large number of patients, so it really &#x2013; it makes time lines difficult for us to predict.</p>
