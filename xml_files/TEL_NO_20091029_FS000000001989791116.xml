          <p>Yeah. Good morning ladies and gentleman and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Third Quarter Results for 2009. I am Scott Engebrigtsen and I have the pleasure of guiding you through this morning's presentation. We hope that everyone has got hold of the material that we've made available, that would include our press release, the quarterly presentation and the quarterly report and the copy of the presentation, which will be used here in a minute.</p>
          <p>As usual, you have the opportunity to watch this presentation live or in recording on either the internet or on a mobile phone and you may also send in your written questions during the transmission via the internet. You will find information on all these alternatives from our website at telenor.com. As usual we'll have Q&amp;A session after the presentations here. First from the audience present here at Fornebu, then from the ones participating on the phone. And finally you will have opportunity to do individual interviews here.</p>
          <p>To present the figures today, we have our CEO, Jon Fredrik Baksaas; and our CFO, Trond Westlie and I'll leave the floor to you, Mr. Baksaas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Scott and welcome to Telenor's third quarter 2009 reporting. Under the circumstances, we do believe that this third quarter is quite a solid quarter. We have executed on our priorities for this year and this new set of framework that we all work under. And this has resulted in quite solid margins and strong cash flow for the third quarter. The market development is more or less in line with previous quarters, there are some positive signs in the Nordic and in Asia, while Central and Eastern Europe in particular, seems to have a longer way ahead, before there is growth returning.</p>
          <p>The big event for this quarter is of course the agreement that we announced with our friends in Altimo previously this quarter, where we will be creating a new emerging market player, called VimpelCom Ltd. At this chart, we also show you the operating cash flows and I just want to highlight right away that if we compare the three quarters, the third quarter from 2008 up to 2009, we had NOK 6 billion of operating free cash flow since third quarter last year. This year it's 5.2, but that includes the step-up of the investments done in India with NOK 2 billion.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to our different regions, I'll start with the Nordic. Again there is a continued and strong demand for mobile broadband and in Norway in particular, where the effects of the world economic situation seems to be limited at consumer level. There is a 9% mobile revenue growth in this quarter. This figure has three elements and in rough terms one-third comes from increased traffic, one-third comes from increased hardware sales, primarily related to the iPhone, which is a strong driver for this growth happening and one-third coming from the wholesale build up with the Network Norway.</p>
          <p>In Sweden, we also see signs of improvements coming out of our efforts to streamline that operation much better. We have downsized during this quarter with quite a number of full time employees, unfortunately as well as reduced consultancy activities. And we have also established quite a systematic and new base for building our customer base and we see optimistic results of this in this quarter.</p>
          <p>I also want to mention that in our broadcast activities, we have a 6% organic growth figure this quarter, which is also quite strong in this region and the EBITDA level is 24% and for those of you that are into the details here THOR 6, our new satellite is expected to be launched later today in fact.</p>
          <p>We have now reached in the Nordic as a whole, 550,000 unique broadband &#x2013; mobile broadband users and this feature &#x2013; this seems to be up-helding its popularity building further.</p>
          <p>If we then move to Central and Eastern Europe, this seems to the most, should I say sluggish market development in this quarter compared to the Nordic and as we will show you, also for Asia.</p>
          <p>The macroeconomic situation is tough in these countries. In Ukraine, Kyivstar has managed to stabilize its subscription base as the details on that campaign were introduced in July. The organic revenues though compared to third quarter last year was down 11%, but here we also must bear in mind that third quarter and fourth quarter in 2008 was particularly a good growth quarter in Ukraine, whereas the third quarter this year, 2009, is more in line with the significant step-down in volumes that we saw coming into this marketplace crossing over into this year, beginning in January.</p>
          <p>And of course, the Norwegian kroner figure is heavily affected by the depreciation of the national currency. Having seen this slow development in revenues it's impressive how Kyivstar managed to upheld margins and trim its cost base and it's done a phenomenal job in Kyivstar to achieve this.</p>
          <p>In Hungary, we also see a further weakening of the economy. There was an introduction of an additional 5% sales tax on all consumer goods in Hungary this quarter and that's of course a pretty significant cut in disposal income at consumer level. And so, this year &#x2013; this quarter we see an 8% reduction in revenues, but and again despite this also Pannon has managed to maintain its margin and its market share. And under the circumstances we can be quite satisfied on how both these two companies has met this recessionary elements.</p>
          <p>In Serbia, we managed to keep the ARPU figure quite flat year-over-year, but here again the authorities introduced a sales tax and in Serbia, only applicable for mobile services. And of course, such moves from the framework setting of the economy act negatively at least in the short-term. However, also in Serbia, we've managed to keep the relative position up against competition and reasonably well also upheld in the margin level.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence, all &#x2013; the full region creates significant cash flows in &#x2013; under these circumstances whereas it seems that CapEx primarily is not following the same path as before due to the lower growth level.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Asia, there are &#x2013; as we &#x2013; if I can see here the positive trends both in Bangladesh and Pakistan and it's continued since previous quarter. We have quite significant customer growth in both operations, around 800,000 additional customers in both countries and actually this takes the overall customer base to 172 million in all our operations together.</p>
          <p>And this has been driven by the lowered SIM tax in Pakistan as well as a subsidy on the SIM tax in Bangladesh. And this has given a nice growth in revenues for Pakistan, as well as on the EBITDA level and as you can see again Pakistan reports positive cash flow, so we do believe here that we are under good way to deliver on positive cash flows for the operation for the year as a whole next year.</p>
          <p>Grameenphone is again an extraordinary example. There is a high EBITDA margin of high 50s in the quarter where customer uplift has been a significant feature and also the fact that the company will be stock listed. Yesterday 20,000 persons were present when we did the selection of the &#x2013; or election of the shareholder base for Grameenphone and as a result at 2 O'clock yesterday we could report as we had 317,000 new private shareholders in Grameenphone and they were all named physically at one list at the stadium where this was taking place and this chart was 324 square meters banking. So, we could really say that the stockholder register was carved in paper as it was ending up yesterday. It's expected that the Grameenphone will be listed from a date, second half in November.</p>
          <p>Then in Pakistan, in addition to seeing sort of very good results coming out of Pakistan, in the mobile sector Telenor, we also have to bear in mind the security situation in Pakistan and we are of course very concerned about this and we follow the situation closely. We have spent quite a significant amount on protectionary means, securing our employees and our installations. But the overall atmosphere is of course that of an extraordinary situation after the government initiatives and the army initiatives in Waziristan. This has given unfortunately a rise in violent attacks and it has increased the risks in the whole society and I also regrettably have to say that in the yesterday's attack in Peshawar which was one of those examples of violence attacking the people. We sadly we see that a person who was working in the distribution on behalf of one of our distributors was part of the death toll of more than 100 people and of course this is a extremely sad event to register and it is an example on the risk factor in that society. We hope of course that the Government of Pakistan manage to create the necessary effort to establish peace and security, but we must also be aware that the situation for the time being is quite extraordinary in Pakistan, having said that, on the economic side as you can see the local economy moves further and we're part of those wheels that hopefully in the longer run will create stability and prosperity for the Pakistani people.</p>
          <p>And I should also mention there are operations in Malaysia and Thailand where we are seeing some small, some slight pickup in activities, not that it is back to earlier times of growth in early 2008, but there are some signs and as you can see from the figures reported yesterday, both operations are doing reasonably well relative to market development and we are of course looking forward and hopeful that this can continue.</p>
          <p>There will be another big event towards the end of this year that will be the launch in India. The GSM contracts are now signed, and of course they are in operation. We are ready to launch some day in the fourth quarter. We will not be specific on the date on this presentation here for obvious reasons. But we have managed to establish the necessary distribution network. There is a second tower sharing agreement in place which increases flexibility and also improves the price structure of the needed tower structure in India and when we launch we will have a very high number of towers in place without having constructed one single towers ourselves and that is of course one of the reasons why these can be done at this scale in such a short time. There are an Indian roaming agreement in place and we are ready to launch Uninor in the Indian market later in the fourth quarter. The increased competition as we've seen just recently in India, of course also plays into how we want to develop our project in India. And we'll also build this into our business case going forward. There will be no more specific details on that on this presentation also, again, obvious reasons, because we want to do the launch before we comment deeper into the business case as such.</p>
          <p>Then closing in before handing over to Trond, there is a &#x2013; as we see it a solid platform for how we can move Telenor forward. We have built and responded to the new economic situation in our markets. We do believe we are positioned for new potential growth when this reappears in our different marketplaces and in that sense we will continue to monitor both market development and competitive moves or dynamics in the competitive marketplaces in the same way as we tried to do over the two last quarters. And then with the agreement with Altimo in place we are looking also very much forward to work on the details from the data presenting that here until launch will happen sometime second quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I hand over to Trond. Trond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Fredrik. I was thinking about using the weather as a sort of a proxy, because last year, presenting the third quarter, it was a snow-blizzard outside. And now it's &#x2013; the sun is shining very much. I do think that's a good intro to the third quarter, I do think that third quarter has and we are delivering very good numbers.</p>
          <p>Even though we see slight revenue declined year-over-year of 1%, I do think that &#x2013; the development of being in line with 2009 is very much the same. We're ending up in Norwegian kroner at NOK 26.5 billion in revenue, and going over to the EBITDA 10 billion 55 million (sic) [10.055 billion] . The 10.055 billion is influenced by the one-off recognition of a change in pension plan in EBITD of more than 500 million. So, taking out the 500 million, we're going to lower the percentage of margin of 38 down to approximately 36 points &#x2013; percent. But we do see that the trend is actually following the same elements as we have been doing the last couple of quarters. So, if you go to the sort of the development of revenues and EBITDA, you'll see that we have reported revenue of declined of 2.7% and 0.7% year-over-year for the third quarter. But if you look at the spread, it's actually quite interesting because it varies quite significantly.</p>
          <p>We see that reported numbers here in the Central and Eastern Europe, it actually has a negative effect of reported numbers up to 42% in reported figures, even though we're down to 13 in negative elements. So, the fundamental thing is that you see it's a mixed picture in the Nordic region, neutral to mix &#x2013; neutral to positive. In the Central and Eastern Europe, it's fundamentally EBIT negative and in Asia it's fundamentally EBIT positive. And that's basically the trend as we've also seen the sort of the economics in the different countries. But as you see, it's a big variance ending up sort of on the organic development.</p>
          <p>Going to the capital expenditures, ending up at NOK 4.8 billion spending this quarter that is with the &#x2013; with India of approximately 2.0 &#x2013; almost 2.1 billion spending in &#x2013; in India. So, not including India, we're at a CapEx to sales of approximately 10%. Going then to the bridge on the right side of the slide, we see that the CapEx spending Q3 '08 were 4 billion. We increased the spending in Asia that is including India. Excluding India from that number, we have a declined of 600 million for the remainder operation in Asia. So, 2 billion spending in &#x2013; in India makes a decline on the other operations in India &#x2013; in Asia for 600 million. And you see that we're reducing both in CE and Nordic as well as in broadcast, broadcast reduction is very much the sort of the reduction as a result of the roll out of the DTT platform is finished, ending at 4.8 billion in capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Going then to the cash flow in the quarter. We have a cash &#x2013; operating cash flow of NOK 5.3 billion. That is down from the 6 billion and as we have said on the rolling four quarters we peaked at the second quarter 2009, expectedly. We're going a bit down as a result.</p>
          <p>If you take that by regions, we see that we're trending upwards; an increase year-over-year with 1.3 billion in cash flow from the Nordic operations coming up to 9.4. And as we previously have stated, the &#x2013; we see the 10 billion target closing in. Central and Eastern Europe declined specifically in Norwegian kroners as a result of the currency effects from those &#x2013; from that region, but the major driver on this is of course the nominal numbers coming out of Kyivstar, even though the nominal numbers also in local currencies have declined, it doesn't decline that much as in Norwegian kroners.</p>
          <p>In Asia, you see we're declining from last &#x2013; from last quarter as a result of the two billion spent in &#x2013; 2.1 billion spent in India, but even though we still have an increase year-over-year in the positive cash flow coming out of Asia. Looking at the sum of not including Asia, that is approximately 5.5 billion coming out of Asia.</p>
          <p>Then going to the reported numbers, for the reported numbers we are reporting 24.3 billion in revenue, up from 23.4 last year. We have an earnings before depreciation and amortization of 8.8 billion. That includes the income of EDB of 570 million. Other items is basically EDB write-downs and some minor element &#x2013; some other minor elements, leaving us at a normalized &#x2013; or a reported EBITDA of 8.5 billion, impairment losses from EDB and then at an EBIT of earnings before interest and tax at 4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Associated companies coming out of VimpelCom and Kyivstar, VimpelCom at 1.4 billion and 400 million from Kyivstar. Net financials is basically very little currency or derivative effects this quarter, so we're at basically net finance cost of 674 and then profit before taxes of almost 5.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Profit from continuing operations of 4.1 billion and net income of 3.8 billion, that is after taking the remaining exposure on our project in Cinclus, so that we're ending up at 3.8, that makes us earnings per share of 232 <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Going to the positive development on the net debts, we see that we are also reducing our net debt this quarter from the 35.3 last quarter to the 28.6. Part of that is of course a currency effect with two billion, approximately NOK 2 billion, but in essence as you can see on the right side, it's very &#x2013; basically drives down from the earnings, the normal payments of interest taxes and CapEx and then some dividend to minorities, specifically from dividend and a small element from Grameenphone and then accruals and then we're ending up at the net debt of 28.6 and that is a ratio of EBITDA to debt on 0.9.</p>
          <p>Going then to the outlook for 2009, it's only three months left, so we're reiterating our organic revenue line on &#x2013; in line with 2008, although slightly on the negative side. We have adjusted our EBITDA number and increased it from 34 to around 35, part of that is of course the effect on the EDB recognition of change in pension plan, but it's also &#x2013; the remaining part is also a result of improved operations.</p>
          <p>The CapEx to sales has been adjusted to be around the 13% level from earlier, previously that we said 13 to 15, so now we're guiding on around 13.</p>
          <p>Going to the India guidance, the organic revenue is the same. We adjusted the EBITDA loss a bit down from earlier we said between 1.5 and two, now we're saying around 1.5. And the CapEx remains the same between 3.5 and &#x2013; 3.5 and 4.5 for the year. And in total that will leave us at the EBITDA level between 33 and 34% and have a CapEx to sales around the 17% level, and that also includes the satellite launch that we hopefully will accomplish tonight.</p>
          <p>And that leaves my part of the presentation and my last presentation for the quarterly reports of Telenor.</p>

          <p>Any questions? We have up here.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Arild Nys&#xE6;ther from Fondsfinans. I have three quick questions, if I can. One is on cost and CapEx efficiencies, you've surprised now with better than expected earnings for a number of quarters, primarily due to better cost efficiencies and we have seen. Do you think this is now at sort of at full effect or do you still see increasing effects from your efficiency programs?</p>
          <p>Number two is, the debt level now is 28.6 as you pointed out, at the beginning of this year it was 45, it's an enormous reduction. Could this have anything &#x2013; implications on how you think about receiving dividend payments?</p>
          <p>And the last point, you pointed out big, big differences in organic growth between units with the Ukraine and Hungary in being the negative drag and Pakistan and Bangladesh being the positive. Can you elaborate some on how you see this continuing in short to medium term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are three quite wide questions, I'll say. As to the efficiency measures, it will always be so that having done one set of actions in one quarter or the previous quarter or the second half year or this year as a whole, then our companies will of course also be looking to creating further efficiencies into the next periods to come. So, hopefully we have created an environment, where we also can see that kind of effects showing themselves so into the future.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, there is also a relative to competition kind of balance that we need to both check upon and nurture, because in the telco industry it is very easy to create sort of enormously good results in a short timeframe, losing out on the market share in the longer perspective. So, we keep also a pretty strong look forward to that balance.</p>
          <p>And as to the negatives versus the positives in this period, we've stated here pretty clearly that Asia is that region that brings forward the clear sign sort of as a region. That economic activity is building up again and that is according to how prognoses were led by analysts and sort of institutions that are doing that. But on the other hand, I also think we can say that the development hasn't gone &#x2013; hasn't moved as deep as the analysts said for the year as a whole, and that's also good for the local economic activity.</p>
          <p>And seeing now India, we're based in and also China being sort of the driver on the economic side, primarily domestic driven, then we see exactly what was the part of the big picture in politics say when we began 2009, whether it will continue. Well, hopefully and also this growth will continue and that it will also start to build in those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that today is lagging this development. But within Telenor we're cautious about saying when because we believe that that can take quite a while in fact. Trond?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, once again. On the &#x2013; what we acknowledge is that the cash flow so far has definitely been better than we expected. But in your analyses you also have to consider that 5 billion of that improvement is currency related. So that slightly picks up some of it at least in the sort of uncertainty. But in addition to that we also have to consider that it is big investment that's coming up in 2010. But having said that I do think that as a result of the position we're in the Board basically have to address that question coming up in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. It's Morris Patrick from Barclays Capital. Just wanted to start off first of all just by congratulating you on how you responded to criticism over the past six months by focusing on margins, cash flow and also removing the overhang of VimpelCom and Kyivstar and also Trond thank you for the last 17 quarters, I think it is of results at Telenor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But let's mention the last elephant in the room if you like which is &#x2013; which is India, clearly you've removed the overhang of Altimo, it appears you've done so. And now India remains, would you look at alternative structures for India? So if, for example, putting more assets into the joint venture perhaps India and as you see the economic probably the economic but rather the competitive environment in India deteriorating, how will and when would you look at your investments in that marketplace? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a bit early to start to address that question. At least give us a chance to launch our service first, so as we are at least visible at street level, which we have prepared so strongly for over the last 8 to 10 months. So, Stan Vellum and his team, they are preparing very, very energetically to get that launch to happen. We are aware that the competitive situation is very strong in India. We were aware of that when we started. We are also recognizing the fact that penetration has reached 30% plus, but on the other hand it's only 30% plus in a country which is the second strongest growth among any countries in the world economy for the time being. So it's in that environment we're competing. Go to sort of start to discuss and speculate on sort of structural things is way too early and something that we wouldn't do from sort of this podium at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just one quick follow-up in terms of the economic recovery you're seeing, I mean clearly the disparity between what you're seeing in some of the Asian markets and some of the Eastern European assets, what exactly are you seeing in terms of, is it the increased usage, is it the consumers willingness on prepay, what are the main changes you're experiencing in these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then again, I think you're back to sort of to go country-by-country and it probably becomes too lengthy to do that at this moment. But generally speaking a country like India will of course be a prepaid driver for at least the coming two to three years where penetration is expected to double. If we go to a country like Malaysia for sort of taking the other side of the statistics when it comes to penetration, there mobile Internet access is the driver and there we are in the midst of transition to 3G. So, then we are in a driver which we have seen being the driver here in Scandinavia for the year starting, say, 2003 onwards. But I think we've seen this kind of development in other markets before. If there is an economic growth happening I think that development that we saw in Scandinavia over the last five years will happen at the speedier &#x2013; at a higher speed but of course the economic development plays a big role in that.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. A couple of questions please. I might just follow-up on a comment on the net debt, I think you said that given the much lower net debt the Board would perhaps be addressing this issue in Q4, I mean if I could just sort of push a little more, I mean if it was decided that that was perhaps an inefficient structure, would there be a opportunity to announce the resumption of dividend earlier or could there be a one-off distribution et cetera. And then just a follow-up on India, I guess. When you originally built the investment plan and gave the guidance et cetera, did you foresee the current levels of price competition, is that in your model, and if it is, are you expecting the situation to deteriorate further before it improves? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, coming to the net debt dividend issue. No, I'll just say &#x2013; reiterate. We accept that we have an improved cash flow and improved net debt situation. We're also saying that it is going to be a big investment in 2010. And the only thing I've said was that the Board will have to address that when it comes to the end of the fourth quarter. I did not say anything about anything happened before that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess to just follow-up, what does that mean the Board will have to address this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, they're taking no decision, the point still being what we said earlier, but we have to acknowledge that we are in having a better cash flow position. But then again, some of that is postponement relative to having a bigger investment needed in India next year. And, therefore, this is not the time to actually address this question. The time to address that question will be at the fourth quarter evaluation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the latter part &#x2013; or the second part of the &#x2013; of your question, the launch of new GSM operators in India has created sort of another twist on the price competition scale. And we were aware that that would happen, and it's part of our plan.</p>
          <p>And as we described India when we are launching the project, we had an ARPU curve in the Indian market where we expected the further reduction in tariffs to happen. So this is part of being in a competitive marketplace. And of course what that means that a newcomer with an empty network will use in order to get traffic and customer on his network.</p>
          <p>The price mechanism though over time will probably develop differently from this as customers are entering and as spectrum of steel scares with all the operators, meaning that those that have significant customer basis and traffic volumes already in place will be sort of, to a certain extent, limited as to handle the overall market growth. And that the overall market growth will eventually be distributed among those with network capacity available.</p>
          <p>And in that sense, we need to find a balancing point also to prices in the Indian market going forward. But, as an initial offer, there will always be price being part of how to make yourself visible in such a competitive market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess just a very quick follow-up. You're launching in Q4. Was that a &#x2013; is that a full commercial launch into the end of the quarter and the various seasonal campaigns? Or is it more of a sort of soft launch at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, three short questions please. First on India, when you changed your outlook regarding the OpEx in 2009, is that simply a shift into 2010 or a genuine reduction? Second, in Norwegian fixed, the costs, which I would define for my purposes simply as revenues minus EBITDA, so net costs on a year-on-year basis have been very flat in Q1 and Q2. Now in Q3 they have been down. What happened specifically in Q3 on net costs in Norwegian fixed? Where did the reduction come from and how sustainable would you judge that reduction to be? And third, if I may, in Swedish mobile, obviously Tele2 has said they're pushing into an area of your competitive strength. Could you tell us specifically whether you are feeling the efforts that Tele2 is putting into the overlapping segments of your market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to India, I think basically the fact that the OpEx is in our guidance fourth quarter lower than previously said has something to do with sort of the timing effects of how we've been able to ramp up. I think it's too early to say that this is the permanent feature of the whole project. But on the other hand, we have been able to secure contracts and &#x2013; with vendors below sort of the estimated price levels on as we described them in the business case as such. So we have been able to create leeway for ourselves. But the profile of investments in the overall period is, as we stand now, more or less similar. But it's a time effect on them.</p>
          <p>If we then move to fixed, I don't have sort of the necessary details on the cost structure in fixed in third quarter as such, but there is a timing issue on salaries that may play a role in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the major part is basically the holiday season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And as for the Swedish Mobile, in this quarter the growth in mobile has been able to compensate for the pressure that it previously had registered on fixed voice telephony and broadband and we're happy for that. And I cannot say as of yet that we have noticed sort of a significant push from Tele2 in that respect. But it's good of them to note that they may come in that segment in the periods to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I follow-up just on the fixed costs, please? When you're saying the major impact is the holiday season, I mean my comparison is year-on-year, are you saying that in the third quarter of 2009, the holiday season had a larger impact than usual on costs? Because I was just talking on year-on-year. Year-on-year Q1 it was flat, Q2 it was flat, Q3 it was actually down by 80 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The year-on-year comparison should be &#x2013; should be okay to look at, because the holiday season is pretty similar from year-to-year. There is no change of principles between 2008 and 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So why did in the third quarter the costs in Norwegian fixed come down when it didn't happen in Q2 and didn't happen in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically there are some elements have changed, but fundamentally we're basically 35 down &#x2013; million down from last year compared to second quarter, where we were 75, no 70 down from last year. So, you're talking in deviance year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, we're basically NOK 30 million. So, and that's &#x2013; it's not a step change, so it's not any significant downwards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, the first one is a bit broad, second one much more specific. But, firstly, given the improvement in your Nordic free cash flow number, should we be expecting you can reach your two billion target in 2010, and what is the key risk to that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in Sweden, you've delivered a very strong margin this quarter. With the prospective benefit of head count cuts not coming through until 2010, do you think you can generate a margin above 30% through 2010 in Sweden? Is there any reason long-term why the margins should be below the Western European average? And how confident with head count &#x2013; head count cuts are you given the Swedish unemployment issues at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the 10 billion target, as Trond showed on the cash flow curve, is building up nicely. And we haven't been specific on the timing, but as we said on second quarter reporting, we foresee that the 10 billion is within reach when we sort of enter 2010.</p>
          <p>Most important question though is, is it sustainable going forward? Will we be able to maintain that level? And of course, we'll work actively to do that, but again also taking due consideration to the relative competitive situation in every market, which we always do.</p>
          <p>Then, Sweden margin going forward, yes, we anticipate that the effects, the full effects of the downsizing will mature and become visible in our figures in 2010. But we're not standing here and promise that the margin of 30% will be within reach that easily. That again also will depend on the competitive development. But of course we've done this in order to improve ourselves and also to find the right balance between the resources spent on both the three lines of &#x2013; the three product lines: the fixed telephony, which is sort of on the losing track, and then broadband being on the established and future track, and then of course mobile as the most important, most visible growth factor, and also looking forward to do the new network operation and the network formability to become visible from 2012 onwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just &#x2013; thanks for that. And just a follow up on the downsizing, you haven't seen any or you don't expect any major negative impact to your downsizing program given Swedish unemployment is rising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for all practical purposes, this is in fact executed as per this third quarter, sort of when we are talking about the big figures. So, this is more or less done and costs associated with this is then covered by what we report, so might be some minor effects in the fourth quarter, but those are, as I say, minor.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Two questions if I may. First of all could you comment on the what trends in the fixed business in Norway as regard to the operating trends? Access volume loss, as I'm looking at, seems to be deteriorating. DSL growth has clearly been negative now for several quarters. Is there anything that we can expect to turn those trends around in the near to medium-term? And secondly, could you just confirm how much we should have in for CapEx in the broke-up business for the fourth quarter related to the satellite launch? And should we have anything penciled in for 3G licenses in markets such as Thailand? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the effects of fixed in Norway, I don't think that we can expect those curves to turn. The DSL, the number of DSL lines in Norway has probably been at its peak. And the reason for that is that those lines not &#x2013; those lines not taken on broadband are probably will customers that will not demand broadband in the longer perspective.</p>
          <p>Then cable and fiber is being &#x2013; is taking a bigger portion of the broadband connections in Norway. So, number of connections overall is still growing, but at a much lower pace than before of course. And we consider cable internet access as being at par with fiber when it comes to customer experiences. And that is exactly what happens where both get and &#x2013; Trond already told &#x2013; is now building internet access among its cable TV customers at quite a significant and good rate. So, we don't expect those figures to turn around and grow again. And as when it comes to mobility, as such, mobile voice will still take minutes from fixed voice. We're at the percentage now soon 65, 67 to 20, what does that mean? 70, 30, okay? So, that &#x2013; then we see that we've had a almost complete transition happening over, say eight to 10 years of mobile voice taking almost all voice traffic and we expect that trend to continue, yes.</p>

So, we anticipate a successful launch. So, in that case, yes we're going to book CapEx of approximately one billion on that. The last one is 3G in Thailand. The process as we understand, it is not going to happen until beginning of next year. But as Vitak has been stating yesterday they are planning for a 3G and that plan is going ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you, good morning. I'd like to just come back to the Swedish and Danish operation, if there &#x2013; was there any impact of the restructuring program or laying off people in the third quarter or will all of that come in starting in Q4 in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, there is some slight effects of restructuring costs in Denmark. I believe it's a bit less than 50, 47 if I can remember correctly. So &#x2013; but other than that no accounting effects. There has been a lot of reorganizing throughout the Danish operations combining the brand, combining the entity into one business. So, we do expect effects coming out of that reorganization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Most of my questions have been answered. I have two questions left. Starting first with the new tower sharing agreement in India, initially you stated that the tower sharing agreement gave you access to 40,000 towers. How many towers do you get access to now? And are you committed to a certain amount of towers?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to Pakistan where we see a stabilization of the ARPU. Can you comment a little bit further on how you're seeing the market trends in Pakistan on ARPU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first tower agreement gave us the rights to a number in the range that you mentioned. However, the commitment around the first tower agreement was slightly below 15,000 towers, if I remember correctly.</p>
          <p>And this new tower agreement makes us more flexible when it comes to the coverage pattern and as a consequence the coverage quality. And it helps us complete that picture in the circles that we will start launching services.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; yes, what was your last element again? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stabilization of ARPU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stabilization of ARPU in Pakistan, yes. Well, it's difficult to say whether this is a permanent picture or not. It's a fact that the competitors in Pakistan are still at a high number and the consolidation question is still hanging around. And the economic climate or sort of the &#x2013; and the political and economic climate in Pakistan for the time being might lead us to believe that there is a bit of a caution as to run sort of a very strong campaign, run very strong investments under these kind of circumstances.</p>
          <p>You might have noticed that we in Telenor Pakistan launched the financial services to build in Pakistan, just recently called Easy Paisa and we will follow a light financial services product development path throughout the winter, which we believe will create quite a significant interest. But of course, this is a maturing type of service that needs to be built over time. And it's built up on trust and quality. And here we are very cautious as to move forward.</p>
          <p>The banking structure in Pakistan is so that a lot of people is basically un-banked. And there should be a potential to really play a role in giving the overall marketplace a great degree of efficiency when it comes to money transfers and bill payments, the way we look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think we have to take -- the next question is from Mr. James Britton of company Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. My first question is, sort of looking back to your capital markets there &#x2013; you said that you would consider disposing of non-core assets in better financial markets. Would you say financial markets have recovered to the extent where you would be willing to consider this step now?</p>
          <p>And secondly, your CapEx to sales slide, flagging the 10% level ex-India, is a point of this slide really to highlight that you think this is pretty sustainable for the next 12, 24 months under the current strategy? Or do you really feel that that level that is sort of perhaps below the normalized level of investment? And, obviously, please ignore potential lumpy license costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the first you might be right in the fact that the liquidity situation and also available credits might be quite a different quality of that as we speak compared to what was the case at the beginning of this year. But on the other hand we will dispose some assets when we're ready to do that under all circumstances. To sort of say that this has been set up or reduced is difficult to say.</p>
          <p>But there are some processes going on. As to the 10% sustainable figure I think we have to consider that 10% very strongly up against how the economic climate in the different markets will develop. And if growth comes back into the countries by usage, we will probably see such a figure grow again.</p>
          <p>But under the present circumstances we're reasonably well at 10%. But looking also on the very fact that fourth quarter would probably build up a higher figure compared to what third quarter isolated was. It's always so that in fourth quarter, there is a tendency that projects are being closed towards the year-end at a higher speed than to, I would say, third quarter closing. And here we've seen that fourth quarter comes in higher than before, but it will definitely not be at par with fourth quarter 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember that we're guiding you on 13% for the year, including a sideline though, and that means 12% throughout the year excluding that. So, in that sense I do think that the 10% have to be considered in that light as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Can I just ask one follow-up? Can you just talk about the timing of the mobile broadband CapEx tender and are you &#x2013; are you going to be holding back any big purchases until that's actually locked down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, at the capital markets today there was quite a lot made of the &#x2013; I think it was the mobile broadband CapEx tender across the Nordic region, which hopefully will deliver some material savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, that tender is going on and we don't have any news on that as of today, but of course the general comment is that we can get efficiency out of the results of that tender, which we can utilize in a good way for the operations in the three Nordic countries going forward.</p>

          <p>Oh, hi there. Two, hopefully fairly quick, questions; firstly on the domestic mobile side, could you just give us a sense of how much of the acceleration in service revenue growth is driven by any sort of economic recovery, or is that not yet really what's driving to pickup there? And then secondly, returning to the issue of fixed line and OpEx, I noticed you reduced head count in Norway by about 800 employees during the quarter, so about 7%, which is obviously quite substantial for one quarter. Is that what's driving the &#x2013; or is that a major contributor to the margin strength that we saw in the Norwegian businesses, or are we not really seeing the full run rate yet of the 800 cuts? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start on the first one, I wouldn't say that Norway is in a recovery. Norway has been not that severely impacted by the recession element that many countries have experienced. So, and I wouldn't expect sort of a boost in revenues either, from the present level in 2000 &#x2013; in the third quarter 2003. But, having said that, I think all operators in Norway have experienced that this year has not given reduced volumes on any operator in 2009. We've seen some of the two to three smaller operators disappearing from the marketplace. But that was probably because of the fact that they were not fully financed and had difficulties in building the platform. So, I think that is the characteristics of the Norwegian market, and we do not expect sort of to see significant growth or more significant reductions in that sense. And Trond?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the man years I'm trying to find out where you actually find the 800, because I cannot find all of them. In Norway we basically have no reduction in man years, we do have some in Sweden, year-over-year, though, from third quarter last year till now we have a reduction of 250 man years. And in Denmark...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was looking at, in the spreadsheet that you send out, you do number of employees and number of employees outside of Norway, and I assume the balance is number of employees in Norway, and that has gone from the 11.2 thousand &#x2013; I'm sorry, from 11,200 in Q2 to 10.4 in Q4, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot reconcile that number here actually. But fundamentally I think we are having two man years less in fixed and I do think that we have 11 more in the mobile sector. So, where those 800 comes from, I think I have to refer that to the IR afterwards.</p>

          <p>Hello. Yes, good morning all. I have four questions based on India. First, you were planning to launch services inside circle in Q4, '09. So, is that plan intact and how do you plan to go ahead with further launches in India?</p>
          <p>Second question, what's your plan as far as participation in 3G is concerned in India. Third, plan for securing long-term funding in India, and fourth, the tower sharing agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> how many <mark type="inaudible" /> and related with service areas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't quite get the second one, but maybe Trond can take that one. The launch pattern in India will be that we will start with a number of circles and there is a second wave next year, and I will not be precise on the launch pattern as such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so how many circles by Q4 '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will not be specific as of today how many circles will be included in the first round.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. But you'll be going ahead with some launches, correct?</p>

          <p>And as for the brand position, the brand that will be utilized will be Uninor and that became public a month ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I asked about the participation in 3G process &#x2013; your plans about participation in 3G auction business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, the 3G upcoming process is, as we stated, we will not be part of a nationwide 3G plan. We've stated that very clearly. We might be looking at the question circle-by-circle, and it will be very interesting to see whether it will take place in January as we &#x2013; as now is the timeline, since we've seen quite a number of delays already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Okay. The third one, the plans for securing long-term funding in India?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; the funding side in India is very much secured already, both by equity financing, as well as project financing in India.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Brief questions left only at this stage. Firstly, domestic mobile revenue growth, I believe it's the first time you've mentioned the iPhone as a contributing factor. Is it the first quarter you've seen a meaningful impact, or has it &#x2013; has takeup accelerated, and I don't assume you'll be prepared to give us any numbers for, say, of net intake or how many iPhone you have in the base.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'd just be interested in the &#x2013; whether there has been any movements in the Farimex court case, though nothing officially has been announced and thirdly, are you prepared at this stage to tell us how much you expect to spend on LTE rollout in Sweden and Norway? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's the first time we mentioned iPhone though, but you might say that the impact has now really become a visible one, so the installed base is becoming pretty material. But I don't have the details on that with me, but it's no doubt that the iPhone, generally speaking, increased &#x2013; increased usage and increased revenue. As for all the condition precedents under the writ limited deal, and to the case specifically that you mentioned, we are of no knowledge as to what kind of movement there might be around that case. But the disappearance of the Farimex case is a very clear condition precedent in the overall deal. And we are of course not prepared to, although obvious reasons what the overall LTE investments will be, that's far too early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think that was the last question from the ones participating on the phone. We have time for one question from the webcast or telephone participants on Ukraine, if I may. It's from Will Milner at Arete Research asking could you discuss the extent to which deteriorating trends at Kyivstar are economically driven, compared with rising competition. Have there been specific offers from competitors in third quarter that reduced your market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said in the presentation here, we have been able to stabilize a leakage of SIM cards that we experienced in the used segment, also on tariff pricing. But that was sort of a second quarter feature, and in third quarter we managed to stabilize that. So, to that part of your question, the answer is no. And it is also worth mentioning here that if we go and make an analysis on the ARPU figures as such, these are fairly stable throughout 2009. Meaning that one could judge from that development that the new state of the economy basically has found its level, when it comes to mobile spending under the present conditions in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. We don't have any further questions, but before we end this session, Mr. Baksaas has asked to say &#x2013; wants to say a few words, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, since Trond sort of let loose here, even describing the weather outside before he started on his presentation today, and I have been warned about doing that exactly for my 28 quarters with Telenor, it's about time to thank Trond for his 16 only quarters with Telenor, but it's quite obvious that his performance within Telenor has been noted outside the country and in that sense the Dane has &#x2013; the Danes have cast an eye on him. So, we wish you good luck with your new position, Trond. And thank you for the 16 quarters along with me. Thank you.</p>
