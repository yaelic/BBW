        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody. This is Gilberto Louren&#xE7;o speaking. Moving straight to slide number three, we can see that we delivered the best result of Banco do Brasil history for the first half of the year, R$6.3 billion. Besides that we kept our return on average close to 25% in the period. In the quarter, we reached a recurring net income of R$3.2 billion and a return on equity of above 26%.</p>
          <p>On slide number four, we show how we were able to deliver this consistent operational result with a recurring net income 40% above than they recorded in the first half 2010. The net interest income, which was responsible for 71.2% of the revenues in the first half 2010 and in the first half 2011 was even better increasing 50 bps.</p>
          <p>Our better performance was recorded by the insurance operation that came from 3.4% to 4% of the total revenue generation. One year ago, the operating expense were responsible for 50% of the total revenues of the bank, and in the first half 2011, the share dropped to 47.1%. It is also worth to highlight the loan loss provision with share in the total expense reduced from 22.3% to 19%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number five, we observe that we are still the large bank in Latin America with assets amounting more than R$900 billion. Next slide, we observe that, along with the assets, slide number six, we kept our leadership in the main segments of the Brazilian bank industry. This leadership is based on great assets, in our ability to raise funds, as we see in the deposit and asset management lines.</p>
          <p>From slide seven on, we'll see the four main drivers that led Banco do Brasil results, funding and credit, delinquency control, efficiency, and business diversification.</p>
          <p>Here on slide eight, we have the fund expansion. Banco do Brasil distribution network once again allowed the maintenance of our leadership in deposits, highlight the time deposits, which grew 21.5% LTM. Banco do Brasil also had an increased access to funding source abroad. On slide nine, we show that the amounts raised grew substantially, 22.2% in one year. Interbank fund and bond issue have presented quite good track record. Within bond issues, we have our last &#x20AC;1.5 billion subordinated debt accounting for Tier 2 capital.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we see that, besides the traditional funding, Banco do Brasil is diversifying its base mainly through agriculture and financial letters, which together grew 406% in one year.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we observe that the global spread was flat quarter-over-quarter; the risk-adjusted margin decreased 20 bps due to the first quarter's seasonal delinquency, which will be explained later.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, we have the spreads by segment. On individuals' portfolio, we observed a slight increase in spread due to the re-pricing of credit lines. In the business &#x2013; in agribusiness portfolio, the drop seen is explained by mix effect. Fast growing portfolio has been at big ticket as those of mid and large corporate in agroindustrial loans.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we can observe that Banco do Brasil kept its leadership in the credit market, with 19.6% market share. The portfolio reached R$421 billion, including private securities and guarantee granted. We got a 6% growth in the quarter and more than 20% LTM.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, we have the individual portfolio where, once again, we can see the increase in operation with lower risk profiles, such as those linked to payrolls, auto loans and mortgage. Those operation represent more than 79% of the total portfolio to individuals.</p>
          <p>Regarding the partnership with Banco Votorantim on slide 15, we observe that Banco Votorantim's shares in the car financing market origination reached 21.9%. The production of auto and payroll loans of that bank started to grow again after the impact from the adoption of macroprudential measures, achieving R$8.2 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Talking about mortgage on slide 16, we have the disbursement and contracts to individuals since the second quarter 2010. Q2 disbursements were 2.5 times higher than in the quarter last year &#x2013; the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Next slide, we have mortgage information, but to the business segment. As you can see, the number of contracts increased three times in one year, while the disbursements grew 3.4 times.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 18, we have the evolution of business portfolio which highlights the securities and investment line, which became 31% of the total portfolio from 25.9% last year.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide 19, we have the breakdown of the business portfolio. Besides the increase in both lines, please observe that the strongest growth was in the operation with mid and large companies, which explain the spread reduction for those operations as mentioned before.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, on SME segments we are focused on operation with collateral, that's the case of guarantee fund called FGO. In June 2011, there were more than 437,000 operation with this collateral, which reached the balance of R$8.2 billion, or 13.7%, of the total loans granted to SME in Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Banco do Brasil presents abroad its fundamental to support a Brazilian foreign trade as we can see in slide 21. It'll be remain as leader in import and export market and also in trading finance. Slide 22 brings us the quarterly disbursement of investment loan, which reached R$7.5 billion Q2. We would like to highlight once again that investment finance will bring great opportunities to Brazilian bank the next year as an important cross-selling driver.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, we present a quarterly disbursement of BNDES Card, a product in each Banco do Brasil is a wide range leader in terms of amount disbursed, the number of cards and transactions made.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 shows us the disbursement with funding from the Constitutional Fund for Financing of the Center-West and Midwest Fund in Brazil, FCO, surpassed R$1.2 billion in second quarter 2011. The next slide brings us some information about agro business portfolio, Banco do Brasil has a stake of 62% in the market, being the major partner of Brazilian agro business. The portfolio has increased in a consistent way with highlight to corporate loans, which in one year grew more than 28% and became 35.5% of the total book of Agribusiness.</p>
          <p>Slide 26, brings us the breakdown of Banco do Brasil credit disbursement to the crop since crop 2007 and 2008. To the next crop, crop 2011 or 2012, we estimate a growth of almost 30% in investment line when compared to the previous quarter. Actually, we are planning to lend R$45.7 billion for that crop.</p>
          <p>The slide 27 shows us that investment in Agribusiness with granting more efficiency through the production better seeds, fertilizers and machineries have made both the increase in the productivity in the sector.</p>
          <p>The slide 28 shows us the main cultures bring good profitability to producers, as soybean with 54% margin, and corn with 56% margins both for this last crop, 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 summarized our expectation to the agri business for the next crop. We expect &#x2013; continuity in the margin behavior, good price and cost under control, besides a favorable weather. All of these together should benefit the producers and bring new opportunities to Banco do Brasil, including improvement in the book quality.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 30, we have the risk quality evolution. The operation with better risk, AA-C, came from 92.5% in June last year to 93.6% this year. A consequence of the quality of loans granted by Banco do Brasil. Also regarding the quality of the portfolio slide 31 brings the delinquency and confirms the strategy of concentrating the book in the lower risk operation. The NPL ratios are sustainable and better than those presented by Brazilian bank and increasing to attain 2% in June 2011.</p>
          <p>The slide 32 pictures the delinquency by portfolio. Steadiness in individuals' book and a slight worsening of 20 bps in the corporate loans pretty much clear the outstanding decrease in Agribusiness NPL where the ratio dropped by half quarter-over-quarter. This <mark type="ph" /> behavioral rate reflects (12:30) the decrease in the amount of rolled over operation in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>I'd like to drag your attention to the next slide, slide number 33. Many were wondering what would &#x2013; could explain the provision expense increase comparing Q2 and Q1. The graph is picturing a GAAP analysis, comparing the early delinquency of the previous quarter with the changes in the worst risk D-H in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the seasonal hike of the early delinquency, those between 15 days to 89 days of the first quarter 2011, drove the growth verified in the risk D-H in the second quarter 2011. As a result, it also explained why we got that 15% rise in the provision expenses quarter-over-quarter. On the other hand, we have a already seen a decrease in the current early delinquency of the bank that may be possible, positively supportive for the following quarters, I mean we accounted March 2011, 1.9%, 15 to 89 days and now it decreased to 1.7%, 15 to 89 days at June 2011.</p>
          <p>In slide 34, moreover, we see that the coverage ratio of past due loans over 90 days was more than 226% quiet above the bank industry that accounted 167%.</p>
          <p>On slide 35, we observed that the focus on quality service, part of our Retail Transformation Program is already reflects on the increase in the number of our employees in the distribution network. I mean in the branches, doing business with our customer base. The share of employees working at branches was 75.3%, while June last year, 73.6%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 36, we have the commercial revenues that comprised net interest income, fee income, insurance income, divide per customer, which increased 11% in one year, also a consequence of the Retail Transformation Program.</p>
          <p>And all of this has a consequence to Banco do Brasil cost income ratio. As we can see on slide 37, the ratio improves every quarter. In the second quarter it was below 40%, reflecting synergy gains of recent acquisitions and a strict cost control. We recently restructure our insurance area, included reorganization of all of our affiliated companies and these are bringing good results.</p>
          <p>On slide 38 we see that the insurance results in Banco do Brasil increased almost 30% in one year. In slide 39 we see a great future to the insurance business in Banco do Brasil. Before the partnership with Mapfre, Banco do Brasil had a market share of 16.5% in the insurance business, including pension plans and savings linked to lottery. With the partnership, the market share increased to 20.3%, very, very close to the leaders.</p>
          <p>And on slide 40, we have the comparison, only considering personal insurance; life insurance, land insurance, and personal accident. In this case the partnership with Mapfre would be the market leader.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 41, we observed that the cards billings grew more than 28% in one year. The expansion of the business in segment was important to guarantee the increase in fee income and market share, which came from 20.3% to 21.1% at the end of June 2011.</p>
          <p>One slide 42, we observed a consolidation of Banco do Brasil and capital market with leadership in fixed-income operation. Talking about the internationalization on slide 43, we have some pictures of our brand, of our branch in New York, new branch in New York.</p>
          <p>On slide 44, we bring some information of Banco Patagonia. We expect to reinforce Banco Patagonia's position in corporate market in order to turn it in the first Bank of Brazilian country in Argentina.</p>
          <p>From slide 45 to slide 51, we have the multiple channels offered by Banco do Brasil to its customers, from the beach to several communities spread around the country using boats or mobile phones to provide more comfort in service to our customer base.</p>
          <p>Finally, as we can see on slide 52, our most recent movement Banco Postal. We have Banco do Brasil distribution network in the Brazilian municipalities before and after Banco Postal. We will be from January 2012 positioned to be in 96% Brazilian municipalities.</p>
          <p>On slide 53, we have the BIS ratio reached &#x2013; at the end of June reached 14.4% with Tier 1 capital representing 11.1%, this ratio would allow Banco do Brasil to expand its credit portfolio by R$157 billion. Finally on slide 54, we have our performance compared to the estimates from our guidance, which led us to review some of them. We changed the estimates to credit portfolio, while we reduced the growth range to the total individual and business portfolio. We increased the growth range to agribusiness portfolio. Part of the credit demand from large companies being met by agri-industrial credit lines and also by private securities, which explains the adjustment of the business portfolio and also of the agribusiness portfolio.</p>
          <p>We also reviewed the admin expense &#x2013; SG&amp;A expense guidance, which had a performance &#x2013; quite good performance in the first half 2011 far below the estimates. The guidance came from 10% to 13%, to 9% to 12%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about the items that do not reach &#x2013; do not make any change. For net interest income, which estimate between 16% to 20%, we expect the expansion of the earning asset during the 2011, as well as the gradual incorporation of the reprice effect in our credit portfolio to reach this range of 16% to 20% in that item.</p>
          <p>Regarding credit cost, allowance for loan losses, we maintained a guidance between 3.3% to 3.7%, in order to be conservative that the way we'd like to see our credit portfolio, so to maintain quite got good level of provision to prevent from delinquency.</p>
          <p>To fee income &#x2013; related to fee income, the expectation also to deploy 12% to 17%, of course, we expect to see it <mark type="ph" /> ramping (21:07) in the second part of the year. So, those were the information I would like to share with you. Now, we can move on to the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Thank you for attention.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Excuse me. Mr. Boris Molina with Santander has a question. Mr. Molina, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you so much, and thanks for taking my question, Gilberto. I had a question regarding &#x2013; a couple of questions. The first one regarding asset quality, you noticed that &#x2013; a delinquency increase in the company loan portfolio. I just wanted to know what type of companies, in which sectors, which &#x2013; were they large companies or SMEs? And what were the drivers behind this increase and how do you expect this going forward?</p>
          <p>And secondly, regarding your allowance for loan losses, you kept the guidance despite that asset quality has been performing pretty well. If we were to meet this guidance provisions in the second and &#x2013; in the third and fourth quarter, we have to rise very sharply. So, I don't know what underlies your decision to keep this guidance. I mean, are you expecting to increase your coverage ratio even further? What is the underlying expectation for non-performing loans or the 2H loans that drives this expectation?</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding Patagonia, you consolidated the Patagonia in the second quarter. What is the impact on your capital ratios? Are these loans included in your risk-weighted assets or are you deducting them from risk-weighted assets or not consolidating as you did with Banco Votorantim? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Boris. Talking about delinquency, if you take a look at the breakdown in the company, the bulk of the growth in the delinquency was in SMEs, but it was the same movement that we have in our portfolio that was seasonal. The early delinquency, we have a hiccup in the first quarter and we expect to see a decrease in the second quarter in the early delinquencies. So, taking a look the 90 days delinquencies, the bulk was in SMEs, but the trend is the same as the total portfolio, to see improvement in the following quarters because of this seasonal effect that we have in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Talking about the <mark type="ph" /> guiding (23:47) next provision expenses credit costs 3.3% to 3.7%, we got 3%, that you're right. We are far from reaching the low end of the guidance, but our goal is to maintain this guidance in that level, because last year we have quite good year and we accounted 3.3%. So, behind this guidance, the expectation's to have provision in Banco do Brasil at least fall in the region of our credit portfolio. So, there is no increase in the provision expenses because of any deterioration, okay. So, behind this guidance is, same old, same old that we have last year in terms of a credit quality.</p>
          <p>Talking about the calculation of BIS ratio; in Banco Patagonia, that's different than Banco Votorantim. Banco Votorantim is consolidated proportionally, and Banco Patagonia is fully consolidated. We have 100% Banco Patagonia in Banco do Brasil balance sheet. So, we have minority interest in our balance sheet when it comes to Banco Patagonia. It's not the case of Banco Votorantim, when we have, for BIS purpose, only the equity amount, okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Gilberto. I have a couple of questions on your solid results for the quarter. The first one is on Banco Votorantim. We saw the bank's results suffer very significantly in the quarter on the back of significantly higher provision expenses. I was wondering if you could comment a bit about what's going on there, if we should continue to see the bank deliver weak profitability, if the provision expenses or the asset quality issues that hurt the bank this quarter is something that are recurring, or something that we should see go away in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with your guidance that you have in slide 54. You lower the loan growth expectations, individuals and corporate loan growth, however, you increased expectations for agribusiness, which is a lower-margin portfolio, and you do not lower your net interest income growth expectations. I was wondering if there is something there that I'm missing, or if there will be some other way that this net interest income will expand throughout the year, or if this is really all due to the increasing margins that you expect to see in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to take your question by the last one, okay? So, we measure our net interest income fall in the region of the growth that we have in our earning assets. And the earning asset of the bank tends to grow, fall in the region of our deposit base. So, probably, you're going to have earning assets growing 14% to 18%, which could maintain this, quite feasible this level, net interest income consider the hike in interest rate that we have in the country.</p>
          <p>But talking about the credit portfolio, along with this reduction, we have to have &#x2013; bear in mind the repricing process that we have in, especially, individual portfolio. Individual portfolio of Banco do Brasil has an average duration of 18 months, so we're going to be able to reprice 60% of the total book until the end of this year. So, we're going to have recovery margin as we start to see, because individual portfolio, if I'm not wrong, increased its margin from 15.3% to 15.4%. And so, that then tends to be the case for the following quarters. So, that's why we maintain our guidance when it comes to net interest income.</p>
          <p>Talking about Banco Votorantim, what we saw in Banco Votorantim was an increase in its provision expenses on back of deterioration its portfolio, I would say to you that the thing that we have, of course, more intense than Banco do Brasil, but the same seasonal effect that we have, early delinquency hike in the first quarter kind of contaminating the worst risk in the second quarter and then more provision because of it. Some adjustments that we have in methodology in Banco Votorantim to be more close to our methodology also drag more provision in that bank.</p>
          <p>So, poor result was mainly because of this movement related to provision. We start to see early delinquency in Banco Votorantim improving, along with better shape in their business, because, as I mentioned during the presentation, the production of the bank start to increase also. If you take a look at the graph, we were originating in a pace of R$6 billion something per quarter and now we are in a pace of R$8.2 billion per quarter. So Banco Votorantim start to be back again, growing to a very good level of production.</p>
          <p>Deterioration in its portfolio is quite manageable, consider the recent delinquencies we have seen in the bank. So that &#x2013; we are in the bank. Of course, Banco Votorantim has a quite good challenge to fall in the region of Banco do Brasil in terms of profitability, but we're going to be there to follow and to pursue it, okay.</p>

          <p>We have a question from the line of Marcelo Telles with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Two questions, one just a follow-up on Banco Votorantim. Would be fair to &#x2013; given that a lot of the increase, as you said, was due to the alignment of credit risk criteria in, obviously, Votorantim and Banco do Brasil. Is it fair to expect a decline in the provisions for Votorantim in the third quarter of the year, I mean in absolute terms, given that, most like, there was kind of a non-recurring provision expense there?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding Previ. I mean, of course &#x2013; given that the bigger markets sell off, probably there was a decline in your surplus. My question is more an accounting one. What happens if the amount of surplus is actually lower than the amount of surplus you have already recognized in your balance sheet? Do you have to amortize that difference over time, or you have to do all at once, or you amortize based on the remaining time for retirement? If you could clarify on that, that would be great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcelo. Talking about Banco Votorantim alignment with Banco do Brasil, the bulk of it happened during the second quarter. So there is a few remaining alignment to our methodologies. So the provision expense we follow the quality of the portfolio of that bank, okay, that has improving in the second quarter, consider the early delinquency we have seen in that portfolio.</p>
          <p>Talking about Previ, and, of course, we bear in mind that's only an exercise, okay. It's not the case, because to have this situation of reduction in the surplus of Previ, it's quite as &#x2013; it's quite difficult to have considered the condition, even with this condition in the market that we have nowadays. If you by any chance on an exercise please &#x2013; if you by any chance reduce the surplus below the assets that we have already accounted, we have to write-off, okay, to match the fair value of this surplus. That's the case. We have to impair the assets.</p>
          <p>But we do it, consider this corridor method, okay. We can have a range of 5% of the assets or the liability. We're going to follow this range of 5%. If by any chance non-recognized losses are below 5% of the total assets or the total liabilities the bigger of them, we're going to &#x2013; we have to do nothing, okay. If by any chance the non-recognized losses surpass 5% of this amount, then we have to start to amortize the assets. That's the way it works.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you do not amortize all at once, right? You amortize based &#x2013; the same way that you divide, let's say, your surplus by the amount of years. It's valid also on the downside as well. So it's not &#x2013; it's &#x2013; would be every half, every &#x2013; at the end of every semester, you'd have to amortize.</p>

          <p>I'd like to add something about Banco Votorantim. The priority there is to increase the ROE of the bank. That is, given the 13% level in comparison with Banco do Brasil 24%, or above 20%. That's why our focus is to be &#x2013; even with the focus to increase the ROE of the bank, we keep the conservative approach, talking about the provision charge. That's why we put in the same level as Banco do Brasil. We didn't expect any kind of increase in the second &#x2013; some slight increase in the final process &#x2013; to finalize this process. But again, the focus there is to keep the same level and in the hopes so, to increase the middle market. We are doing a very good job talking about the middle markets there and to keep the same level, this 22%, in the market share of <mark type="ph" /> card money (34:50).</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Let me ask you two questions. The first is on asset quality. I just want to go back to this topic. I think you made it clear that you expect asset quality to remain stable. But at the same time, you do expect to be increasing the amounts that you provision. So just trying to understand why the need to be increasing provisions as a percentage of loans since you already have such a robust coverage ratio, probably one of the best in the industry today? And what kind of macroeconomic variables do you watch when you say that you expect asset quality to remain stable. Basically what I'm trying to get at it is what should we be worried about? Is it if we see a pickup in unemployment? Is it if GDP slows down? What you think is the key variable for asset quality going forward?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is unrelated. It has to do more with costs. You have shown very good cost control and then you also reduced your guidance for expense growth for this year. I wanted to know if this reduction in guidance has anything to do with the acquisition of Banco Postal because now you won't have to open as many branches as you were planning or what's really behind this reduction in your expense growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ivan, if you wish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mario, talking about the deterioration, if you &#x2013; we didn't expect any kind of deterioration talking about the credit quality of the bank. Why? Because we are more close to the quality of the assets that we originate. Talking about the, for example, the credit portfolio related to any of those, we are focused on car finance, payroll finance, mortgage that we have the collateral. That's why it is different our behavior in comparison with the average in the market. If there is a huge deterioration in this scenario for the future it will affect the bank, but it will affect the whole market.</p>
          <p>What we expect is to be in a better situation in comparison with our peers, because we choose in the past to do these new assets based on the line spread &#x2013; line that we have the collateral. In my opinion, the general measures that you mentioned in the unemployment ratio, the GDP growth and everything, there are measures that we always follow. But again, we are pretty confident that &#x2013; and I can tell you that in July we have the same NPL ratio related to 90 days and the same NPL ratio 2%. That's why we are confident that we will have a better performance in comparison with the markets in general, especially our main competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but, Ivan, on your guidance, right, you're guiding for allowance for loan losses to represent between 3.3% and 3.7% of your loan book, while they have represented only 3% so far. So basically you are expecting to be increasing your provisions quite sharply in the second half of the year even though your coverage ratio is already 227% of NPL. So I just want to understand this disconnect. It seems like a very comfortable asset quality, but at the same time you increasing provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't expect to increase provisions. We are pretty confident about again &#x2013; about the quality of our assets, but I can tell it's a conservative approach &#x2013; it's a conservative approach. Only, we are only doing these because we would like to see what is going to happen especially with this scenario that is you know there is a lot of volatility right now, but this is only because of that. We are pretty confident about the quality assets inside Banco do Brasil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the question then on the costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost is not basically on the &#x2013; we gain efficiency because of these synergies. We acquired Banco Nossa Caixa and we promised that we will increase and you get all the synergies that we promised. We are able to do these, and we are always concerned about the <mark type="ph" /> general expenses inside the bank, why (39:47), because we believe that in the future, we need to build a bank, not basically in this actual level of the spreads in Brazil.</p>
          <p>The spreads in Brazil, the trend in our opinion in the future will go down. And because of that, we need to build a bank with the profitability or with efficient not based in this spread, basically on the spread in the future that will go down. That's why we invest a lot in technology. And that's why in Banco Postal, we had a very good opportunity not only to reduce the cost, it's a very good approach.</p>
          <p>But the most important thing, talking about Banco Postal is to increase the revenues and increase the products per customer that we have now inside Banco do Brasil. We have 35 million customers on classes, on Class C, D and E, and we'd like to increase the revenues with these customers that we have now. We don't need to acquire this customer we have now. That's why Banco Postal we believe is a very good opportunity not only to increase our branch network, but to increase the profitability with the customers that we have now inside the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But does this acquisition though &#x2013; does it change at all your guidance that you had given previously to the market about branch expansions, should we then assume that you won't need to open as many branches as you originally were guiding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you can assume this. We postponed a lot of investments because of Banco Postal, okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have actually follow-up questions on Previ's surplus results. Is there any chance of reevaluating the current criteria in order to, no longer any mark-to-market Previ's assets in order to reduce any volatility in the bank's results? And also, it's a technical doubt, I mean any &#x2013; do you apply the corridor rule on odd quarters too in the third and first quarter? Or you only apply the corridor rule on the end of each semester? And then I'll make my second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We apply the corridor rules only in the end of each semester. We &#x2013; reassessing in the total assets and the liabilities. Okay, during the first and the third quarter, what we have, of course during the year, what we have is the <mark type="ph" /> appli data (42:37) revenue, the application of the interest rate and inflation of the asset and the liability side. So when we assess the assets and the liabilities at the end of June and December, then we apply the corridor rules. Ivan, do you have any other comments on Regina question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first point was Regina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any chance of reevaluating this criteria, I mean change their mind, maybe applying the rule even on this odd quarters or even changing not to make the mark-to-market anymore, I mean in order to reduce volatility, I mean is there any point on the regulation behind this recognition that would allow you to change the criteria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have to follow the regulation established to that purpose, okay. So that's the Regulation 600 of CVM and the Regulation 26 of the pension plans &#x2013; pension fund agency, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question is regarding the guidance for loan growth that we have seen the Banco Postal, very good loan growth in there for the quarter, above 5% in &#x2013; it was even above the market average. But you reduced a little bit the loan growth guidance, is there any specific portfolio that you expect to decelerate? Maybe vehicle financing given the higher NPL ratios in <mark type="ph" /> per quarter (44:18) or it's going to be more across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regina, bear in mind that the comparison that we have when we <mark type="ph" /> grant (44:30) the guidance was with December 2010 and December 2010 is pretty much higher than June. We gave this number to the market 12 months performance, last 12 months performance. But when compared to December last year, the growth is slower. So of course, we maintain the same approach in increasing more individual user portfolio, okay.</p>
          <p>In Agribusiness, the change was the behavior in &#x2013; and in corporate loans, that's the major change. Relatively speaking, the approach is the same, increasing more individual portfolio in order to have a better yield in our portfolio and those of course more protected portfolio in individual side. In corporate loans, we have &#x2013; we got a better shape in terms of growth, I mean in SMEs. SMEs during this quarter increased 6%. So, that's to deploy some recovery, to expect to have more growth in SMEs when it comes to corporate loans, so, in total <mark type="ph" /> booked individuals falling by SMEs portfolio (45:42).</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. First question, I also have a follow-up, a follow-up on Previ, what is the expected gain, the expected monthly gain that you expect to have in the second half by applying the expected returns and cost on actuarial assets and liabilities given the decline in the Previ surplus in the first half? What is the monthly gain that you expect to have in the second half?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>More or less R$176 million, so a little bit lower than what you had obviously in the first half. And then secondly, on your capital position, UPIS did increase 30 bps, and I know in the past, you've indicated that how Basel III will be implemented, will be an important &#x2013; will obviously be important for what your capital position may look like starting next year. Any update in terms of how you're viewing your capital position today, and also how you think the regulators are thinking about Basel III? Especially with the global backdrop being as uncertain as it is, do you think that perhaps that will play a role in their minds in terms of maybe implementing it a little bit less harshly than maybe they thought they were going to implement it? Just if you can provide us with any kind of thoughts about your capital and Basel III?</p>
