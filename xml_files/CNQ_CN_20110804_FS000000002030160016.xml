          <p>All participants thank you for standing by. Your conference is ready to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources 2011 Second Quarter Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead Mr. Langille.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Thank you for attending this conference call where we will discuss our second quarter 2011 results and also update our plans for the second half of 2011 and beyond as we continue to develop our strong focused asset base.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today are Allan Markin, our Chairman; Steve Laut, our President; R&#xE9;al Doucet and Peter Janson, our Senior Vice Presidents at our Horizon Oil Sands Mining Operations; and Doug Proll, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press release and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars and production reserves are both expressed as before royalties, unless otherwise stated. I'll make some initial comments before I turn the call over to the other participants.</p>
          <p>Our exploration and production asset base continued to provide excellent operating and financial results during the second quarter. Our production of natural gas and all elements of our crude oil portfolio whether it be light oil and NGLs, cold heavy oil or hot heavy oil achieved significant and strong levels of production despite the challenges Mother Nature threw at us during the second quarter. Steve will give more details of each of these areas in his review of operations.</p>
          <p>The level of cash flow reached in the second quarter exceeded our CapEx and of course was negatively affected by the suspension of production at our mining project. As Steve, R&#xE9;al and Peter will detail, we are in the final stages of recommencing production from this world-class project.</p>
          <p>We have had the opportunity to participate in some additional tuck-in acquisitions and as a result have increased our 2011 acquisition expenditure budget to a total of $950 million. These acquisitions will provide additional production and cash flow through the latter quarter of 2011 and into 2012 and give us more opportunities to create further values as we synergize operations with our operations in the areas that the acquisitions cover.</p>
          <p>Our longer-term growth projects in our thermal and mining oil projects continue to be developed in our focused cost control manner. Our production and cash flows are strong enough that we are able to spend a significant amount of our yearly CapEx on projects which do not result in same year production growth, but provide a stable longer life production base for many future years.</p>
          <p>Before we turn the call &#x2013; the meeting over to Steve, Allan do you want to make some additional comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, John. Good morning. The first half of 2011 demonstrated the benefits of a diverse asset base. Despite challenging conditions throughout Western Canada with forest fires and floods, we are able to meet guidance and generate solid cash flow results.</p>
          <p>In Q2, our high return crude oil projects generated outstanding results. Our primary heavy oil operations achieved record average quarterly production of over 101,000 barrels per day, while thermal crude oil production averaged 127,000 barrels per day in June, in part due to pad additions and excellent overall performance. In the North Sea, production exceeded expectations as a result of strong performance from our Ninian field and we continued to deliver solid results from our liquids rich Septimus Montney shale gas play in Northeast British Columbia and continue to optimize operations across our vast natural gas asset base.</p>
          <p>Production at our Horizon Oil Sands mining and upgrading is scheduled to recommence in two, three weeks. The breadth of our capital allocation choices continue to put Canadian Natural in a strong position to create significant value for its shareholders.</p>
          <p>Over to you Steve.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al, and good morning everyone. As both John and Al have said the second quarter was strong especially considering we were down at Horizon and were somewhat impacted by the forest fires and flooding during the quarter. It's not surprising that Canadian Natural can withstand these events as we are in a great position few in our peer group can claim. Can't complain.</p>
          <p>We are financially strong, we have a strong management team that is very return-on-capital focused and have a well balanced from diversified asset base. Most importantly, we have strong operational, technical and financial teams with high levels of expertise and the ability to execute our well defined yet flexible plan to concurrently deliver production and value growth in the near, mid and long-term, transition our production mix to a longer light and more sustainable production and cash flow mix, all well generating free cash flow throughout.</p>
          <p>Our ability to grow production and value and still generate free cash flow is what sets us apart from our peers. Our ability to generate significant free cash flow on an ever-increasing sustainable basis will help Canadian Natural continue our track record of increasing dividends on a yearly basis and if available make opportunistic acquisitions if they make sense and add value.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's assets are well balanced. When Horizon comes back on within weeks we'll be roughly 35% light and synthetic oil, 35% heavy, and 30% gas. Our assets are vast and we have deep inventories in each component of our business. This provides us not only with the opportunity to effectively allocate capital to maximize value and returns on capital, but the ability to significantly leverage technology to generate even greater value going forward.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's primary heavy oil assets generate the highest return on capital in our portfolio, a direct result of our dominant land and infrastructure position with 8500 wells in inventory and our very effective operations. In 2011, we'll grow our primary heavy oil production 13% to roughly 104,000 barrels a day and have the ability to grow production by 10% for the next 3 years or more at 10% or more, generating significant free cash flow and value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>On top of this value growth, we have significant potential on our lands to leverage technology to generate even greater value. As you know, oil recovery factors are between 10% and 15% in primary heavy oil production, which means we have 8.5 billon barrels of heavy oil on our lands that we've already developed. If we can develop technology that can increase recovery another 12%, this creates another additional 1 billion barrels of recovered oil to Canadian Natural.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there's a huge technology upside in primary heavy oil and we are working on a number of technologies to create or capture this upside. We are in the very early stages of technology development and it will likely take some time before technology can be applied commercially.</p>
          <p>Light oil and liquids production in Canada started to grow 15% in 2011 to 55,000 barrels a day and we have the ability to grow production another 15% in 2012 with slightly lower growth rates in 2013 and beyond as our EOR projects take some time to kick in. Canadian Natural has a large light oil land holdings in Canada and as you know the light oil basin in Canada is a mature basin. However with the advancement in technology and higher oil prices, we're able to implement this technology to increase recovery and production over the mid and long term, creating significant value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we'll target the drilling of 146 light oil wells, are implementing several EOR projects and optimizations that include CO2 flooding, alkaline surfactant polymer flooding, water flooding and the utilization of multi-frac horizontal wells in 15 different pools across Western Canada.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our world-class oil pool with 4.1 billion barrels of oil in place and 550 million barrels recoverable with our highly successful leading edge polymer flood, in the polymer flooded areas we expect 25% recovery and overall for the pool about 17% recovery.  As we continue to roll out the polymer flood, we expect to ultimately take production to 70,000 to 80,000 barrel a day level.</p>
          <p>As we discussed in previous conference calls, we are seeing slow response in the southern portion of pool, which is a bad news, good news story. The bad news is that production will not ramp up at the same rate as previously expected. The good news is that that slow response is a result of greater polymer sweep conformance, which will ultimately lead to higher oil recoveries, potentially in some areas in the south to recoveries approaching 35%. Production is expected exit 2011 at about 47,000 barrels a day or 16% over 210 exit rates.</p>
          <p>We are experiencing some regulatory delays at Pelican and at this point, we do not expect the delays will impact our 2011 forecast but may impact drilling plans in 2012. All information required by the regulators should be available in September for the regulators to address potential cap rock concerns that they have.</p>
          <p>We have had a great success at Pelican Lake, however we are still in steep part of learning curve and we believe that there is significant room to optimize performance and costs. Our plan is to convert Pelican over to the polymer flood in a staged manner with 54% of the pool converted by the end of 2011 and reaching 71% by 2013.</p>
          <p>We'll also expand the facility in stages: capacity was increased to 52,000 barrels in 2010 and will go to 68,000 in 2011 and then 106,000 by 2012 as we prepare for that wall of polymer-driven production in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international operations, our strategy is to maintain our existing operations and convert our undeveloped resources as slots become available on the platforms. We'll also progress <mark type="ph" /> near (10:51) pool development in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire and progress our Big E exploration prospect in South Africa. It's important to point out that our international operations are a major driver of free cash flow generation for Canadian Natural.</p>
          <p>Our international operations generate significant free cash flow. Although international only accounts for 10% of our production, it generates 25% of the company's free cash flow. However, this is severely eroded with a tax change in the UK. As you all know the UK government increased the taxation rate by 24%. As a result, the economics of doing business in the UK North Sea has been significantly eroded. This tax increase has caused Canadian Natural to allocate capital elsewhere in our portfolio. As a result, production will decline in North Sea in 2011 and 2012. Previously we had expected to grow production in 2012. If and when this fiscal regime is modified in UK North Sea, Canadian Natural has the ability to allocate capital to value-adding activities.</p>
          <p>In C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, Baobab and Espoir production continues to be on track to forecast and will continue to decline somewhat as the water flow matures and until infill drilling begins in 2013.</p>
          <p>At our Olowi field in Gabon we have been able to repair the mid-water arch support for the pipeline risers. Platform C is on production, and we expect platform A and B to commence production this fall. We had previously expected production to be shut in until year-end. It's important to note that with the exception of Olowi, offshore West Africa had some of the highest returns on our capital projects in our portfolio and generated significant free cash flow for Canadian Natural.</p>
          <p>Turning to gas in Canada, as you know our look for natural gas in North America has been very bearish and we believe the market will be oversupplied for two to seven years. Therefore in this environment it is paramount to be the most effective and efficient gas producer and Canadian Natural is an effective producer.</p>
          <p>Our overall strategy for gas is to leverage our dominant infrastructure and land base, maintain our position as the most effective producer and continue to strengthen our unconventional light and tight gas asset base by delineating new and emerging plays and leveraging new technology to open up additional resources, lower costs and ultimately position ourselves for strengthening gas prices when they arrive.</p>
          <p>We have, over time, quietly acquired 650,000 acres of Montney lands at low cost, giving Canadian Natural one of the largest Montney land bases in Canada. Septimus is our first Montney development. Production is at 60 million a day and 1,800 barrels a day of liquids, well above the 50 million a day design capacity of the plant. Reserves are tracking at 6 Bcf per well, up from the expected 4 Bcf a well. And Septimus is a liquid-rich at 30 barrels a million. And with the completion of a pipeline to deep-cut facilities should reach 50 barrels a million of liquids by November.</p>
          <p>We are currently drilling eight more wells this year, which will come on at the end of the year to keep the plant full. Septimus production performance has been very strong, and we'll be able to expand the plant to 200 million cubic feet a day and 10,000 barrels a day of liquids if we choose to allocate capital to Septimus. A decision to expand the Septimus plant in 2012 will be made towards the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>With the excellent results from Septimus and the strong cost controls, Septimus development now competes with our oil projects at $3.50 AECO gas price. As always is the case, we remain very selective on the acquisition front. However, if opportunistic acquisitions are available and we can see that they can add value, we will as we have in 2010, cash for these opportunities. As you'll see from our guidance, we have increased the acquisition capital to $950 million for 2011. We have to-date acquired roughly 142 million cubic feet a day of gas and about 3,000 barrels a day of liquid or 26,800 BOEs a day at an average cost of around $35,000 a flowing barrel. The vast majority of these acquisitions are expected to close in later in Q3. All these acquisitions are within our core area, and we're able to quickly capture synergies to drive their value.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the final two cornerstone assets in our portfolio that'll contribute to the most to the long-term sustainable production and create significant value for Canadian Natural shareholders: thermal or in situ heavy oil; and Horizon.</p>
          <p>Starting with our thermal heavy oil. Canadian Natural has a vast and superior thermal heavy oil asset base, where we have up to &#x2013; a dominant land position with over 1.1 million acres of high-quality undeveloped land. Canadian Natural's thermal heavy oil assets contain over 78 billion barrels of bitumen in place and over 8.5 billion barrels recoverable. It's important to point out that thermal recovery mechanisms are still on a very steep part of the technology curve, and I would expect over time we will not only be able to increase recoverable reserves past 8.5 billion barrels, but improve cost efficiencies going forward. Our thermal assets have huge value and huge technology upside value.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is taking a very disciplined step-wise and cost-effective plan to develop these resources, with production steps of between 30,000 and 60,000 barrels a day every two to three years, ultimately taking production capacity to over 480,000 barrels a day. Production in 2011 will average 100,000 barrels a day, with expected peaks and troughs in the cyclic process, and we're just coming off a record 127,000-barrel a day production month in June.</p>
          <p>We continue to drill additional production pads in Primrose to further the development of Primrose South and Primrose East. These developments are highly economic, as we add production capacity at 13,000 per flowing barrel. At Primrose East, we're drilling six pads that will deliver cyclic production of roughly 20,000 barrels a day in 2012 and ramp up to a peak in the cycle in 2013 at 30,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>At Primrose South, we're developing three pads that will see cyclic production at 15,000 barrels a day in 2012 and ramp up to 18,000 in 2013. As with all large and centralized thermal developments, the incremental cost to add production is very low, and we were able to leverage the Primrose fluid treatment and steam generations facilities previously built.</p>
          <p>We've also begun to start up of additional McMurray SAGD pad at Wolf Lake, which is also connected to Primrose infrastructure and will deliver production to ramp up to about 5,000 barrels a day by 2013. McMurray at Wolf Lake is a poor-quality reservoir compared to what we're developing at Kirby and will present many challenges, which will allow us to test and optimize start-up procedures at Kirby.</p>
          <p>And at Kirby, which is the next major step in Canadian Natural's defined plan to develop 480,000 barrels a day of thermal production capacity, we'll develop Kirby in three phases, as well as the debottleneck opportunities for the South down the road. We have over 1.5 billion barrels in place and 500 million barrels to recover in the Kirby development. Kirby South is expected to peak at 40,000 barrels a day &#x2013; Kirby South Phase 1. And the overall Kirby South, North and debottlenecking expansions is expected to result in 140,000 barrels a day of production capacity.</p>
          <p>The Kirby South Phase 1 plan is to build a processing plant capable of processing 118,000 barrels a day of water, generating 118,000 barrels a day of steam and treat 40,000 barrels a day of oil. The additional development would include 47 SAGD well pairs, 16 of which we'll drill this year, seven service pads and 5.2 kilometers of pipe. The capital costs will be $1.2 billion or $31,250 per barrel, flowing barrel a day. We anticipate we'll be able to leverage this initial infrastructure for further phases &#x2013; future phases, bringing down the capital costs per flowing barrel, assuming, of course, cost inflation remains in check.</p>
          <p>We are on track at Kirby South Phase 1. All major equipment has been ordered. Overall, the project is 19% complete. Engineering and construction are on schedule and costs are tracking to our estimates. Mechanical completion of the plant and pad facilities is targeted for August 2013, with first steam in December 2013 and first oil out February 2014.</p>
          <p>Our well-defined plan to take thermal production capacity to 480,000 barrels a day continues to fold on track. At Kirby North Phase 1, the public disclosure document has been submitted, and we expect the regulatory application to be filed by year-end. The DBM engineering kicked off in July, and we target first steam-in for 2016 and Kirby North production to be about 40,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>At Grouse, the public disclosure document has been submitted, with the regulatory application to be submitted in Q1 of 2012. The DBM engineering is expected to be completed by mid-2012, and we target first steam-in Q4 2017 and expect gross production to be 40,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>At Birch Mountain Phase 1, we will submit the public disclosure document by year-end and submit the regulatory application by mid-2012. DBM engineering is scheduled to commence mid-2012. Birch Mountain Phase 1 will target production capacity of 60,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Our thermal heavy oil assets are very strong, as you can see, and will deliver value growth for many decades to come. Canadian Natural's program targets production growth of 5% in 2011. For 2012, production is targeted to be in the 105,000 to 115,000 barrels a day range, up about 10%. And in 2013, we target production to increase 15% to 125,000 to 130,000 barrel a day range. And in 2014, with Kirby coming on stream, we target production over 20% growth to the 150,0000 to 160,000 barrels a day range. Solid production growth from thermal our assets, which are the key drivers of a more sustainable, long-life production profile going forward for Canadian Natural.</p>
          <p>Turning to Horizon. So I'm going to summarize here where we are today on the start-up and general terms, but both Peter and R&#xE9;al are here to provide a bit more detail. As we stated in the last press release, we expect to be mechanically complete and turn over the plant's commissioning during the first week of August. I'm happy to report we are complete, and the turnover to commissioning has begun. We expect about 2 to 3 weeks commission time before we turn over to the full operations mode. And thereafter, it will take us a few days to ramp up to the 110,000 barrels a day design rates. The cost for a rebuild and to repair collateral damage is tracking to our estimate, and we believe the final costs will be roughly $425 million. Canadian Natural carries insurance to cover the costs of these repairs, as well as business interruption insurance after 90 days, covering operating costs up to $30 a barrel. And to give you more detail, I'll turn it over to R&#xE9;al, who will give you a brief summary on what was completed on the rebuild and our expansion projects underway. And Peter will update you on the completion of the collateral damage, our accelerated turnarounds, and importantly, where we are in commissioning today and what commissioning is required to achieve stable operations. R&#xE9;al?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. So, first of all I will talk about the coker rebuild and then will give an update on Phase 2, 3 update. On the coker rebuild, several things happened here since January 6 until now and I will start to explain to you a little bit of the challenge we've been through. First of all, the cold weather. As you know in January, February and March were extremely cool weather in the Fort McMurray area, for ranging several days over minus 30 and beyond. Behind that we had also the heavy rain and the thunder storm in April and July which didn't help and we have several times, we had to evacuate the area, because we had some lightning risk in the area. Combined with this we had also high winds which made us for 16 days not being able to do high lift in the direct area.</p>
          <p>Now to top it all off, from May 15 to June 7, we had a forest fire that was surrounding the plant. <mark type="ph" /> None of this (23:01) created any damage on the plant core per se. However with heavy smoke and the risk from the fire around, we had to evacuate the people there for that period of time, which of course provided no progress on the field work. However at that time, we also focused on expediting the procurement.</p>
          <p>And then, talking about procurement, all the de-coking mechanisms were fabricated in Germany. So, we had to charter three times heavy load plane to deliver the material directly to site. So, you can imagine we had some of those challenges. But despite all this talking about the cost right now, our forecast in February was $190 million for the rebuild component after the coker fire, and I am pleased to say today that we will complete all the jobs under budget.</p>
          <p>On the schedule side, the train 2A and B &#x2013; the cokers are divided in two trains: train 1 and train 2, and each train has two cokers. So, train number 2A and B, the actual turnover was accomplished on July 27 to our operation. We have all the cladding, the bending repair, all that, and all the 16 systems that are included into A and B were repaired and they're functional and they have been turned over to operation control and custody.</p>
          <p>On the train 1 A and B, the last system turnover for startup of operation which is the decoking system, will be turned over tomorrow as scheduled, which will complete a 15 systems turnover to operation out of 17. The two remaining, which are not necessary for operation at this time of year is the cladding and the heat tracing in some area, and the heat ventilations and the air conditioning. So we are in good position right now for starting up the plant.</p>
          <p>Now talking about the Phase 2, 3 update: as you know we have divided the plant update into five major component and I will talk to each one of them to give you an update on them. The one that we call reliability, which includes all preparation plant number three, which is by the way right now over 95% complete and is in the process of being turn over to operation and the official turnover date for that one is September 22.</p>
          <p>The hydro transport, which is also essentially complete and we are in the commissioning mode right now and one major final product tank which has been completed already and is fully operational. All three by the way have been completed within budget, and as a matter of fact right now out of those three we have been able to come up at $47 million under budget. The three remaining one out of the reliability &#x2013; the gas recovery unit, the butane treating unit and the sulfur recovery plan &#x2013; are well underway. The engineering is 96% complete, the procurement 72% complete and the construction's on its way right now. The piling has been completed and we are into foundation right now. Again all those threes are on-schedule and within budget estimate at this time. Under directive 74, we have also made some progress there, we're talking here about tailing works and mature fine-tunings we're handling. These projects also are in progress right now and on schedule. We have our tailing plants that have been approved by the regulators also earlier on here this summer. And we're starting the field work in August.</p>
          <p>On the Phase 2 which was divided in Phase 2A and 2B, Phase 2A included the delayed coker expansion which is right now on the engineering side 50% complete, the procurement is 20% complete. Both of them as planned and the construction is scheduled to start next spring. The upgrading, debottlenecking, and the H2S stripper, the engineering has been started and we've also procured mining equipment, shovels, trucks and auxiliary equipment that are on order and will be delivered in later part of this year and first part of next year. On the Phase 2B we have an Ore Preparation Plant Number 4 and the hydro transport associated with it. We have <mark type="ph" /> full (27:48) treatment train number 2, the gasoil hydrotreater, vacuum distillations and diluent recovery unit, the hydrogen plant and all the associated building and utilities. All of these plans by the way the engineering design specification has been completed. We are out for bid at this time and the majority should be awarded a here before year-end.</p>
          <p>Now the last phase, which is Phase 3 we still also have some of these project underway, the extraction train 3 and number 4, <mark type="ph" /> the pitners (28:21), the cyclone, the <mark type="ph" /> tailing (28:23) transfer and their associated utilities, the engineering and procurement award should be done also in September, October of this year.</p>
          <p>We have also and I'm pleased say this, completed the tie-ins and the early work that was associated with these projects is during the shutdown, so there was great opportunity for us to do this. And all of them were done on or ahead of schedule and under budget. So that gives you a bit of an update of Phase 2, 3 where we are right now, we are well on our way right now to be successful there as well. Peter.</p>

          <p>Thanks R&#xE9;al. I will cover off a little bit of where we are and speak more specifically around the startup preparations. A significant amount of work in the collateral damage repairs, opportune maintenance and turnaround work has all come to a completion. Horizon has completed all of its regulatory pressure equipment inspections that are due prior to 2013 and this of course supports our deferral of the remainder of turnaround scope to 2013.</p>
          <p>All the process equipment and systems have been walked down with operations and maintenance personnel to prepare for commissioning and start-up, and these walkdowns will continue through this weekend. We are currently focused on correcting and finishing final punch-list efficiency items and finishing final loop checks on the instrument and control systems. In preparation for startup there remain a couple of essential requirements that must be met before we complete the commissioning sequence and feed in.</p>
          <p>Firstly, procedures review and operations recertification training to ensure that we have elevated the focus on operating discipline for our facility. Independent field verification of critical startup and emergency procedures are all on target to be 100% complete this weekend. All operation supervisors to complete the supervisory training program by August 10, and the refresher training for operators and their recertification will also be completed by August 10.</p>
          <p>The second significant requirement is adherence to and completion of the pre-startup safety review and checklist. These checklists ensure that we have property incorporated any changes to the operating plant configuration, that we also ensure a proper quality assurance check has been completed of any rebuilt and maintained equipment. That our emergency response plans and safety systems are all good to go ensuring that all field level hazards are removed prior to startup.</p>
          <p>These are things like scaffolding removed or piping systems that still required insulation. And then, finally ensuring that all the supporting business systems are ready to go. And I can assure you as of yesterday when we review to please startup safety reviews, all areas reported no material deficiencies in the checklists that would prevent startup. Some areas will be required to perform their last field level checks as we bring feed in.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to spend a moment just talking a little bit about where we are on status regarding commissioning and the remaining steps to go. As of this morning, water systems are circulating throughout the entire plant. In mining, the shovels and support equipment and staffing are all set to go. In operations and extraction, we are running on water. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:54) treatment is also circulating on water and we would currently <mark type="ph" /> de-blinding the cycle plaques (32:00).</p>
          <p>The diluent recovery unit is being inventoried with distillate and we will go on circulation in the DRU today. We are starting wet gas compressor this morning. The hydrogen unit is expected to be making process gas later today. Looking at tomorrow, we will be filling the froth tanks and essentially this is a milestone marker for us as it represents a startup for the mining and extraction operations activities.</p>
          <p>Then the weekend on through to early next week the delayed coker unit will go onto circulation and the coke cutting of the existing coke drums will begin this weekend. We will take time at this stage to ensure we have adequately removed any residual coke particles from the piping systems and ensure the integrity of the unit. Hydrotreaters, our final aspect of the startup, should complete commissioning activities following this and be ready to go into circulation.</p>
          <p>We are giving ourselves, as you sense, a bit of time to complete the commissioning and startup activities to allow for some final unit integrity checks and to ensure that the product quality requirements will be met. We expect to take two to three weeks before we are in production. Back to you Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter and R&#xE9;al. As you can see we are well on our way to stable operations again at Horizon and I'm very confident that we effectively utilized this period of downtime during the rebuild to complete all opportune maintenance and to increase our levels of operating discipline in the coking units to the same high levels of operating discipline we maintain in our operations across the company.</p>
          <p>As a result, I believe when we do get to 110,000 barrels a day here in two to three weeks we will have a more stable and reliable operations going forward. Consistent with other areas in the company, we have not lost the focus on value creation of future expansions. We continue to progress expansion of Horizon from 110,000 to 250,000 barrels a day. Engineering and procurement has been proceeding allowing Canadian Natural to effectively implement the disciplined execution strategy we have developed for the Horizon expansion. This strategy gives Canadian Natural the ability to high levels of cost synergy while still maintaining capital flexibility providing us the ability to stop or start construction if the market becomes over-heated. As part of the unfolding of the strategy the company has approved $2 billion of capital expenditure in 2012 to regress the expansion of Horizon as part of an overall capital budget for the company of $278 billion expected in 2012.</p>
          <p>This 2012 budget will allow for the progression of some additional E&amp;P work as R&#xE9;al explained as well as some construction kicking off. As we have stated in the previous conference calls we expect about 5000 barrels a day of construction coming from reliability projects, 10,000 barrels a day production from debottlenecking and coke extension projects and 45,000 barrels a day from the addition of the fourth OPP additional froth treatment back in distillation and a gasoil hydrotreater, and 80,000 barrels a day from the addition off fifth OPP, a third and fourth extraction trains and combined hydrotreater and additional sulfur recovery.</p>
          <p>The 2012 capital expenditure will progress activities in all of these areas. Horizon is a world-class asset and we have over 16 billion barrels on our lease with 6 billion barrels recoverable. Our design  capacity is currently 110,000 barrels a day, and our effective strategy to take a staged approach to expand to the first 250,000 barrels a day, and then also only to just under 500,000 barrels a day, or 0.5 million barrels a day of light sweet 34 degree API crude for 40 years with no declines. Its clear Horizon is a world-class asset and will continue to generate significant free cash flow for decades to come. Canadian Natural is in a very strong position with well balanced, diversified assets and we are set to unlock significant value for shareholders going forward.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural can unlock this value and at the same time generate significant free cash flow throughout the future capital programs required to unlock that potential of our vast asset base. Also ensuring we maintain a very strong balance sheet. This allows us to effectively transition the company to a more longer life production mix, provides us the ability to increase dividends on a sustainable basis and if available capture opportunistic acquisitions if they add value.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it over to Doug who will highlight the financial strength of the company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Steve and good morning, I would like to briefly summarize several financial highlights for Canadian Natural in the first half of 2011.  We generated cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion or $2.37 a share on a fully diluted basis with no revenue contribution from Horizon as a result of the suspension of production in early January.</p>
          <p>In the same period, we incurred capital expenditures of $3.1 billion.  This resulted in reported debt outstanding at June 30, of $8.6 billion including the current portion of long-term debt of USD400 million, which was retired in July.</p>
          <p>The $8.6 billion compares to $8.5 billion at the end of 2010 and represents the focus of Canadian Natural to maintaining our balance sheet strength.  The result was the maintenance of our debt-to-book capitalization metric at 29% and debt-to-EBITDA at 1.2 times.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mentioned the repayment in July of the 6.7% USD400 million debt securities represented the retirement of our inaugural U.S. dollar debt offering into the United States debt markets in 2001.</p>
          <p>We also focused our attention on our long-term financial stability and liquid resources.  In June, we negotiated an increase to our $2.2 billion revolving bank credit facilities of $3 billion and extended the facility to 2015.</p>
          <p>Today, our aggregate bank credit facilities are approximately $4.7 billion of which $2.8 billion were undrawn at June 30, providing us with adequate liquid resources and flexibility as we navigate through the current economic stress events impacting North America and European economies.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we made good progress on our insurance claim for the Horizon fire incident.  Our team and the insurers worked together to review the claim and in the second quarter we received the first interim payment under the business interruption portion of the policy following the period of self insurance.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, we recognized $136,000 million partially offsetting our fixed operating cost obligations.  Additional business interruption recoveries related to the second and third quarters will be recognized as payments are processed and the terms of the insurance settlement are determined.</p>
          <p>Our commodity hedging program continues to be actively managed.  No new positions were added in the second quarter.  However it is our intention to actively pursue this as a means of underpinning our cash flow from operations in order to insure the completion of our future capital spending plans while also ensuring the fulfillment of our other commitments including our dividend policy and the management of our balance sheet strength.</p>
          <p>Details of the hedged positions are available in note 15 of the financial statements and are also available on our website.  In conclusion I believe we are very well positioned financially to continue to develop our diverse asset base including the improved strategic expansion capital expenditures for Horizon, utilizing our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the strength of our balance sheet, and providing adequate liquid resources to ensure the completion of our plans.  This financial strength complements our management strategies, and the company's disciplined approach to project execution.</p>
          <p>Thank you.  And I will return you to John for some closing comments.</p>

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I'm curious to get your latest thoughts with regard to price realizations in your crude oil marketing strategy. Near term you're clearly restarting Horizon here as well as ramping up heavy oil production into a market that's already well supplied, and lacking sufficient takeaway capacity to the Gulf Coast. Longer term, you've highlighted your committed volumes on Keystone XL as opening up a new market for you.  So my questions are first do you foresee any stress on the market near term as you're ramping back up? And second, are there any other medium- to longer-term options outside of Keystone that you'd consider for managing your exposure to the WCS and WTI differentials? Has your willingness to consider refining investments for instance changed at all, or is that out of the picture? Would be great to get any higher level thoughts from you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Joe, Steve Laut here.  And it's a great question, so I'll talk about first bringing on Horizon. As, you know, right now synthetic crude oil's getting about a $14 premium to WTI.  And when we bring Horizon on I would expect that premium to shrink and we normally get about $1 discounts, but when we bring on &#x2013; part of that premium's probably because Horizon's off. So we come on I would expect that to shrink a bit, but we still don't have any issues moving Horizon oil and getting good price for it.</p>
          <p>As far as heavy oil and the other oil in our portfolio and as you pointed out the differentials on Canadian heavy crude or WCS is quite a bit wider than Mayan crude, and that's a lot to do with the logistics at Cushing. We are a strong supporter as you pointed out of Keystone. We believe that Keystone ultimately will be approved probably by the end of the year; however if it's not approved probably you will see a greater push from Canadian producers to get a pipeline built off the west coast and that will access Asian markets.</p>
          <p>As far as does it cause us to rethink our refining investment, as you probably realize, we are a 50% owner in the construction of the Redwater upgrader that will be constructed in Edmonton. And we are progressing engineering right now and we expect to sanction that project near the end of this year or early next year 2012, that will process about 70,000 barrels a day of heavy oil blend, which will give us additional upgrading capacity or market for heavy oil. Again we do believe Keystone will be built and we're a large, strong supporter of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then just to clarify, in the absence of Keystone, would any medium term options be on the table for you in terms of additional upgrading or downstream capacity, or is it really Redwater and that's basically the extent of what we should be thinking about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from George Toriola of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning guys. A couple of questions, first on Horizon expansion, could you just provide some clarity as to what capital you've invested to date on the expansion side of things and what you estimate the total CapEx would be and this is probably taking you to 250,000 barrels a day, are you able to provide that clarity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, George I can give you some clarity and as you probably heard us talk, we're not too keen on giving the full discount on what we think the costs will be going forward because we are going to do this on a step-wise project by project basis and we'll disclose our capital budget as we go.</p>
          <p>So right now on reliability and Directive 74 work and some Phase 2A work that we've done, we spent about &#x2013; by the end of the year we will have spent about $1.4 billion. Going forward I think you can say that we're not going to do any expansions, we said that very clearly unless we know we can get a return on capital, and that it's economic, and just give you a trademark sort of marker, we believe that you need to be $100,000 per flowing barrel or less to be economic in about an $80 world. So you can say that we're targeting to be less than that as we go forward but again depending on what the market is we will proceed in an orderly fashion to engineer and construct but mostly on the construction if we see an overheating in the market or a shortage of labor we will take a time-out and stop construction so we can control cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. I guess that then feeds into my second question here, which has to with your total capital spend, for next year you're guiding to $7 billion to $8 billion. I guess if we look out depending on what commodity prices do here, but if we look out the next ten and years beyond that, that type of capital spend would see you with significant free cash flow, so what would be your thoughts around that free cash flow in that environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you're correct, we have the ability here to generate free cash flow throughout the whole Horizon construction and our significant thermal expansion plants as well as maintain our business and grow the other parts of the business. So, our priorities for free cash flow, obviously we are focused on increasing dividends, but they have to be sustainable. We're also &#x2013; we'll take advantage of any opportunistic acquisition opportunities we see out there. And you can see we did about $2 billion worth of property acquisitions in 2010. We're tracking to about just under $1 billion this year, the deal flow has slowed up, so we'll see what that is in 2012, but if there is opportunities and we can see we can add value we'll take advantage of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just two more quick questions, when you say opportunistic acquisitions, that suggests that natural gas type acquisitions, would that be the way you look at it as to that would be where opportunity would be regardless of the fact that you are bearish on natural gas here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's what's happened here likely in the past, we are probably about 70% gas this year, but it's all about where we can add value. So mostly we do it in our core areas and we do it where we have an advantage, where we can lower costs and see reserves value, so you have seen us in actually 2010, we bought additional properties around Kirby, which is heavy oil, and again in this year we bought significant chunks of undeveloped land in our primary heavy oil area, which is very opportunistic. We can leverage our infrastructure to do that. So, it just turns out that it's been more gas weighted but it's all opportunistic where we can add value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And final question, this is on Pelican, when you talk about the southern portion of the field and the response taking longer than anticipated, can you &#x2013; does this have to do with injectivity, what exactly do you think is driving this lower than expected response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well George I thank you for the question because obviously there's been a lot of attention paid to this. We don't have any issues with injectivity, we're getting the polymer away, no problem and at reasonable pressure, and what we're seeing here is, in the southern portion of the pool, the rock is somewhat different than the northern portion, the water saturations in the rock are little bit higher, and in some places we have a little bit of a gas cap.</p>
          <p>So it looks like what we're doing is, we're getting &#x2013; for some reason we're getting a better sweep conformance. So the flood front, or the polymer front, is more uniform, and we're sweeping a more consistent bank of oil towards the producers. So we know from pressure responses and we know that we're putting a barrel in, we're going to get a barrel out. So it looks like we could be heading for very, very good recoveries here in the south.  The unfortunate part about it is because we're getting such good sweep, that sort of flood bank of oil in front of the polymer front is taking longer to get to producing wells.  So that's in a very simplistic term what's really going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you don't see any risk to reserve bookings or things like that based on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks, quick question on Pelican Lake as well. I was wondering if you can provide any color into the regulatory concerns about the cap rock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The concerns here are Alex is that one of the offsetting operators in the pool was drilling a well into the polymer flood and experienced higher pressure, which the regulators believe and not the operators and not us in the rock above the zone. So their concern is that there's a potential for break-through into the cap rock, and that those pressures, they need to have conformance. So what they want and what they need of course is to show us and demonstrate that the cap rock has the integrity to withhold the pressure that we flood with at polymer. And polymer floods were flooding at a higher pressure than you do under normal water , and so there is some concern because it's a new process. Obviously the regulators are very familiar with water flooding.  Polymer flooding is a little bit higher pressure so there's concern, they're being more cautious. And all that data is being collected now, cap rock data and from all our studies we see I don't think it will be a concern, but we just need to prove it, and that's what's happening. So I expect all the data will be there by September, all the analysis I'm working to get to the regulator will be completed shortly after. That will impact probably our drilling plans in 2012 if it impacts us at all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that is on our list of priorities, but our first priority would probably either dividend increase or acquisitions, and obviously we do share buybacks especially something we should probably looking at as the share price drops off here in this market. But we believe that we have a huge asset inventory and that we can add value by increasing our &#x2013; by allocating our capital to our assets and progressing it. There's lots of areas we can add value through technology development as well.</p>

          <p>It is not &#x2013; it's probably a third to half of what it was in 2010. And I'd say throughout the course of the year here it's been drying up, so I think the deal flow continues to dwindle, so not sure how big it will be in 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I have yet another follow-up question on that $7 billion to $8 billion CapEx estimate. It looks to be down from roughly $9 billion as per your May Investor Day presentation, so I'm just wondering if there's any color that you can provide in this regard. And then second is there anything that is not included in that $7 billion to $8 billion estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No there is nothing not &#x2013; that includes all plans to fully develop our thermal plants, so executing all our plans, all the strat wells for future, our light oil plans, primary heavy oil, international and of course Horizon and gas. So the $9.5 billion actually was kind of a round up, it was closer to $8.5 billion to $9 billion. And so really that was sort of the outside estimate at that time, we wanted to make sure we had the biggest number we could put in there. So nothing's really changed. We're just being very conservative in the open house.</p>
