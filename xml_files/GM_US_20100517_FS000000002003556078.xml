          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Motors Q1 2010 Results. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only-mode, and afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Monday May 17, 2010.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Director of Investor Relations and Communications at GM. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us as we review our 2010 first quarter results. As you know, our press release was issued and our Form 10-Q was filed with the SEC earlier today. The conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. As always, the contents of our call will be governed by this language. We would also like to highlight that GM is broadcasting this call live via the Internet and that the financial media is participating as well.</p>
          <p>This afternoon, Chris Liddell, GM Vice Chairman and CFO, will review our first quarter results. The presentation portion of the call will be followed by a Q&amp;A session for both analysts and then the media. I would also like to mention we have several other executives available to assist in answering your questions. With us today are Nick Cyprus, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; Dan Ammann, Vice President and Treasurer; and Chuck Stevens, CFO, North America.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Chris Liddell.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy, and good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to start the call by discussing some principles on how we intend to approach these calls. We've standardized and simplified the information that we'll give you each quarter as you see on the slides, and we believe this will make it easier for you to follow key trends in the business. We're only going to provide and discuss what we believe is the most relevant information for stockholders. We will present the same format and the same information in future quarters and the same basic approach, whether it's good news or not.</p>
          <p>Our main focus will be on GAAP-based numbers. Where we provide non-GAAP numbers, we'll show reconciliation to the GAAP numbers, and then the appendix will include backup charts that will provide more detailed information in support of some of the main charts.</p>
          <p>I also want to mention that we will only be showing adjustments to EBIT for significant items that do not frequently reoccur. For example, we will not be adjusting EBIT for restructuring charges from this point forward as we believe restructuring tends to be an ongoing part of this industry as opposed to truly non-recurring. We will also supplement the final information with key performance indicators but only where those provide insight.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd also like you to focus your questions on the major trends in the business, as I mentioned in the last call I think on fresh-start accounting. If you can direct your more detailed questions, for example to enable you to populate your financial models, to the Investor Relations team after the call.</p>
          <p>Having said all of the above, we're keen to ensure you get all the information that you believe is critical, and therefore we are happy to receive any feedback on possible improvements to our approach. Please give us those after the call. So with that, let's get started on the results.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 2, it's a summary of our financial results. And as you can see, we are showing results for the period commencing July 10, the date the new General Motors Company was launched, through September 30, the fourth quarter of last year 2009, and the first quarter of this year 2010. Today, we will focus our discussion on the first quarter results and how that compare to the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Because of fresh-start accounting and the fact we're a significantly different company from a year ago, I don't believe it makes sense to compare financial results to the first quarter of 2009. We will give year-over-year market share and other data, and once we've left the bankruptcy and the introduction of fresh-start accounting, we'll also give you commentary on year-over-year GAAP financial changes, but not for this call.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter of 2010, we've recorded net revenue of $31.5 billion as you can see, down slightly from fourth quarter levels. Despite this lower revenue, operating income was $1.2 billion, up approximately 5 billion from the fourth quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $0.9 billion, and earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were $1.66 per share.</p>
          <p>We also want to highlight some non-GAAP measures that we believe are important. EBIT adjusted was $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 2.7 from the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow was positive 1 billion for the first quarter, and is defined as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion less capital expenditures of approximately $700 million. And just to be clear, those are the same definitions we'll use constantly from now on in each quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, it was an extremely good first quarter for General Motors; posting a profit and generating positive cash flows are important steps as we work to rebuild General Motors.</p>
          <p>Slide 3 provides a walk from operating income to EBIT adjusted. As previously mentioned, operating income was $1.2 billion for the first quarter. We had equity income of $400 million, which is our proportionate share of income earned by equity method investees, primarily our joint ventures in China. We also deducted 100 million related to the non-GM owned proportionate share of the positive results of consolidated entities, primarily GM Daewoo. And we had non-operating income of $300 million, largely related to derivative gains and the gain related to the sale of Saab.</p>
          <p>That gets us to a total EBIT of $1.8 billion. And adjusting for, or backing out, the $123 million gain related to the sale of Saab, we have an EBIT adjusted of $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 4 shows first quarter earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, by region. And as you can see, GM North America and GM International Operations both contributed EBIT of approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, GM Europe had a loss of $506 million and we had expense of $82 million at the corporate level. I'll give you more detail by region on the following slides.</p>
          <p>Also as previously mentioned, in the fourth quarter we had an adjustment related to the gain on the sale of Saab of $123 million. So in total we recorded EBIT adjusted of $1.7 billion, same number from the previous slide.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, we provide an overview of GM's global vehicle deliveries as well as market share. These figures include vehicles sold around the world under GM and JV brand and through GM branded distribution networks. For the first quarter of 2010, our global deliveries were approximately 2 million units, an increase of 46,000 units over the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was largely driven by increased deliveries in China where the market continued to be very strong in the first quarter. Our global market share actually dropped slightly in the first quarter largely because of the discontinued brands in North America.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 6, first quarter deliveries in GM North America were 563,000 units, down approximately 74,000 units versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The reduction was driven by a 1.5 point decline in GM market share from 19.3% to 17.8%, as well as a slight reduction in the North American industry. As you can see on the chart, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, our four brand deliveries declined 36,000 units, and the discontinued brands declined 38,000 units.</p>
          <p>Market share in the U.S. fell from 20.2% in the fourth quarter to 18.4% in the first quarter of 2010. Of the 1.8 point decline, 1.3 points were related to discontinued brands and 0.5 points related to our remaining brand performance.</p>
          <p>The decline in the remaining brand performance was influenced by competitor incentives in March, which we did not follow, as evidenced by our retail incentives being less in that month than the industry average. Limited availability of products like the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and Cadillac SRX also had an impact on our U.S. share performance in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 shows what we believe are our important underlying indicators' performance in GM North America. The top line shows total U.S. market share for GM; the slightly lower line is for combined U.S. market share for our four brands, Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac. And the bars are GM's average U.S. retail incentives for the four brands based on JDP &#x2013; J.D. Power PIN data. We have also noted, at the bottom of the chart, our average U.S. retail incentives for the four brands as a percent of industry average.</p>
          <p>Although there is considerable movement on a month-by-month basis, the trend lines show important progress in the company. We've been able to improve share of our core brands while stabilizing total share, and at the same time reducing our incentive levels, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of industry averages.</p>
          <p>Over the last year, for example, we've increased the quarterly share for Cadillac, Chevy, GMC and Buick from 15.4 to 18.1%, and our average incentives have been reduced 40% from approximately $5,000 per unit to $3,000 per unit. We've also shown the most recent data, April 2010, on the chart. In April, our remaining brands captured 18.3% of the market, and our average U.S. retail incentives were at 108% of the industry average.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 8, GMNA, GM North America net revenue was 19.3 billion for the quarter, a $1 billion increase from the fourth quarter of 2009. The revenue increase is primarily attributable to increased production of 52,000 units to support build-up in U.S. dealer inventory in preparation of the spring selling season, and an anticipated improvement in the overall industry. As you can see, our U.S. dealer inventory increased 43,000 units to 428,000 units, a level we're comfortable with going into the spring selling season. This represents 66 days' supply, down from 152 days a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9, GM North America earnings before interest and tax were $1.2 billion for the quarter, a 4.6 billion improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The significant improvement was primarily attributable to the impact of increased production volume, which contributed approximately 600 million; reduced SG&amp;A expense of approximately 400 million; lower pension and healthcare expense of around 300 million, primarily related to the UAW VEBA settlement; lower restructuring charges of approximately $400 million; improved material and freight of about 100 million; and the absence of the 2.6 billion UAW VEBA settlement adjustment, as well as other adjustments that occurred in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that SG&amp;A expenses' savings were largely related to marketing support, which is traditionally higher in the fourth quarter, and would expect it to be higher in the latter part of this year as well.</p>
          <p>Another way to think about the financial performance at GM North America is that without the benefit of building 65,000 units of inventory across all of North America, we've delivered EBIT of approximately $700 million. Overall, much improved performance, therefore, in GM North America. We've lowered the breakeven in North America overall to approximately 11 million U.S. industry units through a combination of both cost and revenue actions.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, we've introduced strong products resulting in higher transaction prices, and reduced incentive spending across the portfolio. On the cost side, we have improved manufacturing capability utilization, rightsized the hourly and salaried workforce, and reduced legacy healthcare expenses.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 10, GM Europe deliveries for the first quarter, which include two months of Saab sales, were 405,000 units, up 27,000 units from fourth quarter levels. The increase was the result of a stronger market and higher share in the U.K. and The Netherlands, partially offset by a weaker market and lower share in Germany. GM Europe market share increased 0.3 points to 8.5%, with share in Germany down 0.6 points to 8.2%, and share in the U.K. up 0.6 points to 11.8%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, GM Europe revenue was $5.5 billion for the first quarter, down 800 million versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The reduction in revenue was primarily attributable to $300 million of Q4 Saab revenue not in Q1, unfavorable foreign exchange translation of around $300 million, and a reduction in wholesale shipments. Wholesale units decreased despite a 90,000 unit increase in GM production because non-consolidated JVs accounted for approximately half of the increase and GM inventory has increased from very low 2009 year-end levels.</p>
          <p>As seen on slide 12, GM Europe earnings before interest and taxes was a loss of $500 million for the quarter, an improvement of 300 million versus the fourth quarter. Included in the loss of $500 million are restructuring charges of $300 million and a one-time gain related to the Saab spin-off of approximately $100 million.</p>
          <p>GM Europe's improved performance in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter was mainly driven by $200 million of favorable mix, largely related to the introduction of the new Astra; improved material cost performance of around $100 million; and the non-reoccurrence of Q4 Saab losses of about $200 million.</p>
          <p>Having said that, despite this progress we are still losing money in Europe. Our focus there remains to build a sustainable and profitable business. Our plans include the separation of over 8,000 people and a reduction in capacity of 20%. These separation programs have already commenced, and we continue to seek final agreement on employee savings of over $300 million annually.</p>
          <p>Before we review GM International Operations' first quarter results, I'd like to briefly discuss the treatment of joint ventures and the impact of our various metrics. Our largest joint ventures in the GMIO region include GM Daewoo, in which we have a 70% stake; Shanghai GM, SGM, in which we have a 49% stake; SAIC-GM-Wuling, in which we have a 34% stake; and FAW-GM, in which we have a 50% stake.</p>
          <p>Given our 70% stake in GM DAT, GM International Operations includes all of their revenues as well as 100% of their EBIT, less non-controlling interest net of tax. For our SGM, SGMW and FAW-GM joint ventures, in which we have a 50% stake or less, we report deliveries and include in GM International Operations their market share of all vehicles. However, GAAP consolidated revenue and costs do not include these JVs, but our pro rata share of net income of these JVs is realized through equity income included in earnings before interest and tax.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of detail there, and we'll clearly continue to give you as much transparency as possible so you can reconcile all of these numbers on the various charts.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13, GM International Operations' deliveries were just over 1 million for the quarter, up 93,000 units versus the fourth quarter. The vast majority of the increase in deliveries was related to increases in China, driven by 15% increase in industry sales, and a 17% or an 89,000 unit increase in our deliveries in China. Our share in China increased to 13.5%, up 13.3% (sic) [up from 13.3%] in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, our market share in Brazil increased 1.2 points to 19.9%, and share in India increased from 3.7% in the fourth quarter to 4.2% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Not highlighted in the slide is the very strong growth in emerging markets on a year-over-year basis. In China, for example, both the industry and our deliveries were up by more than 70% from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of this year. And in Brazil, the industry was up 18% and our deliveries were up 27%.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 14, GM International Operations' net revenue was 8.1 billion for the quarter, down 1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2009. This decrease was driven by foreign currency impacts of around $400 million and volume related reductions of approximately $600 million. The volume related reductions were primarily in Brazil and at GM DAT.</p>
          <p>We experienced quarter-to-quarter revenue declines in Brazil largely due to higher wholesales in the fourth quarter as GM Brazil rebuilt dealer stocks from unusually low levels. In addition, there are a higher number of rental car units in transit at the end of the first quarter whose revenue will be not recognized until final delivery.</p>
          <p>With regards to GM DAT, the decline was due to lower exports and domestic sales. Export sales were helped in the fourth quarter by a large fleet order, and domestic sales were helped by government incentives.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 15, GMIO earnings before interest and taxes were $1.2 billion, up $0.5 billion versus the fourth quarter. Equity income, primarily related to the SGM and SGMW joint ventures, reached $400 million, and contributed $100 million to the improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2009. Also contributing to the improvement were a $100 million reduction in SG&amp;A due to lower marketing costs, a $100 million increase in royalties, $100 million reduction in non-controlling interest due to lower GM DAT earnings, and $100 million attributable to derivative mark-to-market adjustments.</p>
          <p>While the International Operations first quarter results were encouraging, there is some potential for headwinds throughout the remainder of the year due to a reduction or expiration in various government incentives, the vehicle purchases in key markets such as China and Brazil starting in the second quarter, as well as potential tightening of general credit conditions in markets such as China, Brazil and Australia.</p>
          <p>So turning to cash flows, as you can see in slide 16, GAAP net cash flows from operating activities were $1.7 billion for the first quarter of 2010. And after adjusting for capital expenditures of around $700 million, free cash flow was $1.0 billion. The 3.9 billion improvement in free cash flow was largely driven by $4.4 billion improvement in net income and a $1.4 billion improvement in working capital, partially offset by $1.8 billion reduction in pension and OPEB and other items.</p>
          <p>Managed working capital improved from negative $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter to negative 700 million in the first quarter. This was primarily due to increase first quarter production, partially offset by an increase in inventories to more normal levels when compared to seasonally low fourth quarter balances. Additionally, it's important to note that we experienced most of the one-time impact related to the change in supplier payment terms to weekly in the fourth quarter of 2009, although there was some impact in the first quarter as well.</p>
          <p>This negative 600 million of pension and OPEB and other included in the first quarter is primarily related to pension and OPEB cash payments exceeding expense. We contributed approximately $200 million to pension plans during the quarter, and pension expense was approximately zero based on our December 31, 2009 plan measurements.</p>
          <p>The remaining balance is mostly attributable to OPEB cash payments exceeding expense of $100 million, which sets the run rate of OPEB related cash payments to reduce going forward due to the run out of pre December 31, 2009 UAW healthcare claims. However, the Canadian healthcare trust will require approximately $1 billion in funding once all of the conditions for implementation have been met.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to mention that cash restructuring costs totaled approximately $300 million for the quarter, and were primarily related to people costs and dealer wind-down payments.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 17, we've provided a summary of depreciation and amortization by region as well as capital expenditures. Total depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $1.8 billion, down 450 million from the fourth quarter. D&amp;A in North America was approximately $1.2 billion; GM Europe, 384 million; GM International, 194 million; and $51 million at corporate level.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $755 million, down around 300 million from the fourth quarter. It would be fair to say that capital expenditures will accelerate as we progress through the year, and we estimate that total CapEx of approximately $6 billion is anticipated for the entire 2010 calendar year.</p>
          <p>As seen on slide 18, GM's liquidity position remains strong, as we ended the first quarter with $35.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.</p>
          <p>Total debt had a face value of 15.5 billion, or 14.2 billion book value in the first quarter of 2010. The 1.6 billion decrease in book value versus the fourth quarter is primarily related to $1.2 billion debt payments to the UST and the EDC, and repayment of debt related to the Supplier Support Program. As you know, we paid down the outstanding U.S. Treasury and EDC debt totaling $5.8 billion in April, and remaining UST escrow balance of the $6.6 billion became unrestricted as a result of that.</p>
          <p>Preferred stock issued to the UAW VEBA trust and the United States and Canadian government remained unchanged at 7 billion book value, or 9 billion face value.</p>
          <p>Global underfunded pensions were 26.9 billion at the end of the first quarter. No significant remeasurements were performed during the quarter. The $600 million reduction versus Q4 2009 is mostly attributable to plan contributions of $200 million as well as the translational impact of foreign currency exchange.</p>
          <p>OPEB obligations were valued at $9.4 billion in the first quarter. The $200 million reduction versus Q4 2009 is mostly attributable to the payment of UAW medical claims incurred in 2009.</p>
          <p>So just a couple of comments before I summarize. There are a lot of numbers, obviously, I have gone through in the last 20 minutes or so, but just want to reinforce the message that I gave at the start at the call. This is going to be a very standard format that we're going to follow. Hopefully, you'll get into the cadence of that as time goes on and you'll see the numbers presented in a very similar approach. The only reason we'll make any changes is based on feedback from you. So gone through a lot of numbers, but it's fitting really the platform for communications with you going forward, and hopefully you become more familiar with them as time goes on.</p>
          <p>But just to summarize, before I take questions, if I close on slide 19. Stepping back from all the numbers, what should you take out of the quarter?</p>
          <p>I guess, first and foremost, it's encouraging that we delivered profitability and positive cash flow. In North America, our four brand share was up and our incentives were down versus a year ago, and we've lowered our breakeven significantly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We are well positioned to grow profitably in our International Operations but we have more work to do in Europe.</p>
          <p>But most importantly of all, I believe we continue to make great progress in our vision of designing, building and selling the world's best vehicles, and achieving profitability is a nice reflection of that.</p>
          <p>So with those prepared remarks, I am happy to take a few questions. And I'll hand it back to Randy to organize that, and my colleagues may help me depending on the level of detail.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey; good morning. Question on the product strategy in the U.S., North America, and how it shows up in the financials we've looked at. Where are you on contribution per vehicle, which I know you're probably not breaking out anymore, but at least directionally, versus, say, some of the assumptions back in the Evercore plan? And to what extent is that the general pricing level in North America that's approved, rental cars perhaps coming back with program cars being profitable; the mix you're seeing or within the general &#x2013; within the mix you're seeing, getting consumers to take more upscale profitable options within a model line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Okay. There's a lot of ground in that. I will sort of cover it a high level and Chuck might add some comment. I mean, overall in North America, the most encouraging thing is, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that we are seeing the market share of our core brands, it's the 4 remaining brands, going up at the same time as incentive levels are going down, and average transaction prices are going up as well; I mentioned that.</p>
          <p>So the overall brand strategy of focusing on a fewer number of nameplates, focusing on higher value where we can, and lowering the incentive structure, at least at this early part of the year, looks like it's paying off very well. And we are obviously going into a period now where we are launching some new models as well. So we're looking forward to the contribution from models like the Cruze and the Regal. So we'd say the overall brand strategy is looking good; rental sales are included in the numbers. So again, from a profitability point of view, we are able to achieve the profitability that we talked about with the mix that we had across the level.</p>
          <p>And last but not least is we are able to achieve breakeven or better at industry levels in the U.S. of, let's say, approximately 11 million units or even slightly less. So a combination of slightly better mix, slightly better transaction prices, lower incentives and lower costs means that the profitability picture is dramatically different from where it was a year ago, and even better slightly than in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>I don't know, Chuck, whether you want to add anything in particular to that.</p>

          <p>Yes, I would say on a couple of fronts -- I mean, the core brand strategy and aligning supply and demand has not only helped our overall level of transaction price and reduced incentives, but it has also significantly improved our fleet profitability over the last 24 months to the point now where daily rental and other rental fleet businesses is a reasonably profitable venture for us. Versus the fourth quarter, the most recent period, the trend continued into Q1 with both improved transaction prices.</p>
          <p>And Chris had noted our reduced incentives versus the fourth quarter of last &#x2013; or first quarter of last year. We also reduced incentives versus the first quarter. So generally doing better than the Evercore from a margin perspective as well as a average transaction price perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Europe. Adjusting for the charge that you took and the inventory build, the losses are still annualizing at a pretty high rate. Can you define for us more broadly what the total structural cost decline you're shooting for would be, including the 300 million from labor? What kind of volume assumptions do you make to get to this breakeven target? And are those savings at this point defined and agreed to with labor constituencies? And then related to that, just more broadly, any color on your outlook for Europe, any additional concerns, macro concerns or credit availability at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Again, quite a lot of components to your question, but I try and answer most of them in turn. As you say, the first step in the restructuring process is to look at achieving at least breakeven levels, which is what we're looking to do next year, and the restructuring plan envisages that. It's not relying on a large volume increase. I believe there is an implicit volume increase, but to a large extent, that's in cost reductions and slightly better mix with the models that we have coming through.</p>
          <p>So I think there is a reasonable chance that we believe of being breakeven or thereabouts next fiscal year, but there is still clearly a lot of work to be done and still a lot of negotiations going on in Europe. You will have seen some announcements with respect to, say, Antwerp over the last few weeks. So we are certainly making progress, but we haven't yet achieved everything that we need there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the overall market, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, Europe is still probably the most difficult &#x2013; it varies to some extent by country. But if you look at the market overall, it's flat to single digits up versus last year, and that compares to, say, mid-double digits for most of North America, or in other areas in the world like Brazil and China are up 20, 30 and over 70%, respectively. So the overall marketplace in Europe is still the most challenging. And clearly with some of things that are going on, in Greece for example, we're not out of the woods yet.</p>
          <p>So I think there's a chance of being breakeven next year, but there is still a lot of hard work to be done in Europe, and still some challenges in the marketplace to achieve that as well. So we'll continue to update you on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but of all the areas around the world, that's still the most challenging.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; sorry about that. Just looking at your slide 15 on International Operations, it looks like most of the growth actually came &#x2013; most of the sequential improvement in profit was from the non-JV income. What was that doubling in income, the 400 million to 800 million? Was that mainly Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was reasonably broadly based. I think, also in the fourth quarter, there might have been some GM DAT derivative losses or there might have been some non-operating income areas in that. But it was reasonably broadly based &#x2013; certainly good results in Brazil, good results in Australia, GM DAT actually improved itself. So I don't think there was any particular region that I'd point to. It was reasonably good quarter-over-quarter. If there is anything unusual in there, I don't know if my colleagues want to point anything out there, but otherwise I think of the numbers that I've seen on a regional basis it was generally speaking good overall improvement across the board.</p>
          <p>And again, I come back to the comment I made before. The world's an interesting place at the moment, in terms of the way in which the recovery is happening is quite different depending on the part of the world that you're in. And International Operations cover a multiplicity of different countries, but starting in China and working your way through Brazil, India and Australia, generally speaking, now stronger than North America and Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I wanted to just clarify one comment you made. I think you said on the North American profit walk, there was about a $600 million profit improvement sequentially from production. On the 50,000 production increase, I think that would imply a pretty hefty $12,000 contribution margin. Is that &#x2013; that seems high by historical standards. Can you just comment on that number? Is that something we should think about sustainably, or is there something sort of out of whack on that number this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; Chuck will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In Q1, our overall contribution margin was stronger than Q4 and what we'd anticipate for the rest of the year for a couple of reasons. One, we had a really strong mix of truck production Q1. Second, our sales incentives had some unusual stock adjustments associated with the timing of some programs that terminated in early January. So I would say, generally going back to Chris's comments earlier, that excluding the production inventory build, thinking about GM North America earnings in the range of $700 million, I think that would give you a more reasonable view of the contribution margin per unit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, over China. That will just give you a sense of what we see as the sort of maintainable earnings, excluding some of the inventory and other build as well. So, hopefully, it's not only the reported earnings but the underlying ones which are important from a modeling perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; thanks. Hi, Chris. One question on Financial Services. Do you feel that you are at any material disadvantage competitively by not having a captive finance sub fully under your control right now? And if you do, how can you quantify or qualify that disadvantage to us, if there is any? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think not so much necessarily having a captive or not, but I think given obviously all the issues associated with the financial crisis over the last couple of years, I believe we've been somewhat disadvantaged from a sales point of view. I think that's freeing up quite a lot with GMAC's operations coming back to normal.</p>
          <p>We probably are still relatively disadvantaged, in particular in some segments such as subprime, relative to say the captives, but I don't think that necessarily means that we need to own a captive. I know there's been a lot of speculation on that. It's critical from our point of view that there is a free and liquid market for financing in the auto industry. I think that's been a characteristic for 100 years and likely to continue to be so, both at the dealer level and at the customer level.</p>
          <p>So it's important, in terms of our relationship with GMAC and with other providers, that we have a free flow of funding available to all credit limits. That's probably cost us some sales over the last year. I'm not sure whether I'd want to put a number on it, or how I'd quantify it. And we're working hard with GMAC and with some other providers, for that matter, to try and make sure that those issues go away.</p>
          <p>It's probably cost us some sales, but I am not going to say that's been a significant issue over the last year. It's been an issue, and it's one that we're addressing. But again, I just want to reinforce, for a lot of the speculation that's been on, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to be going back into the captive financing market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On North American profitability, obviously it was impressive in the first quarter. I was just wondering about two other levers potentially make that better. First, just on labor, the MOU, the binding arbitration MOU that you signed last year with the UAW, includes sort of a clause that says that next year that arbitration will allow you to get to a competitive cost structure per hour relative to all your competitors, including transplants. So I was just wondering if there is the possibility to step down labor costs next year, maybe the tier-two wage structure that you put in place in '07?</p>
          <p>And also, when we look at the inventory levels, they're being kept very lean, and you seem to be taking pricing. I was just wondering if there's the opportunity to potentially lower incentives further and potentially essentially take more price? So just on the cost side and the revenue side, if there is more opportunity in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There's clearly more opportunity, in particular, I'd say more on the revenue side than the cost side. And I'd like to think that, with the market being in the 11 to 12 million SAAR range in the U.S., that that's still not a trend line. So the biggest single opportunity we have is the market improving and us improving with the market, and hopefully starting to take some market share with our core brands. So that's opportunity number one.</p>
          <p>Second opportunity, which comes in line with your question, is overall pricing and incentive levels. I think there is plenty of focus on that area, and that continues to be an area where I think we can make some progress.</p>
          <p>On the labor side, I'd say there's less there. There may be some small opportunities. But in the overall scheme of where's the big profit upside to North America, it's much more on the market side than it is, certainly in the next year, on the cost side, in particular, labor on the cost side.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Well, a couple of quick questions. Before the bankruptcy, the plan presented for a reorganization of GM assumed that General Motors would be able to make a profit in the U.S. at a 10 million unit-per-year year and with 18% market share. I wonder, now looking back, now that we've gone through a few quarters of the new GM, whether those assumptions have changed somewhat, what kind of adjustments you would make to that? And the most obvious question is, are we going to see these kinds of results through the rest of the year? Will you make, will you show, do you expect to show a profit for all of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I won't go back necessarily compare it to the year-ago model, although I think it was around the mid-10s and 18% market share. And interestingly, that was probably about what we saw in the first quarter; we saw a 10.5 to 11 million SAAR unit and market share in the sort of 18.5% range, and we made $700 million on an underlying basis and sort of 1.2 on a fully-accounted basis.</p>
          <p>So you'd have to say it was consistent with it, not slightly better than what the model might have said a year ago. And I think that's probably we've outperformed on the incentive side, if I thought there was one change to where people might have expected a year ago. So market share possibly in line with the market, in line with those sort of numbers. But we're managing to achieve that on a lower incentive and higher transaction price.</p>
          <p>So I would say it's consistent with, if not slightly better than, the model you're referring to, although to be honest I haven't done a comparison quarter-by-quarter against it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; I think the second half of your question was &#x2013; can we see this on a sustainable basis? I'll make the same health warning that I always make. This is a cyclical and seasonal business. So there are things that will move up and down; our average incentive programs will move; mix will move; marketing expense will move. But there's no reason to say that we shouldn't be pushing for profitability in North America on a consistent and sustained basis. That's clearly our objective, and the first quarter heartens me that we're on the right track.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What can you say about where things stand on IPO planning? There were some reports over the weekend about Treasury starting to look at some firms to advise them on an IPO. Are you on track to do something by the end of this year? Or do you think it's going to take more than a year of these kinds of results to bring an IPO to market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris. I'm in the unusual position of probably just trying to keep people's expectations low on this topic, and keep them focused on just making money and selling cars. The IPO is &#x2013; it will happen when the markets are ready and when the company is ready. And I know that's a sort of a general statement that doesn't help you a lot, but it really is the reality of the situation.</p>
          <p>Could it happen by the end of this year? That's a possibility. Could it be next year? That's a possibility as well. Really, there are a lot of variables at play, not the least of which is the state of the equity markets is incredibly volatile. So making a profit in the first quarter clearly means that we are better off than we would have been otherwise, so that's heartening.</p>
          <p>In terms of some of the noise that you're seeing around with rumors about Treasury taking on advisors, I wouldn't take too much from that. That's simply &#x2013; if it's true, what I would expect them to do as they start to think about some of the factors going into it. So there's a lot of excitement building and I think that's great, there's a lot of interest and enthusiasm in the topic.</p>
          <p>But I'm really just keeping people's expectations, certainly internally, relatively low; keeping them focused on the job; and the IPO will happen in good time when the company is ready and when the markets are ready. I'm sorry I can't be anything other than more general than that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I think to put a finer point on the earlier question, does 11 million breakeven, which you just now said, does that represent a change from 10 million that the company said earlier? Or, I know you said you didn't care to make that comparison, but it's kind of an obvious one to me.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're actually making money at around 11 million units or just over. So a thing that you ought to be a little careful of, and I say this to people internally, is take one absolute number like 11, there's a lot of moving parts, incentive levels et cetera. So I would say, at our current configuration in the first quarter, we would have broken even if the industry had been somewhere between 10 and 11 million units based on the mix that we had, based on the pricing we had, based on the cost structure. To my mind, that's order of magnitude the same as what probably was said a year or so ago; in fact, it might be slightly better than.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So we're probably splitting hairs, to be honest, to say whether it's 10.5, 11 approximately, slightly less than &#x2013; ballpark, at the bottom of what is &#x2013; worst cycles that we have seen, the company is managing to achieve a breakeven result, and that's a fantastic improvement from where we were a year ago. That's the big takeaway in my mind.</p>

          <p>Yes, not that that's too shabby. All right, thank you.</p>

          <p>I think that completes the questions that we have in the queue. So with that, I'd just thank everyone for your participation. As I say, hopefully you'll find this format useful and informative as we go through, and we'll keep it very much the same unless you have feedback otherwise. And we'll look forward to talking to all of you in three months' time. Thanks very much.</p>
