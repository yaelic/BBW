        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our webcast and conference call for AstraZeneca's second quarter and half year 2009 financial results.</p>
          <p>As you all know, a lot has happened in the world since January when I presented our full year 2008 results. We've seen the impact of recessionary pressures impacting many parts of the global economy, the threat of an H1N1 pandemic, and ongoing developments in healthcare reform. What has not changed in the six months is the determined execution of our strategy to drive sales growth for key brands and regions, to reshape the business to improve productivity and efficiency and to continue building a pipeline capable of sustainable value creation for shareholders and for society. Progress on all of these initiatives is reflected in our strong performance in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Here are the headline results for the first half. Simon will deal with the second quarter in his remarks. Sales in the first half were nearly $15.7 billion; that's an 8% increase in constant currency terms, flat on an actual basis including the negative impact of currency movements on the top line.</p>
          <p>There are three drivers to the strong top line performance. The first is the global economy. Back in January, we were well into the teeth of a worldwide recession, the likes of which we had not seen in decades. And we were only a matter of months distanced from a near meltdown of the global financial infrastructure. In this contest, we were understandably cautious about the near-term outlook for the pharma sector and for our business. Standing here six months later, I can assure you that market conditions are tough. To see that, you need only to look to continued price and utilization pressures in Western Europe or to the U.S. where market volume trends are essentially flat lined with branded product volumes down by double-digits. But that said, the impact of the global economy on our markets and on our business is less than we thought that it would be when we put our plans together for the year. So we are proving to be more recession resistant, though not wholly recession proof.</p>
          <p>Second, we've also driven continued strong commercial execution behind our key brands and regions, in many cases significantly outperforming market benchmarks. Our capabilities in sales and marketing are a strategic asset and are allowing us to outperform the competition in most markets around the world.</p>
          <p>And third, we benefited from what I would call one-off upsides to performance. For example, a three-month delay in the entry of generic Casodex in the U.S., or more significantly, the increased sales of Toprol-XL in the U.S. in the wake of the market withdrawal of two generic products. The last of these is clearly an unexpected opportunity that presented itself, but it took swift action by our operations people to put us in a position where we could supply the demand created by the withdrawal of the generics and my thanks goes &#x2013; go out to that operations team.</p>
          <p>Turning now to core operating profit. For the first half it was up 28% at CER to just over $6.9 billion. The strong sales growth, higher other operating income from the Abraxane and Nordic OTC product disposals, and continued operating efficiencies from our business reshaping program and ongoing cost discipline has driven the strong growth in core operating profit.</p>
          <p>Core earnings per share were up 28% to $3.22, in line with the growth in core operating profit. In bridging from core to reported EPS, in addition to the usual adjustments for amortization from MedImmune and our Merck arrangements and restructuring costs, there are two other adjustments worth noting. The Ethyol impairment in the first quarter of 2008 was $0.12. The second is $430 million or $0.30 per share legal provisions, which we've taken in the second quarter 2009, and Simon will cover those in his review. Net of these adjustments reported EPS grew by 24% to $2.66 for the first half.</p>
          <p>The Board has declared a first interim dividend of $0.59 per share and that's an increase of 7% and in line with our dividend policy. And we've raised our financial guidance for the full year. The new range for core EPS is now between $5.70 and $6.00. Simon will cover guidance in his presentation as well.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the first half performance through the lens of our key strategic priorities: growing the business, reshaping the business, and strengthening the pipeline, all of which are underpinned by our commitment to doing business responsibly, which shapes our activities around the world and across the value chain.</p>
          <p>There are two aspects of growing the business, driving key brands through strong commercial execution and extensive life cycle development projects, and driving our business beyond the established markets in North America and Western Europe into the emerging markets that are important &#x2013; that are an important source of growth for AstraZeneca's future.</p>
          <p>Looking at our sales performance in the first half, you can see that all major regions contributed to our strong performance. Sales in North America were up 9%, a reflection of the 10% growth in the U.S. If we adjust for the Toprol-XL effect, U.S. sales were up 5%, still well ahead of the U.S. market as a whole. In the rest of the world established markets, sales were up 4%. Western Europe was up 2%; that's just a bit better than the 1% growth achieved in all of 2008. Sales in Japan were up 11% with Crestor performing very well, and Crestor's performance in Australia fueled the 16% increase in other established markets. And we achieved double-digit sales growth in emerging markets in the first half, with China continuing to perform strongly at 29%.</p>
          <p>In terms of our key brands, you can see that combined sales of these five products increased by 15% to $8.9 billion. We see a resilient performance for Nexium and strong growth across the board for the others. Seroquel up 15%, fueled by the launches of Seroquel XR and the focus on bipolar disorders. Crestor up 34%, well ahead of the statin market as our positioning for higher risk patients is carving out a growing share of the market, despite the large generic segment. And then Symbicort, where the launch in the U.S. and the rollout of Symbicort SMART in the rest of the world has driven 24% growth in the first half. So strong sales performance for the key brands in all major regions.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of reshaping the business, our programs are on track to deliver the $2.1 billion in annual savings by 2010, growing to 2.5 billion by 2013. It is these efforts, as well as the everyday cost discipline that's becoming embedded in our culture that's creating the leverage between sales growth and operating profit that's reflected in our strong financial performance.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to report continued progress on the pipeline. Anders' presentation will cover this in much more detail, but a few key accomplishments worth noting. Since the first quarter results announcement, we've made three significant regulatory submissions. Certriad, the combination of Crestor and Abbott's TRILIPIX, was filed in the United States. Vimovo formerly known as PN400, the product was of our collaboration with Pozen, was also a U.S. filing, and Zactima was filed in the U.S. and in Europe. And we have a fourth submission, Brilinta, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We've also achieved some important product approvals since the first quarter. Namely we've secured approval for Iressa in Europe, a truly personalized medicine for lung cancer. And our new oral treatment for Type 2 diabetes, ONGLYZA, which we're developing in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, has received a positive recommendation for approval by the European CHMP. In the U.S., I know many of you are aware that today marks the PDUFA date, so we hope we'll receive further information on that filing very soon.</p>
          <p>Anders will take you through the detail of the pipeline, but I think it's important to highlight here that more than 40% of the pipeline comes from in licensing and acquisitions. This is the result of our determined efforts to access the very best science in our chosen therapy areas, and some 23% of the pipeline is biologics molecules. We believe that these two factors give balance to our pipeline and illustrate the potential of the biologics technology that we acquired with MedImmune.</p>
          <p>In summary, I think we've made good progress on our strategic priorities as we sit here at the halfway mark for the year.</p>
          <p>Before I hand it over to Simon Lowth, I would like to return to two other topics that affect our industry and are dominating the headlines at the movement. The first is U.S. healthcare reform. At our year-end results conference back on the 29th of January, we were barely two weeks into a new administration that had made healthcare reform a centerpiece of their election platform. Six months later, healthcare reform is front and center on the minds of the body politic in the United States. During this time in my role as chairman of our trade association, PhRMA, I have spent considerable time in Washington and working with the CEOs of the other major pharma companies, playing an active role in building working &#x2013; workable solutions to the issue. I'm proud of the vision and leadership our industry has shown by stepping up and making an $80 billion commitment over 10 years towards making comprehensive healthcare reform a reality this year.</p>
          <p>And the U.S. is not alone in looking to expand the provision of healthcare to its population by bringing more patients within reach of the modern medicines they need. In China, the government's approved a plan to invest $124 billion in the healthcare system over the next three years. And we expect healthcare reform to remain on the agenda in Europe for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>In the short-term, global healthcare reform may present a challenging headwind as we start planning for 2010 and beyond. But done in the right way, with the right incentives, it brings with it the opportunity for expanded markets, rewards for innovation, and ultimately, better healthcare for patients.</p>
          <p>The other topic that's making headlines around the world is Novel Type A H1N1 Influenza. As the world braces itself for the impact of a global pandemic, it's worth reflecting that society's best hope for an effective vaccine, widely available and in sufficient quantities, depends upon a successful partnership between health agent &#x2013; the health agencies, this industry, governments and health providers. It's clear to me that none of us can do this on our own and that the industry has a key role to play. Progress is being made in developing a vaccine for H1N1. This progress is built upon the solid foundations of prior investments in enabling science, innovative technology and significant capital investment and production capacity across the industry.</p>
          <p>These prior investments, vital today as we respond to a pandemic threat, can only be made if society continues to reward innovation over the long-term. Here at AstraZeneca, MedImmune scientists, on the back of years of investment in innovative live attenuated influenza vaccines, have successfully produced a master virus seed.</p>
          <p>Just last week at an FDA Advisory Board, we reported that based on vaccine yields of the first manufacturing lots, we may be able to produce up to 200 million doses of bulk vaccine to the H1N1 virus. Around 40 million of these doses can be filled and finished in the nasal sprayer devices currently utilized and we expect to have those available by March 2010. The number of finished filled doses is currently limited by the availability of sprayers. However we are taking steps to increase the supply of sprayers, as well as work with the U.S. government to define a regulatory path for an alternative delivery device.</p>
          <p>Volumes of this size mean that we can play a significant role in controlling the spread of the virus over the long-term. But I should point out that we only have regulatory clearance to offer the product In the United States at present. We are actively engaging with other governments and regulators to establish how we might expedite approvals in other countries. And we are also in discussion with the World Health Organization about how best to contribute to their efforts in the least developed countries. Simon will discuss how pandemic vaccine expectations feature in our revised financial guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>So, needless to say it's been a busy first half of the year. Both H1N1 flu and the continuing prospect of health reform will continue to be priorities in the second half of this year. I am very confident that the planning and engagement that's been our focus around these issues to-date will stand us in good stead in the coming months.</p>
          <p>I think I will stop here and turn it over to Simon, who will take you through the second quarter financial results. Simon, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you David and good afternoon to everyone. David summarized the first half financials, so I will focus on six topics, first, the headline numbers for the second quarter. Then I'll cover the key brand sales highlights for the quarter. Third, I'll take you through the second quarter earnings performance, with an emphasis on the key drivers of operating profit and margin. Fourthly, I'll provide a brief update on our productivity and synergy programs, I'll briefly touch on cash performance, and our steadily improving net debt position. And finally, I'll explain the upward revisions to our targets for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning first to the headline numbers for the second quarter, we achieved sales of just under $8 billion that's a 9% increase in constant currency terms. You will also have seen that the adverse impact of currency movements on the top line reduced the reported sales growth rate to zero.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit for the quarter was up 37% constant currency to $3.6 billion. That's chiefly as a result of the increased sales, the continued efficiencies in all our operating cost lines and the increase in other operating income, which for this quarter was the Nordic OTC disposal gain.</p>
          <p>You'll also note that the 5% negative impact from currency on the core operating profit line was somewhat lower than the 9% hit to the top line as the currency effects on our cost lines helps mitigate the revenue impact. Core earnings per share in the quarter were $1.64 compared with $1.25 last year. This is a 37% increase at constant currency.</p>
          <p>Making the bridge from core EPS to reported EPS in the quarter, we do have the usual adjusting items, the restructuring and MedImmune and Merck related amortization. An additional driver this quarter, and of the difference between the core and reported basis is the $0.30 per share legal provisions.</p>
          <p>Provisions totaling $430 million have been taken in the second quarter with respect to various federal and state investigations and civil litigation matters relating to drug marketing and pricing practices where we can now make a reasonable estimate of the losses expected. Net of these adjusting factors reported EPS increased by 10% at constant currency to $1.18.</p>
          <p>I will now call out some of the key brand highlights for the quarter, beginning with Nexium. In all instances the growth rates will be in constant currency terms. Nexium sales in the second quarter were up 1% to just over $1.2 billion. Sales in the U.S. were down 4% to $724 million. Dispensed retail tablet volume increased by around 0.5%; that is lower than the 3% growth, we recorded in Q1, but it's a result of the adjustment that IMS has put through with their June prescription data. We are still the only major PPI brand to grow volume in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Average realized prices were down 3%, but this includes some unfavorable adjustments to managed care rebate accruals in the prior period. The underlying price variance is probably closer to 7%. We continue to expect price declines in the high single-digits for the full year.</p>
          <p>There are two market events that may influence volume performance in the latter part of 2009 and into 2010. It's generic entrance for Prevacid, as well as OTC lansoprazole.</p>
          <p>In the rest of world markets Nexium sales were up 8% to $522 million. Sales in Western Europe were up 6%, despite the drag from German reference pricing. There was double-digit growth in Canada and Australia, and sales in emerging markets were up 8% including a 31% increase in China.</p>
          <p>Turning to Seroquel, second quarter sales were up 18% to $1.2 billion. In the U.S., Seroquel sales were up 22% to $893 million. Total prescriptions for the Seroquel franchise increased by 3.5% in the quarter with all of the growth attributable to the Seroquel XR formulation. The launch of XR has driven our dynamic share in bipolar disorder, which is the focus of all our promotional efforts now, by nearly 4% points &#x2013; four share points since the beginning of the year. As we've completely transitioned our commercial efforts to be 100% behind XR and the bipolar indications rather than Seroquel IR, we have seen the IR formulation lose some ground, while Seroquel XR accelerates and grows faster than the market. The overall franchise is growing, but not quite at the market rate for anti-psychotics. Total franchise share is off about 30 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As Seroquel XR continues to grow in acceptance, we will look to return the franchise to market growth rates and ultimately to grow total franchise share again over time. Our ability to deliver this return to total franchise growth would of course be strengthened by the addition of an approval in major depressive disorders. Our response to the CRL following the FDA Advisory Committee has now been submitted and we look for an FDA action around the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Seroquel sales in the rest of the world were $356 million, that's up 11% despite the 70% decline in Canada due to generic competition. The bipolar indications and the Seroquel XR formulation are driving this growth. Sales in Western Europe were up 22% and sales in emerging markets were up 28%.</p>
          <p>Crestor sales were up 33% in the quarter, exceeding $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Sales in the U.S. were up 32% to $547 million. Crestor total prescriptions increased by 25%. That's nearly four times the statin market growth rate of 6.5%, and it's keeping pace with the 26% growth for generic simvastatin.</p>
          <p>Crestor's share of total prescriptions in the U.S. continued to increase, reaching 10.8% in June. Crestor's dynamic share, that's new and switched patients is now over 15%, ahead of Lipitor and now second only to simvastatin. Crestor's sales in the rest of the world are up 35% to $582 million. As in the U.S., we're growing share at a pace that is three to four times the statin market in both our established and emerging markets. There was good growth in Western Europe, Canada, in Australia and in Japan.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, regulatory filings for a label change to reflect the JUPITER data are now under review in the U.S. and in Europe.</p>
          <p>The last product I want to cover is Symbicort. Symbicort's sales in the second quarter were up 24% to $551 million. Sales in the U.S. nearly doubled to $111 million. Symbicort accounted for most of the 7% growth in prescriptions for fixed combination products in the quarter, paced by continued penetration of the asthma market, as well as the launch of the COPD indication. Symbicort's share of new prescriptions for fixed combination products increased to 13.9% in June, up more than a full percentage point in the quarter, and market share of patients new to fixed combination therapy is now 22.9%. In the rest of the world, Symbicort's sales increased by 15% to $440 million. Sales growth is being fueled by Symbicort SMART, which has now been approved in 96 markets. Sales in Western Europe were up 15%. Sales in emerging markets were up 19%.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the second quarter P&amp;L and the drivers of the growth in core operating profit. I'll focus here on core margins and profit. The press release does of course contain the statutory numbers and a detailed reconciliation to the core measures. As with sales, when I refer to growth rates, they will all be on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Core gross margin at 82.7% of sales was a 70 basis point improvement over 2008 in constant currency terms. Principal contributors were lower Merck payments as a percent of sales, efficiency gains, and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher royalty payments.</p>
          <p>Core R&amp;D expenditures were 3% lower in the quarter. We continue to drive productivity and efficiencies in R&amp;D. This allows us to absorb increased activity related to progressing the pipeline and our investments in biologics. There are also lower costs associated with the large Crestor JUPITER and Brilinta PLATO trials this year, compared to last year. And as we previously flagged, we took a $44 million intangible impairment for the MAP unit dose budesonide in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense was 8% lower than the second quarter last year. We continue to invest to grow our emerging markets business, but this was more than offset by delivery of efficiencies in our underlying SG&amp;A costs and the reduction in certain legal expenses compared to last year. I still expect the combination of R&amp;D and SG&amp;A to come in broadly flat in constant currency terms for the full year.</p>
          <p>Core other income for the first quarter was $349 million; that's $141 million higher than 2008, chiefly as a result of the Nordic OTC disposal where we booked a $220 million gain. You'll recall that we have guided for core other income of around $900 million for the full year, and that still looks to be about right. But when modeling our second half results, do keep in mind that we've already realized more than two thirds of that. And this is one of several reasons why you can't simply double our first half results and expect us to do that for the full year.</p>
          <p>Core operating margin for the quarter was 45.3% of sales compared to 34.4% in the second quarter of 2008. 200 basis points of the improvement were related to currency. Operating margins therefore improved by 890 basis points on a constant currency basis. This comprised a 150 basis point increase from other operating income with the balance of 740 basis points coming from operating leverage against the strong 9% increase in sales. As I said earlier, we're looking at R&amp;D and SG&amp;A combined at flat in constant currency terms, so this second quarter operating margin is unlikely to be sustainable for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning to our productivity program, we've taken restructuring charges of $190 million in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $262 million. The program is on track for both costs incurred and benefits being realized. Based on our latest view of the phasing, we're likely to incur another $450 million or so in restructuring charges in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow. Cash generated from operations increased by $1 billion in the first half of 2009, driven by strong underlying operational performance and improved working capital management, partially offset by some higher tax payments. Of the $5.3 billion of operating free cash flow, we've invested about $0.5 billion in capital and intangible assets to drive future business growth and productivity. And we distributed 2.1 billion to shareholders through payment of the final 2008 dividend. The residual cash flow has reduced on net debt to $4.2 billion. This is now decreased by more than $6 billion compared to June 2008 and by $3 billion since the beginning of 2009. As you know, there were no share repurchases in the first half and none are planned for the rest of 2009, in keeping with the Board's policy for the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'll explain the drivers of the increase in our full year guidance. As David mentioned in his opening remarks, our planning assumptions, made in the context of some pretty dire economic conditions at the end of last year, led us to a cautious revenue outlook for 2009. Whilst market conditions are difficult, the impact has been less than we had thought.</p>
          <p>We've also delivered strong operational performance in the market versus our competitors, both in regional and key brand sales performance, and in continuing to drive productivity and efficiencies across the entire company. And we've benefited from some one-off items that have lifted our first half performance, chiefly the Toprol-XL benefit and some delays to anticipated generic entries including Casodex in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our increased full year EPS guidance reflects this strong first half performance. It also allows for some continued out performance versus our original expectations in the second half, including our best view on Toprol for the second half.</p>
          <p>We also have to take a view on another one-off factor, that's the potential revenue from the H1N1 pandemic vaccine. We already have U.S. government orders for $151 million and most of this revenue should be recognized under the contract in the second half of this year. Our guidance range is also based on the potential for new government vaccine orders up to our near-term finish and fill capacity of around 40 million doses.</p>
          <p>When doing your own modeling do bear in mind that normal seasonal flu mist is a below average margin product for us; pandemic vaccine, as it is at government contract pricing, is lower still. Our guidance range does not account for any potential upside beyond the 40 million doses of finish and fill capacity. As Dave had mentioned, we do have theoretical bulk capacity of some 200 million doses should additional nasal sprays be obtained or an alternative delivery strategy be agreed.</p>
          <p>So for our revised guidance for the full year, we now estimate sales growth will be around mid single-digits at constant currency, and I would estimate about half of that is due to what we described as the one-off effects. The other elements of our guidance are broadly the same. So it's largely the revenue upside that leads us to our new target range for core EPS, which is now between $5.70 and $6.00.</p>
          <p>Just to be perfectly clear, there is no currency component to this upgrade. Actual currencies for the first half have been broadly neutral compared to our currency assumption for guidance, namely the January 2009 average rates. Of course we're taking no view of the future movements for currency, so going forward, this guidance takes no account of the likelihood that average exchange rates for the remainder of the year may differ materially from the January 2009 average rates. And as usual, I point you to our currency sensitivity chart to help you flex your own estimates on the currency impact to sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>I think I'll wrap up my formal remarks here and turn things over to Anders Ekblom, who'll provide a pipeline update. Anders?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Simon. I'm very pleased to provide you with my first R&amp;D half-year review, especially in this exciting period of late stage delivery for our R&amp;D organization. There has been a tremendous degree of change within the industry generally and with our R&amp;D efforts specifically in AstraZeneca. We have seen our pipeline grow and mature and significantly expand into biologics.</p>
          <p>We now have an organization that is more focused, cost-conscious and productive. We have seen a transformational change in our science and technology base as well as our partnering approach. This degree of change will become normal as we continue to be passionate about science while at the same time ensuring we get an attractive return on the investment we make in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>During the first of half of 2009, we have continued to strengthen the pipeline and have seen strong evidence for its growing maturity. Key accomplishments have been the approval and launch of Iressa in Europe, while ONGLYZA's registration is progressing strongly with a positive FDA Advisory Committee in the U.S. and the CHMP approval recommendation in Europe.</p>
          <p>We had three other NCE submissions with Certriad, Vimovo and Zactima and have made significant progress in our life cycle management activities for which the delivery of the Crestor JUPITER sNDA and MAA was a particular highlight. Brilinta has been another key accomplishment as the PLATO study achieved its primary endpoint. In addition to the progress our projects are making, our productivity initiatives also continue to provide benefits. We're faster and leaner than ever before and are striving to continuously improve as we move forward managing our cost base.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our late-stage portfolio, which I will cover over the next few minutes in some depth. As you can see from this chart, we're steadily transitioning our Phase III projects into the registration face of their life cycle. We filed four projects last year, two of which were biologics. We are also on track to deliver four this year, as well as the projects due to be filed during 2010 and 2011. Of course, the ultimate result is not the filing, but it's launching these medicines and making them available to patients. We are working very hard within R&amp;D as well as with regulators and our marketing colleagues to do just that.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned already, we have launched Iressa in Europe and hopefully next in line is our most mature Phase III project, our joint development with BMS of ONGLYZA, the DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. There remains a very high unmet need in diabetes with significant morbidity and mortality. It currently affects 246 million people worldwide and is set to increase to 380 million patients by 2025. 50% of treated patients do not reach glycemic control and therefore it's clear that additional therapies like the growing DPP-4 class are required.</p>
          <p>Our discussions with the regulatory authorities are progressing well. In Europe, we received a positive CHMP opinion, which is currently awaiting a decision by the European Parliament. In the U.S., as David mentioned earlier, the PDUFA date is today. Discussions with FDA are progressing well and we remain confident in the comprehensiveness of the regulatory submission we made. I'm sure you will also appreciate that there is little more that I can add at this point other than to say that we're hoping to have positive news very soon. As you know, we intend to conduct a cardiovascular events study, and planning is at an advanced stage so it can be initiated post approval.</p>
          <p>Another key filing is Certriad, our investigation medicine developed with Abbott for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. It contains the active ingredients of our statin Crestor and TRILIPIX, or fenofibric acid.</p>
          <p>Certriad provides efficacy benefit by controlling the three primarily lipid targets, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides as you can see from this chart, it targets distinct patient population currently uncontrolled by existing treatment alternatives. In the U.S., there are currently 46 million patients on medication, 29 million of which remain uncontrolled. A significant segment of these patients could potentially benefit from Certriad. We're now submitting an NDA one quarter ahead of our previously communicated timelines.</p>
          <p>The next key filing delivered during the first half of 2009 is Vimovo. The NDA was filed with the FDA on June 30, and pending U.S. regulatory approval, Vimovo is the proposed trade name for PN400. It is a fixed dose combination of enteric-coated naproxen and immediate release esomeprazole in a sequential release formulation that we have developed with Pozen for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in patients at risk of developing NSAID associated gastric ulcers.</p>
          <p>There are currently 140 million osteoarthritis patients worldwide. Up to 30% of these patients switch or augment their therapy in a year, either because they do not get the pain relief they seek or because of side effects, and up to 50% of OA patients taking NSAIDs are at risk of developing NSAIDs associated gastric ulcers, representing a large unmet need for this patient population. The two pivotal registration studies, 301 and 302, demonstrated that the incidence of gastric ulcers was significantly lower in patients taking Vimovo compared with enteric-coated naproxen through six months. Abstracts have been submitted to congresses including ACR and ACG. From a regulatory point of view, Posen submitted an NDA to the FDA on June 30 and we're on track to submit an MAA during the fourth quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to oncology, Zactima is the first oral targeted therapy to show evidence of clinical benefits when adding to chemotherapy in Phase III studies in second line non-small-cell lung cancer. We recently filed submissions in the U.S. and Europe for the use of Zactima 100mg in combination with chemotherapy for this patient group. Results from ZEPHYR, the 300mg monotherapy studying EGFR failures in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and ZETA, the 300mg monotherapy in advanced medullary thyroid cancer will be presented during the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>This concludes the update on our recent approvals and submissions. And I would now like to provide you with the status of our other Phase III products, starting with Brilinta. This is our investigational oral antiplatelet treatment for acute coronary syndromes, ACS. It is estimated that one in three ACS patients will die, have a recurrent heart attack or be readmitted to hospital within six months of their first cardiovascular event. This points to a continuing need for more effective safe ACS treatment options.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, we announced that PLATO, our large 18,000 patient trial, demonstrated that Brilinta achieved a statistically significant primary efficacy endpoint versus clopidogrel. The primary efficacy measure was timed to first occurrence of an event from the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV death. The overall safety profile of Brilinta was inline with the safety data observed in the Phase II studies. Given the size of the study, further analysis of the database, secondary variables, and subgroups is ongoing.</p>
          <p>I understand there is considerable interest in the PLATO results, but as you would expect, details will have to wait until we present the results at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting on the 30th of August. We'll also aim to submit the data to peer reviewed medical journals. The submission to regulatory authorities remain on schedule for the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our Recentin program is progressing well and we're on track to deliver the colorectal cancer and recurrent glioblastoma submissions in the second half 2010. In colorectal cancer, HORIZON II and III studies have now fully recruited, while in recurrent glioblastoma recruitment of the Phase III REGAL program is on schedule. The broad single search program continues to reinforce activity of this molecule with efficacy signals seen in a range of tumors. Posters were presented at ASCO on the findings early this year.</p>
          <p>Earlier I talked about ONGLYZA. The other compound in our joint development alliance with BMS is Dapagliflozin, the potential first in class SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. The Phase III program is progressing well with 11 studies ongoing, eight of which are fully recruited, two having completed their initial six month treatment period.</p>
          <p>We presented further Phase IIb data at the ADA earlier this year showing that in a 12-week study Dapagliflozin improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients who were inadequately controlled despite high doses of insulin and common oral antidiabetic medicine. Six month results from two Phase III studies will be presented at the EASD and IDF congresses in October this year. We are on track to make our first submission during the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>The next compound I would like to update you on is ZD4054. This is the potential first-in-class endothelin A antagonist in hormone resistant prostate cancer patients with metastatic and non-metastatic disease. We are making significant progress with our Phase III ENTHUSE program as the launch indication M1 study has fully recruited and the follow-up indication studies, M1 combination and M0 are actively recruiting.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the biologics side of our business and the final Phase III project presented today, Motavizumab. We continue to work on the Complete Response Letter for Motavizumab and are expecting to submit our response to the FDA in the second half of the year. MedImmune has completed the second season studying congestive heart disease and will include the CHD data as part of the Complete Response Letter response to FDA. Our Rest of World partner for Synagis Motavizumab is Abbott International, and they plan to wait until we have incorporated the CHD data into the file before submitting in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine continues to make progress as well, with several regulatory filings now completed. The review of our MAA file late last year continues as expected. Our application in Hong Kong was submitted in the first half of 2009, while AstraZeneca Canada submitted a new drug submission for FluMist to Health Canada on July 20. Finally, on the pandemic side, David has already covered the significant progress we are making on producing a candidate for a novel Influenza A H1N1 vaccine.</p>
          <p>Continuing with the life cycle management update, another key accomplishment is the progress that has been made with the Iressa. Building on the success in Asia, Iressa is developing into a significant brand for AstraZeneca. It is the first and the only targeted therapy to show superior efficacy to doublet chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</p>
          <p>Data shown on this chart from the Pan-Asian IPASS study shows superior progression free survival for Iressa compared to doublet chemotherapy in EGFR mutation positive patients. EGFR mutation status was a strong predictive biomarker, providing a truly personalized healthcare approach. European approval was achieved across all lines of therapy for EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer patients based on the interest in IPASS studies, as well as the full data review.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Crestor now. I will outline our life cycle management activities that will fully maximize this product's potential, mainly JUPITER, SATURN, and PLUTO. Starting with JUPITER, we followed up our presentation of the initial results at AHA at the end of last year with the presentation of equally impressive results on stroke and VTE from the trial during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>As a reminder of the profound impact the Cervastatin 20 milligram demonstrated in this trial, the graph percentage shows the primary endpoint data with a 44% relative risk reduction. No other statin has demonstrated this magnitude of risk reduction in a placebo-controlled trial. The JUPITER sNDA and MAA in U.S. and Europe and other major markets are under active review.</p>
          <p>SATURN is a follow up to our successful ASTEROID IVUS trial, where regressional coronary atherosclerosis was demonstrated for the first time in a major chemical trial with a statin. SATURN is a head to head IVUS trial comparing Crestor rosuvastatin and is on track to deliver results in 2011. In April, we submitted PLUTO in both the U.S. as well as Europe seeking a pediatric indication. Based on the PLUTO submission, we can now announce that we have successfully fulfilled our U.S. pediatric exclusivity requirements for Crestor and we were informed earlier this month that as a result, we've been granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our Seroquel immediate release bipolar and XR bipolar MDD and GAD lifecycle management program is moving forward. In the U.S., Thursday issued complete response letters for both MDD and GAD, sNDAs requiring additional information. We have prioritized the resubmission of MDD over GAD. We have issued a response and we expect a decision during the fourth quarter of this year. For GAD, we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA. In Europe, we've referred our application for XR for patients with MDD to the CHMP and expect an opinion during the last quarter of this year. For the European GAD application, we expect a read out from the Mutual Recognition Procedure, also by the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In other markets, Seroquel XR for MDD has been approved in Canada and Australia. Finally, our bipolar suite of indications is progressing to plan across all key markets.</p>
          <p>Lifecycle management also continues strongly for Symbicort. In the U.S., we have received approval and launch to COPD indication. Our pediatrics sNDA received a complete response letter in April. We are working on our response, which we will provide to the FDA during the second half of this year and it is likely to require new clinical studies. In Japan, although we initially had a delay due to the backlog of reviews at the regulator agency, we now expect to receive an approval of the asthma indication during the fourth quarter of this year. At the same time, we are making progress on the COPD and asthma Symbicort SMART programs in Japan. In other markets, we launched Symbicort SMART in China during the first quarter and are in track to launch a COPD indication in China, Australia, and Canada during the second half of '09.</p>
          <p>Finally Faslodex, this is a product whose lifecycle management activities have not featured in our R&amp;D updates for some time. Following a positive outcome in the Faslodex CONFIRM Phase III trail, which compares the efficacy of the currently licensed 250mg with the 500mg dose, we are exploring with a number of health authorities the possibility of a label change in order to bring the benefit of the higher dose to patients. We plan to present the results of this study at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference in December.</p>
          <p>I would now like to provide you with an overview of our pipeline. On the next few slides I will focus on the clinical component of our pipeline. Back in January 2009, we had 98 projects in clinical development and in a portfolio of this size, there will inevitably be a significant number of products that fail or are stopped for a number of different reasons. In the first half of this year we had nine withdrawals overall.</p>
          <p>However, these were more than matched by products that have progressed to the next step or to a regulatory filing. The green boxes represent the 11 products that progress to the next phase, while the five amber ones are those that have been filed with the registration authorities. As late stage products are launched we can expect them to come off the lifecycle management section of this table. And of course we have continued to introduce new molecules shown here in red. So across the clinical portfolio we had 12 new products added since January.</p>
          <p>Looking at the pipeline overall, we are seeing strong evidence of its maturity. We are delivering the late stage products while at the same time discovering early stage productivity has been maintained at the steady state levels we require in order to meet our overall targets. We now have a balanced portfolio representative of the investment we've made in alliances and biologics over the last years. So in conclusion, I believe that we're at an exciting period of late stage delivery. We are moving key Phase III products into the registration stage of their lifecycle, while our lifecycle management activities are maximizing the potential of marketed products such as Crestor and Iressa.</p>
          <p>All in all, at this half-year point, we are confident that we will meet the targets we set ourselves for this year. We've already delivered three out of the four submissions we expected for 2009, and the fourth, Brilinta, is on track for the fourth quarter. We've delivered a lot, but as ever, there's still a lot more to do. As a scientist and a clinician, I I'm passionate about continuously improving the science and innovation that underpins our portfolio. At the same time, as a business leader, I will ensure that we manage the cost base within R&amp;D in the most efficient way possible.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to hand you back to David.</p>

          <p>Great Anders. Thank you. And thank you, Simon also for your comments. We will now move on to the Q&amp;A session.

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, great, thank you. Pfizer has given long-term guidance to 2012. Sanofi yesterday gave guidance to 2013. I'm wondering when we can expect Astra to give long-term guidance. With the various big patent expirations you face, I think investors have some apprehension about what the future may hold and I'm wondering if we might be able to get numbers from you guys at some point extending out this far, and I guess related to the longer term outlook, can you point us to the one or two Phase II compounds in your pipeline that you are most excited about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good. Well thanks Tim. Our practice has always been to stick with guidance that we've given and we do that on an annual basis and we saw that some others are starting to give longer term guidance, but I think our view on that is we will at this point stick with it. We don't have any particular plans to give longer term guidance, but we're constantly looking at the horizon to try to see what else we can be indicating that makes good sense for investors to know. Simon, do you want to add anything there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the Phase II compounds, we generally don't highlight any particular programs from the Phase II part of our product update. So I think the focus is really on updating on the Phase III programs and then some of the phase IIb data when it becomes available, but that probably has more to do with the science than not, so we're &#x2013; I'm not going to pick anything out from that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions. First on Brilinta and the Phase III profiles being inline with Phase II. I was wondering if you could answer whether given that you had similar to lower major bleeding especially around procedures and the loading dose, are you able to confirm that that's the case, and if not, could you at least talk about how the bleeding definition differs from Phase II to Phase III and how that might impact interpretation? And then secondly for Crestor and Certriad how much of Crestor's sales are currently in the Certriad target patients? And that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good. Well. I will ask Anders maybe to make a comment about the Phase II program from Brilinta since the Phase III data is not available, so we haven't made any particular comparisons on it. Anders, do you want to comment on where we were from the safety perspective with the data that's been put in the public domain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks David. I think as I said earlier on in my presentation, the guidance being given around the safety data, considering that this is a very large file analysis is ongoing is that what we've seen is that it's in line with the Phase II data shown and I would like to avoid going into any details you are asking for. I think the general guidance being given is around the bleeds to ventricle lipolysis and risk from uric acid. We are sort of on par with what you have seen in Phase II. So I think that's a reasonable assumption right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Onto your second question then Gbola on the Certriad. I mean there are distinct separate segments. I think the slide that we used kind of talked about some 46 million people in the treated dyslipidemia population, but a large number of them are uncontrolled. I think we estimate that to be just under 30 million people and then within that there is a target group of people that's less than half, but probably a pretty significant population of people for that reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I mean you can calculate 8 billion of potential in that market. The question &#x2013; does Crestor generally get used in those patients already and so how much cannibalization might there be if they're completely clean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our view of the market is that there is minimal overlap, that this much more third complexity in the mixed dyslipidemia patient is something where obviously Crestor gets used some, but I think our view is there is a distinct segment here and that's what we are going pursue with Certriad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, are there draft guidelines on JUPITER, Crestor JUPITER coming at AHA in November? Is that your expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not familiar with the timing of the guidelines. So I don't have any sense of that, but no Gbola, I don't think right now &#x2013; I don't think we are aware of it right now.</p>
          <p>Good, thank you. I am going to go &#x2013; just we have an e-mail question in from Christopher Lilberg Svendsen from Carnegie. Actually there are a couple of questions here. Let me just read them and then I will ask Simon to comment. There are three questions. In the new guidance what's your assumptions for Toprol-XL in the U.S. for the remainder of the year? U.S. Seroquel sales also seem high when adjusting for the price increase. Is that explained by the stocking effects in the quarter? And then how much of the $2.1 billion savings have you achieved so far? So Simon, can I ask you to comment on those three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Let me take them in just in reverse order. In the restructuring we said at the &#x2013; in January with our full year results for '08, we said that we'd delivered two-thirds of the 1,400 million benefits to the P&amp;L in 2008 and that the remaining sort of 1,500 of the benefit stream would be delivered as 1,100 million in '09 and '10 and then a remaining 400 million by 2013 and that the 1,100 million additional benefit in '09 and '10 we said they'd be evenly phased over '09 and '10. So that's a reminder of the guidance we provided and we are absolutely on track with that during the course of this year. So that's the 2.1 billion savings.</p>
          <p>If we turn to your question Christopher about U.S. Seroquel sales, no there hasn't been an appreciable stocking effect for the quarter. We're growing volumes in the franchise globally. There is also a positive mix component to the growth into both geographic and dosage range and we've also had some increases in realized prices, both through this price increases and some benefit of sort of prior adjustments of managed market accruals. But it's not a stocking issue. It's volume, price and a bit of mix.</p>
          <p>And your third question, assumptions for Toprol-XL in the U.S. The situation as you know with Toprol is that two of the generics were withdrawn from the market. We were able to as David mentioned very rapidly ramp up our production in order to meet patient needs. There's therefore the branded product and an authorized generic on the market and that's been providing the growth in the first part of the year. Clearly in remainder of the year there's the possibility for one or both of the generics to return to the market and indeed the potential for further approval. We don't have a point estimate. Our range allows for a range of scenarios and &#x2013; but included within the range is a scenario where there will be additional competition before the end of the year. So hopefully that covers the three questions, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. Thanks for those. Back to the telephones. Kevin Scotcher, you're on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. I've got two quick questions. Firstly, the Crestor patent trial date in the U.S. It was February Q1, didn't have the date in. The Q2 announcement doesn't have a date in. But your June presentation had the February date. Is it February for the trial or do we not have a date right now? And my second question's related to Seroquel XR in MDD, the answer to the FDA's Complete Response Letter. Is it fair for us to assume given the Advisory Committee was talking about changing indication to adjunctive use in MDD, is it fair for us to assume that the indication is the same as the original indication or perhaps have you changed the indication that you are asking for in your resubmission?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well let me just start with the Crestor patent quickly to say yeah, right now it's our understanding that the trial is currently scheduled for February 2010 and that is why we put it out there. Regarding the review of the CRL and our submission of the CRL for MDD, we don't get into specifics around regulatory discussion on these things. The Advisory Committee came out with the position and we are in the process of discussing that with the agency, so I think that's as far as I can go with it right now Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. All right, let me go to Marcel Brand, at Cheuvreux. Marcel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my question. But sorry for coming back to, on that Seroquel question. Seroquel we've seen a shift obviously through lower dose use bipolar disease and that hasn't shortened, in spite of price increases, the value per prescription has remained stable for the last three years. Still, there is here now a 15% deviation in terms of value per prescription compared to the last eight quarters. You say there is no stocking effect. If there then may be a one time sale or is there anything that is not captured through the IMS channels here?</p>
          <p>Then on the 430 million charge, can you talk a bit more about the nature of that charge, which products are affected and also can you comment on the lack of tax deductibility or at least partial lack of tax deductibility?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on FluMist, did you get any indications from the FDA as to approvability? It seems that a live attenuated vaccine has at least so far been considered by regulators at least a bit more complex in terms of approval from a safety viewpoint than the attenuated vaccine &#x2013; than the, sorry, the attenuated vaccines have been considered a bit more coming from the safety viewpoint than the, than your competitors' vaccines. And my question is does the FDA maybe apply similar standards to them as the conjugated vaccines?</p>
          <p>And last question, sorry I forgot that, the 9% headwinds on the currency side, that is more than in Q1, I am wondering why that is because based on the currency moves you would have expected a little bit less of a headwind to this quarter. Thanks.</p>

          <p>All right. Four questions. Let me just make a quick comment around the charge. The only thing we really will say about the charge is what we put in the press release, that we're taking it, the provision, with respect to the federal and state investigations and some civil litigation regarding our marketing practices. We're not going to take it any further than that. I'm not sure whether we have a comment about tax deductibility. Simon is there much to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's &#x2013; the provision covers as David said a variety of investigation and legal matters. We've taken a prudent perspective from a tax in not allowing any tax deductibility. Clearly we will be able to assess that position as the situations develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then on the Seroquel, I mean I didn't say it but obviously we believe that the opportunity in the major depressive disorder area because Seroquel did show a differentiated profile is something that we think can give us some additional support in the marketplace depending on how the label comes out and when it happens, but as we said, we're in the process of trying to work through that. As it relates to the value per prescription and maybe some of the either channel changes or potentially lower doses, Simon do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think the &#x2013; to just confirm, we've haven't seen a significant stocking effect. I think I covered the main reasons in my response to the first question, which was we've seen some volume growth. We've seen some mix benefits as we look across the franchise globally. In addition to that, we have seen some increases in realized prices and that does include and I touched briefly on this, some adjustments in the managed market accruals. So we accrue for expected estimated rebates, discounts and so forth for a number of our channels. We then true them up on a retrospective basis and if there's &#x2013; in this particular case, we've had some benefit from the true-up process in this quarter. But hopefully that gives you what we can say on the Seroquel.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean we provide a currency sensitivity model at the beginning of the year. We show what we expect to be the impact on both sales and earnings for different movements in currency. Now that's obviously based upon our view of the year ahead and there will be, it will be an estimate based on that view. If there are changes on a quarter-by-quarter basis to the relative mix of sales, the estimator could be slightly out on any one quarter and I think in Q2 you saw that effect both on the sales line and on the earnings line. But we continue to see that as a useful tool for you for the full year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on FluMist, I would just remind everyone that our seasonal FluMist vaccine is approved in the United States only and the H1 so that &#x2013; and our seasonal vaccine now has actually been &#x2013; we're shipping. The government has gone ahead and authorized us to do that. So our seasonal vaccine is out. I mentioned we've had what looks like pretty productive work through our technology in developing the seed and therefore the government did contract with us to purchase some of the product. So it's approved. We have clinical tests we do. We do that every year for the seasonal vaccines; it tends to be in adults and children oriented towards safety. Obviously the agency retains the right to figure out what else they want to do, but right now, they have contracted to buy vaccine and expect to take delivery of it so -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, the H1N1, isn't that a different situation because this is obviously not a normal human virus and do you want to come in with an attenuated vaccine there? Is there some concern for &#x2013; in terms of a very widespread vaccination campaign?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think our belief is that we've demonstrated the safety and efficacy of our seasonal vaccine and the H1N1 is going to be developed through the same technology and brought to the market that way. So we obviously will be looking at all of that in our clinical trail, in the clinical work that we are going to do in the next couple of months.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no not aware of anything. They have pandemic contracts that they've awarded and we have been part of it. So I think, obviously this is not a business as usual type of situation for anyone, right? I think we view this as a pretty significant public health challenge first and foremost, so I think it's probably not business as usual. I think &#x2013; we're working alongside the government authorities, the World Health Organization, to try to make sure that as much product that can be made available as possible and I think the expectations are these products will have a similar profile to the existing vaccines.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, there is an email question and then we will go to Sachin Jain at Merrill Lynch, but let me do the question I mean over the web. Can you comment on the pricing developments of Toprol-XL during Q2, and whether this is sustainable? Also differentiation between Seroquel IR and XR pricing please?</p>
          <p>I think our expectations around Toprol-XL pricing in the marketplace are dependent upon the number of generic products that are there, so sustainability is around the number of products that are in the market. And as other generics potentially come back onto the market, that could change. Pricing between IR and XR, they were comparably priced at the time they were introduced. I believe just through some pricing activity, there is a bit of differentiation now, but I don't think that it's driving a significant valuation change in terms of overall sales. All right, I'm going to go to Sachin Jain now at Merrill Lynch.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Three questions if I could. Firstly on the guidance, you mentioned around half the sales upgrade is one-offs. Is it fair to assume that you're getting higher than average margins on those one-offs? I'm just trying to take into account your comments on FluMist and therefore that one-offs are more than half of the EPS upgrade. Secondly just back to longer term discussions. I wondered, I expect that you can't provide longer term guidance, whether you could provide some color on some of the discussion points that other companies have had on some pressures to long-term margins and notably healthcare reform, changing emerging markets mix, patent pressure obviously, increasing in-licensing on your pipeline? You mentioned 40% in-licensed. And just one R&amp;D question on Certriad, just how important is a positive outcome from the ACCORD study to you being able to access that untapped patient pool and what challenges would you face if that study was negative with the two negative mortality fibrate studies? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay well, I'll let Anders maybe make some comments about Certriad and the ACCORD study if he has got that information available and Simon can comment on guidance and the impact of the one-offs from a margin perspective. You asked about just some color on the pressures going forward: healthcare reform, emerging markets et cetera. I go back to the point I reinforced I think in my opening comments around the things that we're focused on. Obviously you asked about licensing and bringing in external opportunities. Obviously improving research and development productivity from our perspective and strengthening our pipeline is our highest priority and we do that internally and externally and I think we're more discriminating in the types of products that we develop now and bring to the market because I think the market going forward is going to be more discriminating about the products that it's willing to pay for. They really need to bring a differentiated value to patients in the market, but I believe that there will continue to be recognition of that differentiated value proposition for products and it's not just an economic proposition. There is a quality of life proposition associated with that. So I think it's a balanced view of which products make a difference, especially given the genericization of markets. We see this happening.</p>
          <p>So on the healthcare reform side of things, and certainly the U.S. it's still very difficult to call as you probably all of you see. There are a number of bills that have been introduced. There are negotiations and debate going on right now just within the House and within the Senate. They haven't even tried to reconcile that yet. So I think our view is we need to follow and see, but we're supportive both as a company, and leading the PhRMA organization, I can tell you the leadership of this industry, the CEOs are behind the idea of that healthcare reform is a good thing for the future in the U.S. and we see some reform happening in other places. I mentioned China. I think it's a good example.</p>
          <p>And you asked about the emerging markets and I go back to then the points I made, strengthening the pipeline, growing our business, which is all about making sure that we're positioned well in markets where there is opportunity for growth, and as I said, I don't think we expect emerging markets to have straight-line growth, but we're continuing to invest where it's appropriate to do that because they are continuing to invest in healthcare and that's going to bring some value opportunities for companies who have products and differentiated products.</p>
          <p>And then on the reshape the business, that third point I think I made earlier, I think you can see from our expense management and the impact of our restructuring, we're able to leverage that to improve our margin to some degree. I think it will vary from time-to-time, but it's the operational performance that we're absolutely committed to. Over to Anders maybe to comment on Certriad and ACCORD.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks David. As you know Certriad is a good combination between two very sort of efficacious treatments. I think if you sort of take that and sort of versus the ACCORD trial, which is pretty complicated looking both in glycemic control, hypertension and lipids, I think sort of what you could expect from ACCORD is to provide a good rationale from an outcomes perspective for looking on the statin and a fibrating combination, but I don't think it's critical or crucial for the success of Certriad, but it may add to sort of our knowledge base in this field.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good and Simon over to you maybe just to give a sense around the guidance and was it impacted by one-offs and what are the margins for the one-offs impacting significantly your approach to giving guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is no. We said that half of the increase in our sales expectations is to one-off items. You'll note that we kept the other elements of our guidance unchanged, including at the gross margin level, some of the one-off items, the Toprol effect is at a higher gross margin but the flu as I mentioned is somewhat lower gross margin. So overall, we're seeing the outlook for year unchanged on the other margin and cost lines as I said.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of quick points on Brilinta which hopefully you can answer. Firstly, can you just confirm that there was no imbalance in the rate of cancers in that study between the 6140 and the placebo arm? And just also whether or not within the design of the study, the patients are continued on treatment after the official end of the study and why that decision was taken?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well certainly I can go over to Anders, but I think we've been pretty clear. We can't talk about the comparative data between the Phase II and Phase III or even what's going on. Do you want to make any comment about that Anders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I mean I agree with that David. I think we've been pretty clear that analysis ongoing and we will come back in Barcelona August 30 with more details or answer of the questions asked for. It just struck me that I perhaps should go back to the bleeding definition. I'm not sure I responded to that in a good way or rather I miffed it out in my response. I also want to comment upon that question the comparison between sort of the definitions used by others and what we use for PLATO. And I believe it's well covered in the PLATO design papers, which actually were published in the American Heart Journal. And I think it's worth understanding when you start comparing sort of our date would Prasugrel and Plavix that those differences in the bleeding scales may have an impact. So you have to be pretty clear about that. But I would recommend that you go back to the design paper and build it from there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Just wanted to come back to a couple of questions, one on Seroquel, just to put a line on the sand on it, but can you just explain of the 22% increase and 3.5% with TRX, what was the portion of the remainder that was therefore price that you've taken on the franchise and mix?</p>
          <p>Secondarily, just a point of clarification if I may on Dapagliflozin in terms of the filing timeline. Is this first half '10, is that Europe or U.S. or both and just wanted to make sure we were clear on the CV guidelines and whether you had enough patients to address that?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly on the guidance, I guess just wanted to think about how we go through into 2010 if I may, but obviously I guess you're highlighting half of the boost to your guidance this year is from essentially one-off items. And do you think you can do better than flat on '09 in terms of 2010? I am just trying to get a sense for where the cost items sort of cost growth looks for '10 and what implications that might have versus '09 and the lack of one-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'll see if we can get some specific between the price volume and mix around Seroquel beyond what we've already said, but I can tell you &#x2013; you are going to have to wait for January for our 2010 guidance. So I think with &#x2013; at this point we will work through the second half of the year, you can see given that there are a number of moving parts that are affecting it from good operating performance on the top line exclusive of the generic products, that the success we've had with products where the generics haven't been on the market or came late coupled with just our overall operating performance, it's had a positive effect, but I think our point is there is going to be some variability around that and we try to look at it on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>Your question about Dapa in the first half of 2010, I will ask Anders to comment on that as well and then ask Simon to comment on guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Dapa, David, the information in the pipeline actually states very clearly, we are going to file both the NDA and MAA second half 2010. According to the CV guidelines, during the program we've received a letter from FDA, which is very corresponding with what you can see on the sort of now published guidelines, and we are of course building that into the program as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And back to Seroquel, obviously there is some mix &#x2013; the issue &#x2013; I'm not going to get into the specifics, but obviously there has been some pricing impact along with the change between patients being on the &#x2013; the increase in use of the XR versus the IR and it's &#x2013; I think we are just going to see some difference here for a while, and I think part of that had to do with stocking, as much as anything relative to the product, but our whole promotional emphasis now is on the XR, and we're looking forward to getting the MDD but I'm not going to get into any more detail behind price and mix.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you. Regarding price, what was the price component of sales growth for the group in the quarter? Many companies in the sector talked about price effects of 3% and more than that. So I'd just like to know your figure there. Also, the other question on Nexium, what's your assumption for the reminder of the year particularly in the U.S.? You've been a bit cautious in terms of intensified competition. And then lastly on emerging markets, you now have a guidance with double-digit growth in constant exchange. What has been your assumption earlier? Is that a more positive one or is it simply unchanged? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll ask Simon maybe to comment on pricing components in the quarter, as well as Nexium. I think with emerging markets where we see some variation from quarter-to-quarter, obviously it's a bit slower in some of the markets right now, yet we see China's continuing to grow in the high 20s. I think emerging markets are a strategic issue for us. We're positioned well there; we're not trying to guide market-by-market. We lump them together and just try to give a sense of where we think it will be and we don't put a specific number around it. We've always said that within the aggregate, we expected mid single-digit sales performance across the group. So we don't guide by region. Simon, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay let me deal. You had three questions on pricing. One was sort of overall price impact on the growth for the half. I mean, outside of the U.S. we're not seeing price increases, it's net price decreases at various levels. We're able to achieve some net price increases on selected brands in the U.S. We focused on one of those a fair bit on this call, which is Seroquel. I might just come back to that in a moment. So short answer to your first question is no net price increases outside of the U.S., selected net price increases on a few brands in the U.S. The strong sales performance reflects very strong sales and marketing execution around the world in our key brands, and where we find in most of our markets and brands we are building share against the competition. And so that's the first point.</p>
          <p>Secondly, let me just touch on Seroquel just to be absolutely clear here. The growth in the U.S. on Seroquel of 22%, sort of 3 or 4 of that was on volume, the remainder was on a blend of net price increases, mix, and as I mentioned, this sort of managed market accrual adjustment; the vast majority of that is net price increase, the other two components are less than &#x2013; probably between a third and a half or so of that change.</p>
          <p>The final one was on Nexium, and our guidance for Nexium net pricing for the year has remained the same through the course of the year at high single-digits, and we've reaffirmed that guidance for this quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Going back to the emerging markets, looking at the basket of countries that you report as emerging rest of world, what is the growth in this quarter of those markets, so are you lose &#x2013; did you lose or gain share? And I was just reflecting, I think other people may have reflected this in their questions too that the rates you've reported as underlying growth in that basket of countries over the last five quarters have &#x2013; four of those quarters have been mid-to-high teens in the range of 15 to 20. We've dropped to 8. I just wondered whether there is a particular feature going on here? Is it really that volatile or is it for example a Crestor effect?</p>
          <p>The second question Simon, could you just give us an update on where you are with working capital improvements particularly inventories and your cash cycle?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just a point of clarification and forgive me for not knowing the answer to this, did Seroquel XR get approved for monotherapy in MDD in Canada and Australia?</p>

          <p>Okay. We'll come back to the third one in a minute. On the emerging markets and then I will let Simon pick up on that. I just &#x2013; when we look at the emerging markets at a regional level, so our data through the first three or four months of the year we had the fastest growing business in Latin America. I think we were third in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and we were second or third in Asia-Pacific in overall growth and the growth rates were in the double-digit range. So on a relative basis we are outperforming the markets.</p>
          <p>To your question, I don't think we're going to get into specific growth rates at a market by market level and in the second quarter there was clearly some slowing down of it compared to the first. On the other hand, I think when we look at the business and talk to our people there, while it will be different than where it was last year, I think we still see a pretty significant opportunity. Simon, do you want to pick up from there?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the headline is that we continue to see double-digit growth for the year. We recorded good growth in the first quarter for our emerging market, about 15%. We've had a couple of issues or a couple of factors that have led to a slightly for lower growth rate for this quarter. We pulled one out, mentioned it in our release, which is in Mexico, which is an important market, strong market for us in our emerging markets. We've had some impact from the swine flu there, we've also been making some changes to our distributor arrangements which led to some changes in the stocking cycle, and indeed we've actually been making some changes in distributor arrangements in a number of our emerging markets, we pulled out Mexico, but we are moving to some different arrangements in a number of the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So that's the first factor, some changes due to distribution arrangements in the course of this year. We have also had some favorable &#x2013; it was a favorable prior year compare, so we had a strong second quarter last time with some particular movement up in one or two markets. So I think the key to focus on is, we continue to see double-digit growth for our emerging markets; we remain pleased with our performance there. And I think David singled out China as being a market that continued to show strong growth, and if I look at the other markets around the business, we continue to see strong growth in Brazil, Russia, Turkey, all performing very strongly for us.</p>

          <p>Working capital, we are very focused as a company on not only delivering productivity improvement to what we deem to be sort of best external practice in all elements of our cost base, but also converting our sales and profits through into cash. We're working hard on working capital management across the cash cycle, and I think the area you pulled out Kevin, of inventory is definitely an area where we see we've made improvements, we are accelerating the inventory turn and we think we've got more that we can go for and that's a combination of the work we're doing on rationalizing the asset base, it's what we are doing in Lean improvements in each of our manufacturing plants and it's also an investment we are making in putting sort of end-to-end supply chain systems in place so we can really look at the total supply chain from end-to-end and optimize the inventory position. It's very much work in process. We've got more that we can go for.</p>

          <p>All right. One more question. I got it at 2:30. Steve Scala, let's do a quick one and we'll wrap up.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Actually I have three questions, but they are all brief. First, would AstraZeneca file Brilinta if the net clinical benefit were inferior to Prasugrel? I would think that if the net clinical benefit were inferior, the commercial potential might be too small to justify a filing. Secondly, how does AstraZeneca's PARP Inhibitor for triple negative breast cancer differ from Sanofi's PARP that is moving to Phase III? And then thirdly, assuming ONGLYZA is approved today, can you provide any color on the timing of launch, would be August or September? And the magnitude of the launch, is this going to be a massive launch whereby virtually every relevant U.S. doctor knows the message or a more narrow launch? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I can &#x2013; let me start with your third question on ONGLYZA. I mean, our plans for ONGLYZA are to go to market as quickly as we can, but we got to make sure everybody is up to speed, the label is up to-date, that we have promotional materials. We've got a significant primary care commitment plan for our overall organization in conjunction with the Bristol-Myers organization. So I don't know how to scale the magnitude other than to say to you we've got a very effective sales force that reaches a large number of primary care physicians who prescribe anti-diabetics and we expect to be talking to them about this one. I will have to look to Anders, I don't know whether there is a differentiation he is aware of with the PARP Inhibitor, any differentiation and will you comment on the Brilinta Prasugrel thing as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thanks David. I think that of around filing, we of course we file when we find that we have good opportunities to deliver sort of valuable medicines to patients and that's going be the driver for whatever we do. And I believe what you've seen on Brilinta meeting its primary sort of efficacy endpoint et cetera says we may have something for you there, so stay tuned. Around the PARP Inhibitor, I would say that it's still early days; I believe that we have a leading or we have the leading oral PARP Inhibitor. I think it's an extremely interesting class. As you know we showed some results at ASCO recently and it was sort of also featuring in some of the newspapers, so I think people are recognizing sort of the class and opportunities. As far as I know with only oral monotherapy opportunity right now, we are exploring it sort of aggressively within sort of breast and ovarian, and I think we have a leading position here. It's very hard to go into details versus the Sanofi in-license compound. So I would rather say interesting class, we made acquisition with KuDOS to get sort of a leading edge in here and we are exploring that right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks Steve, thank you Anders. And I would like to thank everybody, just remind &#x2013; we've had a very good strong first half financial performance, as I said with good operating performance. We see that at the brand level as well as at the regional level on the top line. We did get some help from some one-offs and we will always take it when we can and make sure that we distribute it properly and you saw our cost discipline is helping us to leverage our growth, expand our margins.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D side, we had some regulatory submissions, three in the first half and another one planned for the fourth quarter. So I think we are making good progress on the pipeline. And as a result of what we've done in the first half and our view of the second half, we've raised our core earnings per share target for the full year. So as you can see, we are committed to driving our business forward as quickly and efficiently as we can and making sure we bring good products to the market.</p>
          <p>With that, I will thank you all for your participation on the call today and say good day to everyone.</p>
