          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Annual Meeting on the 2009 Results, the Fourth Quarter of 2009 in particular and the Outlook. Meeting has changed its format a little this year. There will be a presentation that I will make together with our CFO for the financial parts of the results, which seems to be the right thing to do. And then, if you wish to ask questions, there will be active participation from the various divisional bosses. We thought that was the best thing to do on the basis of the feedback we got from last year's presentation and its format.</p>
          <p>The 2009 results are now known. I got the impression for the first time this year that they were known even before we came and presented them to you. And very clearly, there is a somewhat different view according to the school of thought you come from; &#x20AC;7.8 billion of net income for the whole of the year, down by 44% &#x2013; down by 47% compared to 2008 in dollars.</p>
          <p>And clearly I will come back to this, it's a significant fall, but that's of course part of our business, which is to manage a somewhat unstable and volatile environment. And that volatility is higher today than it has been in the past. But to others, the result is an excellent result. I heard on several occasions this morning, but it wasn't the analysts who used the word, but the generalists, I saw this morning the word 'comfortable'. And we shall explain to you this morning why it is both comfortable, but also very much down compared to last year. Let's have the first slide. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Well. First of all, the message I'd like to get across for 2009 is that 2009 of course is a year within a long-term strategy, with a strengthening of our upstream positions, but maintaining our positions in downstream and petrochemicals. That's our overall strategy.</p>
          <p>And in 2009 we've started to increase the diversity of our portfolio in our upstream business. We've started up five major projects. You are familiar with them. We started them up, and they're ramping up very nicely. Thank you. So we shall have the benefits in terms of increased output in 2010 more than was the case in 2009.</p>
          <p>As far as the North America is concerned, we've made significant additions to our portfolio there. We're not only talking about a maturity of our shale-based oil, we are also determined to participate in the unconventional gas market, particularly shale gas.</p>
          <p>In downstream, and the best way of gaining market share in downstream, it's necessary both to adapt our production base for refining and for petrochemicals to the environment, that's nothing new, even if there is quite a lot of criticism of that. And it's structural, and it's not just linked to the financial and economic crisis.</p>
          <p>And we also wish to integrate into our business development model, not only economic issues, not only our core business, but also sustainable development in the widest sense of sustainable development starting with energy efficiency, the fight against global warming, everything which makes an oil major an acceptable partner, even though people sometimes have difficulty in understanding why it's necessary to close down a refinery and at the same time ask us to reduce our greenhouse gases. But that's the contradiction we have to live with.</p>
          <p>On the slide, you have everything we've done this year, and all the projects that are developing very nicely. There are three major acquisitions at the end of the year, which we've now signed: Ahnet in Algeria, Chesapeake in shale gas in Texas. And also &#x2013; this is going back a little bit further, Cobalt in Deep Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and the final project almost is our participation in one of the giant fields that has been put up for development for Iraq. This is about 2 billion barrels of long-term oil equivalent. So that shows our determination to contribute proven reserves to our portfolio. And we need the determination to grow as a company as long as we maintain our financial position and our financial soundness, which of course has always been one of our major values.</p>
          <p>You will see the 2009 results on the slides later on, minus 47% in dollar terms in terms of net earnings, 13.4% ROIC, but return on equity of 16% which is higher than 15 during a period of crisis, is good.</p>
          <p>Investments maintained at about $18 billion. Our dividend &#x2013; and we'll come back to this, which is stable in euros, but up in dollars and the gearing ratio which remains very much within the range we've set, which is 25 to 30%. Even though with the acquisitions that we're in the process of finalizing, we will be closer to the 30% mark at the end of the year. But the main thing, of course, is to make good and profitable acquisitions. And of course, above all, the policy of cost cuts &#x2013; and although we see a slight recovery today, we have cut $2.2 billion out of our fixed costs in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our view of the economy has not fundamentally changed even if the &#x2013; even if there has been a big impact of the crisis on the price of gas and refining margins. Brent according to the method used has either fallen a lot or risen a lot. What is important for us is the average in 2009 compared to the average of 2008. And it's down from 100 to about 60.</p>
          <p>Although, from the 1st of January to the end of December, it moved up from 32 to 80, so you can do what you like with figures, but the fundamentals are that prices are down. The same is true, of course, even more so for the price of gas, where we have seen a complete decoupling between the price of oil and the price of gas. We'll come back to that later on.</p>
          <p>We think that could continue. There is of course two possible ways we could think about this, either that the price of gas will get closer to the price of oil and we don't think that's very likely at the moment, or the price of oil will fall towards the price of gas and for other reasons we don't believe that's very likely either given the market expectations and OPEC policy and geopolitical reasons.</p>
          <p>So clearly, the new element here which has had a pretty disastrous effect on our results, but it's had an even more disastrous effects on the results of our competitors is the collapse of our refining margins. Clearly, now there is a need for balance between supply and demand and we realized the way things were going. We anticipated this but quite clearly the economic crisis has accelerated their process.</p>
          <p>The margins are slightly higher now thanks to the hard winter we are having, but I don't think there's any reason to believe that this will last. So we'll come back to this in this presentation. We have to adapt our refining capacity and it's not just a problem in France but it's a problem within Europe, within the OECD countries. We're not very present in the U.S. in this respect, so others can perhaps say more about that than we can.</p>
          <p>Why do we believe that our strategy, which is based on a gradual rise in energy prices is the right strategy, quite apart from the effects of the current crisis? Well very clearly, as we have seen with the recovery of consumption in emerging economies, particularly China, demand is recovering in those countries and it's recovering more strongly than we thought. Will that last? We don't know, but it's clearly a strong recovery at the moment. In Europe and the United States, consumption is down, but in the 2009 to 2020 period, available capacity will be gradually dwindling.</p>
          <p>And we're talking here about capacity dwindling against a backdrop of a fairly stable situation and not taking account of any disruption of a geopolitical nature which may change things, particularly in terms of Iraq, Venezuela or other countries.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a bit optimistic to say that we can increase to 95,000 barrels per day, not because we don't have the technical capacity to do that, but because there are factors beyond our control, which may prevent us from doing that.</p>
          <p>But the reserves are there and what's important for us is to get our hands on those reserves when the capacity will be there or may not be there, so there is I think structural support for the price of crude oil. We've seen prices range from 60 to $80 per barrel, more recently between 70 and 80. Will the $70 support hold? I don't know.</p>
          <p>But I think recently, the fall in oil prices has been more to do with the fall in stock exchange equity markets and less to do with the underlying demand for oil. Gas, it's a similar situation, but the results are different and there is an excess of supply over demand at the moment, but the market is much more of a physical market. It's much less of a forward-looking market, like the oil market for reasons of organization, for reasons of what the partners in the gas market want.</p>
          <p>Even though in shale gas for the time being, the players in that market are looking at intelligent solutions to sell at the right price, but there is very clearly a bubble at the moment which is preventing prices from rising. Now Total is lucky enough to have a lot contracts which are linked to the oil price rather to the spot price. So we have managed to get fairly high prices compared to what demand would dictate.</p>
          <p>But we believe that the capacity will remain over-capacity for some time now. And we shall accommodate that. There is a debate about the size of the gas reserves in the U.S. I think we'll come back to this, as well. The figures that we've heard cover a very large range from very low figures to very high figures for the time being.</p>
          <p>We are a new player. And we will &#x2013; we shall therefore say that our deal is a good deal. And we shall see, as things proceed, how big the reserves are and how much we can actually extract from them.</p>
          <p>The new LNG production that we have is done at very competitive prices and therefore this has led to gas prices remaining at a fairly low level, but that's doesn't prevent in the medium term us anticipating a very strong rise in the demand for gas by 2020. And we shall see what the LNG provides and we may have to delay the bringing online of some projects, particularly in Africa, and there may well be a strong recovery in prices at some point in the future. That being said, when we launch the project today and you can see this is the case for Shtokman, we are talking about production in 2016 and 2017, not today.</p>
          <p>The gas we are extract &#x2013; we are selling today comes from reserves we found many years ago. So don't think &#x2013; look at things backwards and say that we should delay our new project simply because the prices today are low. Patrick?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As regards the results, let me remind how volatile the environment was in 2009. The average liquid price was down 36%, but Q4 to Q4 was actually up 44% which is good indication of how volatile prices were. Gas prices were also down 30% over the full year and interestingly, the refining margin indicator was down 65% at an average of $17 H per ton on the fourth quarter average of 11.7% which explains the net operating income in refining that I'll be commenting in just a few minutes. You'll also see that the euro and dollar pair has been roughly stable from 1.37 to 1.49 over the year as the total <mark type="inaudible" />. At 7.8 billion, income was down 44% as you've heard, adjusted net income in dollars, that was down 47%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to greater detail. Net operating income of the various sectors in 2009, $10.6 billion in total, with the major contribution, in fact, almost 85% of the total contribution from the upstream at $8.9 billion.</p>
          <p>In the downstream, the first quarter was quite positive. Downstream was net income of 1 billion for the full year and of course chemicals suffered of course with the general environment and only generated &#x20AC;400 million adjusted net income, particularly in chemical specialties.</p>
          <p>What we can say, if you look at the right hand side of the slide, what we can say is that Total has resisted very well by comparison with the other oil majors with the possible exception of BP. In fact, our upstream resisted much better than Exxon or Shell for instance. The same type of thinking can be said about the downstream; our downstream fared well relatively speaking by comparison with our main rivals.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the next slide, our balance sheet has a gain of 26% exactly at year-end. As out of which we can continue to invest and uphold our dividend with a certain degree of serenity. If you look at the figures for 2009, gross CapEx, that's the green bar on the right, that's gross CapEx of 18.6 billion, dividend of $7.6 billion &#x2013; all in dollars by the way &#x2013; funded through cash flow from operations to the tune of 17.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Divestments mainly concern Sanofi-Aventis shares but total divestments were 4.3 billion and net debt rose by $4.7 billion. That still leaves us with a very acceptable level of gearing at 26 to 27% at the end of 2009. As the Chairman said, in view of the acquisitions we have just made, we believe that we will be near &#x2013; towards the higher end of that 25 to 30% range for net debt to equity or gearing at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Very solid balance sheet and of course leaving us in a situation similar to the end of the 2008 where we can envisage the future with a certain degree of optimism and indeed a very real optimism, but as always in our case, measured optimism.</p>
          <p>Now, to talk more directly about our businesses, beginning with the upstream, the portfolio is, as I mentioned earlier on, is or has been, should I say, strengthened on the whole. We will be looking at a number of projects that started up in 2009 and that are now showing just how much potential they have, but that is good news, of course, thanks to the number of projects we have been working on for number of years.</p>
          <p>But we have new projects due to be launched in 2010; five major projects, in fact, which we have taken the FID or final investment decision. Quite clearly, we must continue to build up new reserves and of course we have three new projects that should boost our reserves by close to 1 billion barrels spanning through projects, as I said, a very significant increase in our reserves.</p>
          <p>Now we will continue to take a considered and measured approach to cost reduction. We know that there is a general tendency for costs to increase. There is a lot of demand for high-tech projects in oil and indeed in petrochemicals as well. So, more than ever before, we must take a disciplined approach to cost control and show we have operational excellence while continuing to invest. The stop-and-go policy, as we have seen in the past, is a policy that doesn't work.</p>
          <p>Now we limited the commitments we have made in the past. We used to have investments in the region of 20 billion and more, but you will see that now preparing our future, we have kept this within the budget, which is usually in the range of $18 billion. We say when we talk about reserves and resources, but this keeps our reserves MP-1 and MP-2 at a significant level and certainly enables that we can continue to increase our production with a little more optimism than we have done so up to now.</p>
          <p>Now our performance in 2009 was down. If we compare our production in 2009 with the previous year, our production was down. That said, there are security issues in Nigeria, there's the OPEC effect. These are issues that have an impact; the underlying growth is what really generates cash for the group. Underlying growth was 2% even in a difficult year. We started a number projects even though they are not fully on-stream yet.</p>
          <p>As for the underlying growth, you can see that these are projects that probably have the merit of existing, they already have a positive impact on our results. In fact, a greater impact than the increase in production, so in other words these are accretive. This is production that is actually adding value, enhancing our earnings per share.</p>
          <p>With the net adjusted net operating income of close to 9 billion in 2009, you'll see how we fare by comparison with the other oil majors. We have been more resilient than most of our main rivals, with the exception of British Petroleum. We have, however, performed considerably better than most of our competitors.</p>
          <p>This is all relative and in barrel terms, the situation is just as interesting because our margin in 2009 was almost $11 per barrel, which is very close to Exxon's margin and indeed much higher than the margins of our other competitors.</p>
          <p>And the five major projects started up, you know them by heart, you know them all well. The good news is that they're almost in all full production. I don't know that's fully the case in Akpo. Louis? Correct? Has the ramp-up been completed yet? Yes? Tahiti is working well in the Gulf of Mexico. Tombua Landana in Angola, as well, and our two LNG projects on the right hand side which have made us a leader in the LNG market. These are projects that were launched at a time when costs were much lower than they are today, giving us a very obvious competitive edge. We're particularly proud of the Yemen LNG project because this was, well, quite an adventure, over and beyond the figures that you see here.</p>
          <p>Now, as was the case when we compared income with production, these are projects that are not just sensitive to oil prices between 60 and $80 a barrel, these are projects that increase that are very much energy price sensitive.</p>
          <p>Now for the same reasons, we said part of this concerns gas and the other part concerns oil, isn't that correct? These are the two price scenarios, aren't they? Yes. Production was approximately 240 million barrels per day, all five projects combined.</p>
          <p>If you take a closer look at the figures here, the reserve base, and you will see from one year to the next we had a number of new contributors and of course is the change in the scope of consolidation and price effects which are already secondary, but the overall increase is 103% with a life span of over 12 years. The variation is not very significant by comparison with 2008.</p>
          <p>Just a few words about positioning in geographical location and of course the technology used as well. Since 2004, we have found that the geographical breakdown has changed. Middle East has increased, the Americas are also on the up, Europe quite naturally has seen its reserves decline and of course Africa is very stable. As for the technologies applied, the Deep Offshore hasn't changed an awful lot in terms of reserves, heavy oil is up, LNG is up as well.</p>
          <p>Unconventional gas, well, you need a magnifying glass to see the actual contribution but the advantage is this is something new in 2009, so a big increase by comparison with the previous level of zero. Gas largely unchanged for similar reasons to the ones I mentioned earlier on and hydrocarbon liquids down quite sharply. As for the breakdown by country, OECD or non-OECD, very little change by comparison with the previous years.</p>
          <p>Operating costs, well we can at least talk about ours, if not those of our competitors because at this point in time, they haven't published their figures. Importantly, up to last year, our operating expenses and technical costs were lower than those of our competitors. However, we have to acknowledge that our increase curve was somewhat sharper than that of our rivals. At least, last year the technical costs stabilized. As for how the other majors will fare, we don't know, but we suspect, in fact we strongly suspect that we will remain competitive, again comparatively speaking.</p>
          <p>Just for the pleasure of it, I would like to pay tribute to the people in exploration and production because the total operating expenses were reduced by 13% whereas assets operated by third parties were only reduced by 3%. I will leave you to deduce what you like but time-to-time we do like to say we are the best. In fact, if not ourselves, we like to hear other people say it. And though our partners are reducing their costs, they obviously do so on projects in which we are not involved.</p>
          <p>What about the five major projects we'll be launching this year in 2010? Well, they will be production and you are familiar with them all of course as well but this year we have decided to launch them. Of course we have the Surmont Phase 2 with Conoco Philips in Alaska and the CLOV, or CLOV project, which is the fourth hub of Angola's Block 17, We've got Tormore in the West of Shetlands. I might say that we and it's worth mentioning obtained special tax benefits from the British Government, thanks to which we were able to launch this project with a greater peace of mind than would have been the case otherwise and this is a gas project.</p>
          <p>And it was important to ensure that even at low prices, this project would continue to be viable. Now we have two projects in Nigeria as well, that will help develop a second hub in Egina and Ofon II, which will be one of our more traditional type assets again in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>I am not going to comment to slides on Surmont and CLOV but they're well worth dwelling upon because it's in these two projects that we succeeded in maintaining or even reducing our costs. We will nonetheless be investing $14 billion in the upstream in 2010 as CapEx projects.</p>
          <p>Now, the resource space, this is a building up to FIDs. As you know we've made a number of efforts to bring in a number of exploration permits. There's also the need to bolster our appraisal work on existing wells. And there are a number of acquisitions of the third type, as they are known, EXCO, the Abu Dhabi extension, which is particularly interesting as it's a premiere, I would say, a first. It's not so much the Gasco number as the processing of associated gas with the production of oil onshore.</p>
          <p>Now all this has led us to continue our efforts in exploration. We've earmarked $1.8 billion approximately for 2010 on a number of targeted projects. And this budget is well-spread over the globe, 64% operated by Total, which is a figure that's on the increase. In the past, it was in the region of 50, 55%, and of course exploration/production clearly warrants this level of commitment; the 2009 situation yielded an additional 750 million barrels.</p>
          <p>Our GSO network manager here Marc, would tell you that even though we are careful about our cash flow at the moment, if you have new ideas, well, the figure of 1.8 billion isn't engraved in marble.</p>
          <p>As for medium-term projects, this is between the final investment decision and the arrival of new resources, particularly with a view to preparing the period for 2011 to 2014. Our start-ups mainly involve projects that have, by definition, been launched, or are being acquired. Barnett Shale is in Chesapeake Bay. We will be beginning production with the $30,000 &#x2013; 30,000 barrels a day. As for the third hub before CLOV and Block 17 in Angola. These are projects that we will be starting up before 2014.</p>
          <p>The less certain of these is the last mentioned, not necessarily meaningful, but Tempa Rossa as when I spoke with the Head of Exploration and Production, it's a project that could be postponed from one year to the following year, anyway a pity because it's a very, very attractive project. Now we have a number of partnerships, Chesapeake, of course, which drew our minds, or who to our minds are the experts in the development of shale oil and gas in the U.S. This could be the starting point of a very interesting adventure.</p>
          <p>After a number of years of &#x2013; a number of lean years, this could be the opportunity to recommence with Algeria. Halfaya was fairly successful, the only disappointment when we like to look at it, but this is in Iraq as you know and in Russia &#x2013; well above and beyond the major projects Shtokman we're continuing to seek out development opportunities particularly in gas with partners such as Termokarstovoye who is with Novatek.</p>
          <p>In North America, we have a number of positions we are developing. First of all, in heavy oils, now those are taking longer than initially anticipated. We are looking at 17 with ConocoPhillips, obviously we are working on Joslyn which is an oil field for which we expect the FID in 2011. I'm not going to review them all in detail. But we are still very eager to continue to expand our presence in the U.S. be it unconventional hydrocarbons or tight gas. And when necessary with the support of partners and allies who certainly have greater expertise than we have in certain areas whence the somewhat unusual joint venture that we have entered into with Cobalt with a view to exploring the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the deep offshore sector.</p>
          <p>Our long term growth sectors now, one you will hear, the rest you are familiar with. The deep offshore, this is of course one of the Group's unique specialties, where we're acknowledged not just as operators but where we are also acclaimed in view of our ability to keep our promises even to increase the plateaus. We are also well-versed in new challenges because we at last have an opportunity to develop a new hub in Block 32. But we had quite a number of problems within the &#x2013; this is a project that we should be able to put before the Executive Committee very soon.</p>
          <p>Heavy oil, you are familiar with. This is not a gas project of course, but that's really for the long term and of course we will be resuming with unconventional gas with the Barnett Shale in the U.S., also in Algeria. LNG, I will develop for a few seconds, not just a number of new projects, but a number of future projects as well, I talked to you about.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the usual slide. Despite the need to tell you whether we've switched one line from one part of another to the presentation, I'll let you look into that, it usually gives rise to quite a number of questions and indeed I see a number of people smirking or smiling already. These projects exist; they're there in front of you. They may not be all as advanced, at some stage of advancement.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, our production prospects for the period between 2009 and 2014 we've promised that our average production of the period will increase by an annual 2%, despite the decline &#x2013; that's a similar decline to last year, approximately 5% per annum on average. Factor that in with the price of crude oil, and you see that a number of projects that are near the end production and that we will have to make a number of acquisitions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me move on to LNG, which is something I can go through fairly quickly because this confirms the strategy that we have initiated and which is working well. We have now become, I've been told, number two in LNG in 2010. But that's fine, but it's not necessarily where we are in the rankings, it's what we can produce in terms profits and cash for the company.</p>
          <p>Two major projects here: Yemen LNG which awaits the second train for 2010, but with a very low breakeven point, which makes it possible to trade gas in London. And to get the best possible outlets for our gas sales to optimize our sales and you can see that sales of LNG are expected to develop very strongly and purchases, too, clearly, so that we can maintain our positions on this market, which is an important market, which even though it seems to be a bit bubbly at the moment, should enable us to improve our return on investment and recover cents and dollars for millions of BTUs, so as to make these projects as profitable as they were proposed last year. These are results of LNG, as you can see they are very creditable, which is basically what's on this slide. So I shan't repeat it for the projects that we have; they've made a contribution of $3 billion to the net operating income of the Total Group in 2009. Yemen LNG and Qatargas, Train 5, it's Train 2 of Qatargas, 2, but it's ours.</p>
          <p>And we are looking at new projects over and beyond Angola LNG, which is currently being developed. And Ichthys and Shtokman, we are finalizing studies on and we have new projects for the future, like in Africa, even though we know of course that security is not something that we can chose to ignore. And it doesn't make our life any easier.</p>
          <p>Developing complementary energies, we started this drive last year. It's the result of our vision on supply and demand in the long term, in spite of the fact that, because in view of the fall in demand, but a fall in production capacity, we feel that there will be not enough fossil energy to meet global demand, and we want therefore to look at how we can be involved in developing new complementary energies, which make it possible for us to meet our commitments in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p>In solar, here you have precise examples of what we are doing, so it's not just words, it's action. We have started a number of partnerships, more in research and development &#x2013; than development. But as technology is developing very quickly, we take time to decide on the larger projects. Biomass is an important issue for an oil major like Total, and we also are involved in a number of private projects there.</p>
          <p>And the nuclear venture of course, which has of course had a small setback with Abu Dhabi. But that doesn't prevent us from thinking about equivalent developments in an area which is not really our core business, but which is for us a new energy. And we have basically the same view for 2030, 70% of fossil energy is to meet global demand in 2030.</p>
          <p>Let me try and speed up bit, downstream now. The economic environment here, as you know, is not good, and when people say it's been profoundly changed, it's more due to an acceleration through the economic crisis, rather than any underlying change in the structural elements of this market that we were expecting anyway. This has led to the economic crisis has accelerated. The fall in demand in the OECD world, whereas developing and emerging economies in Asia or the Middle East have increased their capacity.</p>
          <p>So clearly there is an excess capacity in the OECD area that has affected the whole of the industry. We saw in the results earlier on that the Anglo companies, Anglo-Saxon companies have been impacted far more than we have. American refining margins have also taken a deep hit. And therefore it's not just a French problem that some people tend to think, it's a far more general problem.</p>
          <p>And that we must therefore deal with the much more generally with thinking about possible sales and possible closures. But it's clear that we can't be a leader on a market. And not to show the responsibilities that that leadership requires. Even as I said last year, sales do make it possible to reduce our exposure even if that doesn't have a direct impact on the overall situation. But it's important that we sell and multiply by the margin to make our money.</p>
          <p>And when do we see a return to positive refining margins? And I think the answer is, if there is not closure in Europe and Western world, then there is not much hope that with the hard winter we having at the moment, both in Europe and the U.S., with the exception perhaps of North America in Vancouver, there will be a slight improvement in our margins, but we can't say that, okay, that's the end of it, we can turn over the page and pretend that nothing's happened &#x2013; no, far from it.</p>
          <p>We must adapt our production base to the current structural environment and that's what we intend to do with a reduction from 2007 to 2011 of 500 barrels per day of capacity, that's about 20% of our global capacity, with nevertheless capital spending which is down, but nevertheless significant for the continuing part of our operations.</p>
          <p>We do not intend to truck with either security or the environment. So from 2009 to 2015 you will see that it's about $2 billion per year that we shall be investing in order to maintain our production base in the proper condition. And then there is nevertheless growth and further profitability.</p>
          <p>The investment in Port Arthur is now behind us and of course there is Jubail which is up and coming, but thanks to the leveraged financing has a much less significant impact on our CapEx, but clearly we have to continue our efforts.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing, we must make a few points about this because one of the reasons why the refining and marketing results of Total stands up pretty well in comparison with our major competitors is that our marketing is &#x2013; given its positioning and its size, produces results which are pretty satisfactory, even more than a little satisfactory, I would say.</p>
          <p>The CapEx and the capital employed is not enormous. So &#x2013; but the results are nevertheless there and we intend to keep it that way, because we can't just sit and do nothing. And so we have decided therefore to merge our efforts with ERG in Italy. It won't simply be Total anymore of course, but Total-ERG should be stronger than Total and ERG individually and that will be the case. On these markets, we have to fight to keep our positions and if we do that then we shall continue to maintain these good results.</p>
          <p>Chemicals now. It's been a difficult year. Patrick has talked about that, I don't particularly want to dwell on it. Clearly, at the end of last year there was a strong recovery in emerging markets and this contributed to an improvement at the end of the year and at the beginning of 2010. By the way, that being said, 2009 as a whole was not a good year, in spite of the tremendous determination of our people to reduce costs and it's important that to we continue to do that and that we continue to make sure that we are able to have good business in emerging markets, in growing markets, where we have lower prices for our feedstock and where we can meet our competitors better than with NAFTA.</p>
          <p>So we are continuing our policy here, and I think the policy is well known. We still have to conclude some of this restructuring particularly in Europe and we have to derive the benefit from our growth operations in emerging countries, including the Middle East, although, I can't really describe the Middle East and as an emerging part of the world. On the right hand side of the slide, you will have seen quite apart from other things, how we see things in this area &#x2013; in areas of growth, Middle East and Asia, $700 million by 2015, that's suggested net operating income by 2015, $700 million. That's the result of what Fran&#xE7;ois Corn&#xE9;lis and his people have been doing over the past five years.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at specialty chemicals, because I don't think enough is said about them. What we wanted to do this year, last year rather was to show that by being responsive, we could resist in very competitive markets, markets which are basically B2C markets.</p>
          <p>ROACE close to 10% despite the crisis and that I think is something which is very critical. Now you may say that 10% is not as good as 13. Sure, I can count too, but we are not talking about the same industry, we are not talking about the same risks, we are not talking about the same businesses that were necessarily going to keep forever. But I don't think that it should be ignored either. There is here a considerable amount of flexibility and potential for the future growth of the company. What about the outlook then?</p>
          <p>Sustainable development integrated to our projects, as I said initially, it's very clear that we have decided in a very determined way to include sustainable development within our business model and to do that for the Analysts' presentation, as well as for the other presentations. Sustainable development governance will be involved in all of our projects. We shall be looking very closely at energy efficiency, we'll be looking at reducing greenhouse gas submission, will be looking at our attitude towards local populations and the local authorities. We shall basically be trying to be more acceptable to all the stakeholders while continuing to grow our business. It's not always easy to do that. And so it's not easy for people to realize that we are changing.</p>
          <p>In Yemen, for instance, we are particularly keen on environment and training. In Angola, we are involved in Angolisation, and clearly we need to find new methods for trapping &#x2013; capturing CO2 and we need as we are doing to look at clean energies like Solar in Abu Dhabi for instance, not only to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also when we're talking about new energies to develop those new energies in line with our sustainable development philosophy.</p>
          <p>What about coal, some people say. Well, without &#x2013; the lack &#x2013; capturing product, there is no point in getting involved in coal and so we shall have to until we see what that project will contribute. The continuing investment program, as Patrick was saying earlier on, is the underlying basis of our policy, 18 billion in 2009, 18 billion CapEx in 2010, perhaps it's not quite comparable because in 2010, we won't have the acquisitions that we had in 2009.</p>
          <p>But clearly, we are making an extra effort in upstream and we &#x2013; less of an effort in chemicals and downstream particularly. Chemicals have been reduced in previous years as you know. So we must continue to invest, we will continue to invest, but with our disciplined investment process, more selective, projects which will really create value for the company.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet of the company, Patrick referred to earlier on, I won't dwell on this now. The Board, which met yesterday, has decided to ask the shareholders' meeting to be held in May to approve a stable dividend, &#x20AC;2.28 and that of course because of the currency parities will be higher in dollar and we shall maintain our investment and clearly that is compatible with our strong dividend policy.</p>
          <p>And you have the information here which can enable you to do the sensitivity calculations. We believe that 2010 is something that we can look to with reasonable optimism on the basis of the scenarios we are looking at and with the coming online of new production facilities.</p>
          <p>To conclude, our key strengths. People often ask us, what's the difference between our company and the other majors? Well, I think, a lot of things, basically. Particularly in terms of the position in the oil market, I think our sustainable development philosophy is something that is now very much in the heart of our business and must be taken seriously by everyone.</p>
          <p>The ability to form partnerships, not only for the fun of it but the need to form partnerships where access to resources is becoming more difficult and we must continue to have that policy of partnerships. And I think it is one of our specificities. We do have recognized expertise in major project management. You saw that earlier on for the projects we've just launched and the projects we are going to launch, and are preparing, everything to do with high technology. I think our recognized expertise is a plus point for this company. And we also I think have one other specificity, even though Exxon is not far from us. I don't know who is copying who, but we are a company which maintains its determination to be an integrated company, improving the competitiveness of its Downstream and Chemicals business.</p>
          <p>Clearly it is upstream, which is most important to us, but downstream and chemicals are an integral part of what we believe is necessary to continue to grow the business with developing countries, partners with us and remaining competitive. These are businesses which must and remain profitable and not simply add a little to the company, and clearly we will continue to strengthen our competitiveness both in petrochemicals and in downstream and particularly in refining.</p>
          <p>So that brings me to the end of my presentation of the 2009 results and the outlook for 2010. I believe that this &#x2013; the outlook is encouraging. The 2009 results are down quite considerably, but we mustn't forget that we've managed to resist in a difficult market, set of markets, and that enables us to look to the future with measured optimism.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dominique Patry from Cheuvreux. I have three questions. First of all, last September you told us that your decline rate had been increased by the delay in starting up certain projects. Well, in view of the fact that your projects are in the ramp-up phase and the ramp-up is going well, these are already in production, the same causes produce the same effects, could we expect the decline trend to be reversed in future years?</p>
          <p>Second, I have a question about your dividend policy. Your volume of production would be increased and you said this would be accretive, your costs are well-contained, what about your dividend policy in euros, please?</p>
          <p>My third question concerns Ichthys. Apparently the FID will be in 2011. Now, in Australia, a number of projects that have already started up, what about your ability to meet deadlines and to contain costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves-Louis Darricarr&#xE8;re, concerning the decline, would you like to that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I am going to answer questions one and three together. Of course your first question was about the start-up of new projects and of course projects that are ramping up satisfactorily, will this halt the decline rate of 5% per annum? Well, no, the decline rate concerns fields that already in production.</p>
          <p>Now when you reason over a number of years, we also anticipate production starts-ups, but it's true that when an oil field starts production, there is a ramp up and then of course a decline is lessened. And of course, the more of that you have in your production mix, the lesser decline you have. But we have no reason to change the forecasted decline rate of 5% per annum and that will be offset by the increase in the production volume. The new projects will, of course, compensate a certain part of that decline.</p>
          <p>Your third question concerned to Ichthys, yes the Ichthys project. Well, the final investment decision will be taken in 2011, so we're in the engineering phase, FEED phase. We know how difficult it is to get projects started up in Australia particularly on time and within the budget. Well, as our engineering studies stand, we still &#x2013; we're still aiming at that same deadline and we won't be starting up production before something like 2017. So yes, I can't say a lot more at this point in time but that's the whole purpose of the engineering studies that our currently underway.</p>
          <p>That's the whole purpose and goal of those studies. I have no reason to believe that we will not achieve those targets. We said this last time around but we &#x2013; I had good news that led to also its complications. In other words, the reserves were higher than expected, particularly with more condensates than initially anticipated, as a result of which we had to review the project and reconfigure it.</p>
          <p>Of course that's the good news, the less good news is that it's a &#x2013; well, the project is dearer and will take longer to &#x2013; well nonetheless we've begun the FEED phase last year, which is why, which is the reason for the delay. That said, the trend is unchanged and I have no other news at this point.</p>
          <p>The dividend policy, right, regarding the dividend policy, let me begin by reminding you that this year, we have maintained the dividend unchanged at &#x20AC;2.28, which is an increase in dollars, meaning that we compare rather favorably with our competitors. The payout ratio is 66% this year, and as you know, the overall goal underpinning our policy is obviously in a stabilized environment, but no such thing exists of course, or aiming at an average payout ratio of 50%.</p>
          <p>Do bear in mind, our gearing is very modest at 26%, but our cash reserves, particularly with our stake in Sanofi, leaves us very comfortable for at least two years if not more. So over the next few years, we are confident about upholding our sustained CapEx policy and indeed a continued dividend policy.</p>
          <p>By the way, remember that refining margins are low now, as indeed are crude oil prices and we can still maintain our dividend despite those adverse factors. I think that policy was very clearly explained in the press release we put out this morning, press release which was of course approved by the Board of Directors yesterday.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Aymeric de Villaret from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. You stressed to the merits of being an integrated company in downstream, upstream and chemicals. Could you say a few words about what's happened in Uganda? And the pre-emption of course of Total and mainly Total, but Exxon as well had been criticized for venturing into Uganda. What could you say about CMPC? Secondly is regards distribution. Statoil is being &#x2013; is being floated. Any comment on that at a European level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first part of your question. Regarding Uganda, it is no mystery by the fact that we are having talks with the Tullow and the operator has preempted the deal and now has full ownership of the blocs existing in Uganda which cover a very high percentage of the Total surface area and nothing more I can say at this point in time but this is an opportunity for Total to venture into a new part of Africa. Well, we have position that has been well recognized. Michel, would you like to answer the part of the question concerning distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you're an integrated company you should provide seamless, fully integrated service. Not just produce molecules, make them into a form that can be consumed and even deliver them into where people want them. That's called distribution. That's called marketing, which is the final link in the hydrocarbon chain.</p>
          <p>It so happens that we at Total have been doing this for a very, very long time. And as evidenced by our results, we have been doing this with consistency and talent and that doesn't mean that we are static. We, too, move with our environment and depending on the signals sent to us by our customers, a little more of this, a little less of that, and every month, something new crops up.</p>
          <p>And BP's disposal of its filling stations in France is something that I think has to be put into perspective. They have 400 filling stations admittedly in France. Now we are here in Paris, and I imagine most of you here today this morning are here in Paris and are probably closer to the ground here in Paris and well, okay, BP has 400 filling stations. We have 17,000. Fine. BP is selling out, sure. Maybe that suggests that BP intends to discontinue its refining business in France. Maybe BP doesn't see the point of being integrated for them in France. But I think that's really a question that should be put to BP directly.</p>
          <p>As for Total, well our network of filling stations is vibrant, doing well. We open and close filling stations every week. Likewise, with the whole commercial chain be it in lubricants, LPG, specialty products and quite naturally in the most of visible part of the final link that is our filling stations. So, we are actively providing the service that our customers expect of us, and we are keeping a very close watch on customer satisfaction surveys.</p>
          <p>We manage our portfolio of filling stations in such a way that we are as aligned as best we can with our customers' requirements, making us European and African leaders. I guess in other words that, yes, we &#x2013; our policy is that of a &#x2013; strategy is that of a &#x2013; an integrated oil company. But, that said some 70% of our business is in the upstream, 18 in downstream and 12% in chemicals, just to give you some idea of the breakdown. I've just said  &#x2013; let me give you an idea of how advantageous it is to be an integrated group. Uganda is one thing, Angola is another, but in Uganda we have network. In fact, we slightly increased it recently by buying out Chevron's stake.</p>
          <p>Obviously, being involved in marketing in Uganda helps us increase our share of production. The fact that you have a network gives you know-how or knowledge, and it's always helpful in cooperating with countries that we'd been involved in the downstream and marketing as in the case in Uganda, which is a small example of how being an integrated group helps us to develop sustainable business.</p>
          <p>On that our market share in Uganda is just above the 20% mark. Everybody in Uganda knows the Total brand, our red and white colored filling stations. Our subsidiary, Total Uganda, was established back in 1966, so quite some time. The Head of our Marketing and Refining is very proud of what we do in Uganda.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bertrand Hod&#xE9;e from Kepler. Three questions. You've reduced the unit costs of your E&amp;P expenses by 8%. I'd like to know what the contribution of currency transition was in that and what would be &#x2013; trend be factoring out currency translation? What the trend will be in 2010?</p>
          <p>And my second question regarding CLOV on slide 11, for instance you had shown the breakdown of the cost reduction since the peak of July 2008. Does that mean that you are happy with the bids you received and that the launch is forthcoming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning your first question, the contribution of exchange rates was considerable, in fact sometimes 60%. So it's not just a proactive approach on our part, that's certainly a role of &#x2013; exchange rates does play a part. As regards costs, you see the statistics for instance that show that the costs are picking up. This is what we feared, in fact we mentioned this last year that the downturn wasn't as sharp as we expected, and we were afraid that the pick-up will be sharper and sooner than we wanted.</p>
          <p>That said, it's important to be profitable with the prices being as they are, but with all the new technologies we have, with all the progress we've made in environmental safety and so on, we have fewer and fewer companies capable of providing the level of services we require. So there is less competition among suppliers. But a lot of projects starting up, and clearly with the exception of very conventional fields and &#x2013; costs elsewhere are on the rise, very clearly. It's up to us to be careful that, as in the past, be careful to be &#x2013; very important to be sure that technical costs do not overheat, as was the case in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves-Louis, would you like to add a word about CLOV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not much I can add about CLOV &#x2013; CLOV, because we are currently processing the bids we've received. In fact, we have a lot more information than I would have liked. I'm not going to disclose anything confidential, but as you know, contracts are awarded, but before that, they must be approved by the authorities, and that's where we are right now. So I would be very careful not to tell you whether we are satisfied or not with the bids we have. CLOV is one of the FIDs we want to take in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Well, as for being satisfied, everything's always too costly. But do I think we will launch this project? The answer is yes, I do believe we will. But you can't really say to the authorities that you want to launch the project and then not go ahead with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Charles Lacoste from Cheuvreux. What investments have you planned for Halfaya and what about the forecast projects, CapEx rather the 18 billion you planned for 2010? Or how much CapEx have you earmarked? And what kind of profitability do you expect from Halfaya?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Halfaya, well the contract we've signed includes a Phase up to the middle of the year. Phase &#x2013; gradual build-up before everything comes into effect. Then we &#x2013; of course we have the design stage, or pre-FEED if you like, then the FEED stage, front-end engineering and design. Then in the 2010 budget we have included a number of studies.</p>
          <p>That said, under the terms of the contract, as is standard with second and even first bidding round contracts, the plan is to reach a production plateau of 530,000 barrels per day before 2016, unless I'm mistaken. Yes, 2016. So we're really in the very embryonic stage of this project.</p>
          <p>As for the expected profitability or expected yield, well, one of the reasons that we acquired the stake in Halfaya alongside our Chinese partners and we didn't get one for CNOOC is that the remuneration we proposed &#x2013; remember there were only two figures in the bid. First of all, what remuneration we would accept per barrel and the production plateau we expected to reach by 2016. That's all there was in the bid, two figures. The rest was just pure arithmetic. Obviously, with the weighting system coefficients, so we chose to submit bids that were maybe border-line, but nonetheless in keeping with our own profitability criteria. So I think it's too early to say. Let's wait and see the outcome of the engineering studies. Maybe just to add to what Yves-Louis Darricarr&#xE8;re has said, at this point in time, we're looking at $600 million; that's our stake over the five-year period.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, a substantial amount but not an awful lot on an annual basis. The other comment and the only other comment I will make is that we accepted the terms and conditions because we were not operators. I don't mind &#x2013; don't mind making other comments, but not here; not on the record. Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Henri Gauvatier. I'd like to ask you a question about nuclear power. You and the public authorities have launched a survey into the nuclear energy. Now, Total, how is it interested in nuclear power that's been expressed on the number of occasions? And it would appear now that you are interested in acquiring a stake in a nuclear power plant. Now, it could well be that the fuel part would be separate from the design and construction part. What are your thoughts on the nuclear power sector in France and what can conclusions can you draw from the negative outcome in Abu Dhabi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before giving the floor to Philippe Boisseau, let me simply say that we're currently talking with the person appointed by President of the Republic. We're currently considering shall we say working on what has to be called the Abu Dhabi postmortem and second part of his assignment is to consider how the French nuclear sector could be reorganized.</p>
          <p>So I'm obviously not going to answer your second question by definition. We will reserve our position for the committee. And secondly, it's important to understand that as far as Total is concerned, we are not equipment providers or nuclear power plant builders. We are major project managers; admittedly with acknowledged expertise because we have to know what we're doing.</p>
          <p>It's been explained time and again, Areva has nothing to do with Total. The way EDS projects in France have nothing to do with the way we manage our projects. We work with Halliburton, Technip, CPM and others. We operate &#x2013; sometimes aren't operators, but we are not &#x2013; and that's something I insist on stressing because there tends to be confusion between what we do at Total and the nuclear power sector.</p>
          <p>What we've said is that, our potential involvement in the nuclear power plant is not something very different than what we would do in the power, the oil business. We are not going to be integrated in the nuclear sector. We do not intend to be integrated or become builders or whatever in the nuclear power sector. Philippe Boisseau, maybe you would like to say few words about the Korean, successful Korean bid in Abu Dhabi?</p>

          <p>Well, as I think you've given the essential part of the answer, let me say a few words about what I'll call the Abu Dhabi adventure. We submitted a bid. Of course, Abu Dhabi selected the Korean bid, there's not an awful lot that can be added to that. I think it's all been said already; our bid didn't really &#x2013; wasn't really what the Abu Dhabi authorities wanted. Well, as Christophe has said, our strategy is a long-term strategy. We will not be going it alone, so we're looking into possible partnerships.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, the first phase we'll embark upon is the project we're working on which is the Penly project. The Penly project, that's the 8.33% that will be an initial experience. Then we look at the various opportunities that arise, so I think it's too early to be drawing any conclusions at this point in time.</p>

          <p>One final question, possibly? Because time is moving on.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. On page 20, when you talk about the development of low CO2-emitting energies for the future, this is of course taking up the Energy Challenge. When I look at the different proposals, what I see is that coal plays actually quite an important part in the additional energy used here, so I'd be interested in knowing what's new in terms of CO2 capture or sequestration in &#x2013; particularly with coal. I know it's a major issue, but if you were to develop coal as an additional energy, this would of course require technological prowess in CO2 capture.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is a &#x2013; my answer's very much what I've said about the Lacq CO2 capture and storage pilot tests. I have said, you know, if we need to comply with greenhouse gas emissions standards, we will not be able to do so with coal. We want to avoid emissions as high as with the coal to liquids approach, but Philippe, maybe you'd like to say a few words about what we're doing in research in this area to reduce, or &#x2013; yes, to reduce emissions?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We decided that we'd only develop coal ventures when it could be done in a clean way and of course there are several stages involved here. The first stage consists of optimizing coal transformation. We have research ongoing in a number of divisions in the group concerning gasification of coal or transformation of coal to liquids.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have a number of pilot tests going on, Lacq being the case in point regarding CO2 capture and storage, but there are other CO2 projects ongoing in France, indeed, as well in the world in the field of research, particular regarding CO2 capture in discontinued coal mines or even in deep aquifers because this is where we believe there is the greatest storage availabilities are to be found. So at this juncture, or either in research or optimizing processes, and when you look at the costs, at current levels, coal would not be profitable, certainly not on a mature industrial scale before the end of the decade.</p>
          <p>I'm aware that there are any doubts, I'm sure, but on this particular slide on page 20, we are talking about the world and not just Total. The day we have 330 million barrels a year, well, even we would be the king of oil and this is obviously the global energy mix as expected by 2030.</p>

          <p>Now, as Philippe Boisseau has just said, as long as we haven't got a solution, we will not be anymore involved in coal than we are now. We will keep our coal activity in South Africa, commercial involvement, just to keep our hand in, technologically speaking. We may need that technology at some point in time, but this may be a very important part &#x2013; coal may play a very important part in global energy requirements in the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That brings our meeting to a close. We can step outside for cocktail, if you wish. Thank you.</p>
