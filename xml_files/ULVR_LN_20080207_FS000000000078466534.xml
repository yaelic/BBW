          <p>Good morning everyone and welcome to Unilever's Quarter Four and Full Year 2007 Results Presentation. I'm joined this morning by Jim Lawrence, our new Chief Financial Officer and by John Rothenberg, our Senior VP for Investor Relation. And in the audience, Vindi Banga, who is our President Foods; Ralph Kugler, who is our President HPC; also Harish Manwani who is in charge of Asia, Africa, Middle East and Turkey; and Dave Lewis, who is the head of our business in the UK.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to draw your attention to the disclaimer relating to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. The disclaimer is included here and will be posted with the text of this presentation on Unilever's website. In a moment, Jim will take you through the details of the results for the year.</p>
          <p>The starting point is that 2007 was a good year for Unilever, marked by strong business performance; organic sales growth of 5.5% and an underlying margin improvement of 0.2%. Growth was again broad-based, it was also of good quality reflecting as it did the priorities we have set for the business. Hence, we saw a further redirecting of our business towards faster-growing D&amp;E markets and another strong performance from our Personal Care business, with growth of 6.7%. Yet at the same time, 2007 witnessed a stronger contribution from our Foods categories and benefits coming through from restructuring, especially in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Reflecting the strategy we have been pursuing over the last three years, the last twelve months were also characterized by bigger innovation, rolled out faster and across more parts of the world. A greater role for technology delivering real consumer benefits and further increases in the level of investments behind our brands. We also saw an increased contribution from pricing during the year and a higher rate of savings following the accelerated restructuring program we announced in August last year. So, the key message for 2007 is one of improved performance.</p>
          <p>But that only tells half of the story, because the result we have announced today are underpinned by and directly attributable to the significant changes we have been making to Unilever itself, both to our organizations and to our ways of working. We are today a leaner, more agile, more globally-oriented business. Our One Unilever operating model is up and running in every major country and is being extended to a series of multicountry organizations across many parts of the world, injecting even greater speed and simplicity into the organization. We have considerably streamlined our management and brought new people and new ideas. We have also raised the bar when it comes to critical capabilities like marketing and customer management. We are leveraging science and technology much more in support of our brands and categories. And we have put a ruthless focus on improving our executional capability.</p>
          <p>We have of course further to travel in all of these areas, but the progress is clear and the impact on our performance is obvious. So for all these reasons, we believe we remain on track to achieve our 2010 growth and margins targets, despite a tougher economic and cost environment. Of course, we are not complacent about the challenges that lie ahead, but Unilever today is a more resilient business than before, better placed to meet the challenges and indeed the opportunities of operating in more uncertain times.</p>
          <p>I will say more towards the end of the presentation about how we are approaching the year ahead, but first, Jim will walk you through the details of our performance in 2007. Jim?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and good morning, everyone here and everyone listening and watching. As most of you know, I joined Unilever in September this past year. By that time, Patrick and his team had already laid out Unilever's strategy and priorities for the next few years, including the accelerated change program that was announced back in August, I think, actually the day after my own appointment was announced. Now I joined the business believing that this strategy would transform Unilever's performance.</p>
          <p>Just over five months into the job, I am now even more convinced that we have a great opportunity ahead of us, notwithstanding an uncertain, possibly more difficult business environment in the immediate future. Our 2007 results underpin this confidence. It was our third consecutive year of accelerating organic sales growth to a level of 5.5% underlying sales growth in the year. We finished the year strongly, with a markedly better performance in Europe. At the same time, we saw a resumption in underlying margin improvement of some 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>With input costs rising sharply throughout the year, our pricing actions and saving programs have been critical to achieve this outcome. We saw an increasing contribution to earnings from joint ventures and associates, and from our good management of tax and balance sheet. We generated free cash flow of some &#x20AC;3.8 billion, and we increased our return on invested capital to 12.7% from 11.5% in 2006; that of course excludes the profit on the sale of frozen foods in that year.</p>
          <p>&#x20AC;3.7 billion of cash was returned to shareholders throughout the year through share buybacks and dividend payments. And we are announcing today a 7% increase in our 2007 annual dividend and a share buyback program of at least &#x20AC;1.5 billion in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the numbers in a little more detail. Our sales in Q4 were 9.9 billion, which is 1.7% ahead of last year. And it is after a 0.8% reduction from disposals and an adverse currency effect of 3.4%. The latter reflects the strength of our reporting currency, the euro, against a wide range of currencies, including the U.S. dollar and sterling. This left turnover for the full year at &#x20AC;40.2 billion, or 1.4% up.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth in 2007 was 5.5%, a material step-up from 3.8% in the prior year. Growth has been consistently strong across all four quarters; Q4 was a strong finish to the year with growth over 6%. Pricing rose steadily through the year as we took steps to recover commodity cost increases. And the pricing power of our brands has been proven and has strengthened over the past couple of years, through first, a stronger and more consistent flow of innovation; second, systematic improvement in product quality; and third, increased marketing investment behind the brand equities.</p>
          <p>Determined pricing action did have an impact on volume growth in some markets, particularly in the United States and Latin America. However, Unilever's volume growth remained robust overall, with 3.7% for the full year and 3% in Q4 which reflects the strong volume growth in our D&amp;E markets and a welcome return to volume growth in Europe. Our growth was broad-based across all our regions and all of our categories, and reflected our differentiated portfolio strategy and our allocation of resources.</p>
          <p>In Europe, underlying sales growth was just under 3% in 2007, which is up from 1% in '06; Q4 growth was 5.5%. And even allowing for a prior-year comparator which was weak and a small boost from trade buying ahead of SAP implementation in the UK and a January price increase in Germany, we believe this was good performance overall for Europe. We have seen improving year-on-year trends across Europe. Russia has been a star performer, with growth in the high teens. All our major European businesses grew in 2007, including the UK, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Sales in France were up marginally, but still better than a decline in 2006 in what remains a challenging market.</p>
          <p>The improvement has not been driven by a big step-up in A&amp;P investment. Rather, it has been driven by a relentless focus on innovation, on improving quality and value of our product offerings and on better execution in the marketplace. It is also a direct reflection of a business that is now fit to compete. Patrick referred earlier to Unilever's change program and nowhere is the pace change greater than in Europe. To put this into context, in just the last 12 months, we have sold the Boursin business and earlier this week, we agreed to buy Inmarko, the leading Ice Cream business in Russia. We have announced the closure or stream-lining of ten factories in the United Kingdom, in the Netherlands, Sweden, France and Spain. We have formed four new multi-country organizations &#x2013; UK/Ireland, Benelux, Germany, Austria and Switzerland and finally, Czech/Hungary. And, we rolled out SAP to the point where it now covers two-thirds of our European business and it will cover all of our European business before the end of this year. It all adds up to a significant step-up in productivity and it's feeding into our margins, there was an underlying improvement in our European operating margin in 2007 of 90 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Americas, full-year growth in the Americas was 4.1%. In the United States, the overall growth of our markets has held up pretty well notwithstanding the economy there. In the second half of the year, we've seen slightly weaker demand in Personal Care in the United States. There has been some softness in out-of-home channels, but in contrast, we have seen quite strong demand for food products which are used in the home such as meal kits and side-dishes. Against this background, our U.S. business delivered solid growth in the year of just over 3%. This included good growth across most of the foods categories and Personal Care and a much improved performance in Home Care. In North America ice cream, however, we did have a poor year in the North America. We are making root and branch changes to our business model here and while it causes us some short-term pain, we believe it will support a more consistent, sustainable growth going forward.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we got off to a slow start in Mexico and Brazil but our performance has picked up in both markets. Full year growth was 5.6%, and well over 6% in the fourth quarter. Operating margin was down 40 basis points on an underlying basis, in part due to increased marketing investment, but also reflecting the impact of substantial cost increases absorbed. Increased commodity costs have been a significant issue everywhere, but especially so in the Americas. We have moved decisively to increase prices across many categories and markets which has lead to significantly higher price growth in the second half but with lower volume growth. The pace of change is also significant in our Americas organization. Over the course of 2007, we have sold our Brazilian margarine brands and the Lawry's seasoning business and we have progressed the disposal process for our U.S. Laundry business</p>
          <p>We have implemented further One Unilever integration projects across the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and some other countries. We have implemented SAP across the majority of our businesses in North and South America and we've continued to build critical capabilities for example, setting up a new team in the Untied States to provide our customers with innovative shopper insights.</p>
          <p>Turning to Asia, Africa, strong growth in Asia, Africa of over 11% reflects both the vibrancy of the markets and the high priority that we have placed on building our business in this region. Here, our focus is on bringing the full scale and power of Unilever's branding, technology and innovation to bear in some of the fastest growing consumer markets in the world.</p>
          <p>We have been building on existing strong category positions across the region such as laundry and personal wash and we also seek opportunities to introduce new brands and products for our consumers across the region.</p>
          <p>Global mixes like clear anti-dandruff shampoo, which were successfully launched in China, in the Philippines and in Arabia, a new product forms like Knorr bouillon gels and Pyramid tea bags and the investment is paying off. All are major markets in Africa and Asia are growing strongly. They are led by India and China. But also include Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Our traditional strength in Home Care and Personal Care in these markets is now being complemented by strong growth across our foods categories.</p>
          <p>In summary, all three regions have made excellent progress with implementing our change program and raising the quality and speed of our go to market operations. However, they can only do so with strong brands and exciting innovations that allow them to go out and win with customers and win with consumers. This is where our global category teams are now making the difference.</p>
          <p>Across each of our four category groups, we saw growth driven by renovation &#x2013; that is the strengthening of existing brands with new variance, new packaging, new advertising and innovation, new products and new mixes.</p>
          <p>We stepped up our innovation over the past couple of years in a number of ways. First, more rapid rollout across key markets. One of our top priorities in 2007 was the simultaneous launch in seven countries of Clear, a hair care brand with superior anti-dandruff technology. This included three of the biggest hair markets in the world China, Russia and Brazil. In all markets, the brand Clear is winning consumer preference and exceeding our expectations.</p>
          <p>Second, faster deployment of new technologies. Hellmann's extra light for example, uses citrus fiber technology to give consumers a great tasting yet very low fat mayonnaise. It's a higher margin product and that's important at a time of increasing edible oil cost.</p>
          <p>Third, a better transfer of mixes across continents and cultures. After only six months, Axe is already the brand leader in male deodorants in Japan, and finally, vitality-focused innovation, which targets consumers' desire for healthier options in eating. Lipton Green in the United States, Lipton Linea slimming teas in Europe, Lipton milk teas in Asia, all leveraged tea as the healthy beverage. Now, there are many other examples which together have helped to drive the growth of our categories in 2007 and will continue to drive growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>Just a few headlines on the performance of our categories. Savoury, Dressings and Spreads grew 5% for the year. Knorr, which is our largest brand, came close to hitting 4 billion euros in sales. Hellmann's growth accelerated to 6% helped by effective advertising and the success of that extra light variant, which I mentioned a moment ago. Spreads finished the year strongly with our goodness of margarine campaign, a program of activities which promotes the health benefits of margarine.</p>
          <p>Ice Cream and Beverages grew at 4.2% in 2007. Lipton had an outstanding year with double-digit growth in systems sales &#x2013; which were recorded on our top-line &#x2013; systems sales driven by the kind of innovations I mentioned earlier. Ice cream also had a good year. Frusi, a frozen yogurt packed with fruit and cereals did well across Europe.</p>
          <p>Also in Europe, we improved our coverage across the price points with premium offerings such as Magnum Temptations as well as the rollout of Ben &amp; Jerry's and then at the other end new value packs for more price conscious consumers. And in Asia, we had success with Moo, a brand that boosts children's calcium levels.</p>
          <p>Home Care had a strong year, with 6.1% underlying sales growth. We had a good year in fabric cleaning, including the roll-out of Small &amp; Mighty in Europe and Latin America, continuing our drive towards more efficient, more environmentally friendly and higher margin concentrated liquids. In fabric conditioners, new premium variants, new fragrances and our new "fresh release" technology all helped to drive sales. And we had another successful year for our household cleaning business with brands like Cif and Domestos helping it to grow at 9%. Personal Care was once again Unilever's fastest growing of the four categories with 6.7% growth in 2007. As well as the roll-out of Clear which I mentioned. We had another year of double digit growth from Axe and Rexona. We had a new Pond's anti-ageing range in Asia with a continued flow of innovations on Dove, building on success in the self-tanning segment and driving the multi-country, multi-category launch of Dove pro&#xB7;age. So that covers what I wanted to say about the drivers of our top-line performance. Let me now turn to other aspects of our financial performance and I will start with operating margin.</p>
          <p>Our full year operating margin was 13.1% that included 875 million of restructuring charges which were partly offset by disposable profits of 306 million which leaves a net charge equivalent to 1.4% of sales in the year. Excluding, restructuring, disposables, one time gains in the prior year and those were from changes in pensions and health care. Our plans we had an underlying improvement in operating margin of 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>We continue to spend competitively behind our brands throughout the year. Advertising and promotions arose in line with sales in 2007. We had an increase of 260 million euros in constant currencies. The majority of this increase was in brand building, advertising rather than consumer promotions.</p>
          <p>We're getting more bang for our buck as in America you might say, more global advertising, meaning fewer bigger campaigns which allow us to get the best out of our advertising agencies, spend less on production, produce fewer higher quality films and copy and that then freezes up money to spend more on media time and space.</p>
          <p>The impact of commodity cost during 2007 has been the highest we have seen in many years. With the full year impact of 900 million euros, I'm going to say more about commodity cost in a minute.</p>
          <p>We have, however, been able to manage this unprecedented cost pressure thanks to consistent growth and mix improvement through pricing actions and our savings programs. Our combined savings programs have delivered close to 1 billion euros in '07. Of this close to 500 million euros was from buying savings around 300 from accelerated restructuring program, and 200 from ongoing efficiency programs.</p>
          <p>Looking at the fourth quarter, our operating margin at 11.1% was again 20 basis points higher than last year with the similar aggregate level of restructuring disposals and one-off items in each year.</p>
          <p>The shape of our margin delivery as we exceeded '07 is indicative of how our business is able to navigate through a worsening cost environment by using our pricing power, raising prices, sustaining investment behind our brands to secure consistent top-line growth and mix improvement and delivering a continued high level of savings through our global buying and restructuring programs.</p>
          <p>Now turning to commodity costs. As expected we saw another sharp increase in commodity related costs in quarter four, which was the equivalent to an on cost in the quarter of 330 million or 330 basis points. There were some reductions during the year, olive oil for example, and some commodity costs have shown signs of passing their peak such as diary which has come off.</p>
          <p>However, there are &#x2013; these are small for us when you compare them with the increases we see in edible oils and fats and other agricultural commodities, in petrochemicals, in packaging and transport, almost anything with a significant energy component.</p>
          <p>As things stand today, we expect to see similar, if not higher rate of increase than we saw in quarter four. We see that well into 2008. It maybe we'll see some sign of easing of global demand for commodities as we go through the balance of the year. But we do not expect to see much benefit from this until much later in the year if at all.</p>
          <p>Below operating profit, we continue to drive improvements in a number of areas, which have substantial positive impact on EPS growth. That financing costs were significantly lower that came through lower interest on a net borrowings and better funding position on our pensions.</p>
          <p>Our share and net profits from the joint ventures was increased by 30% in the year driven by strong growth in our ready-to-drink tea partnerships with PepsiCo. I mentioned the top line of that business moment ago.</p>
          <p>Our full-year tax rate was 22%, which was helped by a number of one-offs and particularly a lower tax rate on disposal profits and that took us below the 2006 rate of 24%. We do believe though for 2008 that we should expect a tax rate, which is closer to our long-term guidance and that's 26%.</p>
          <p>Finally it's worth noting that in 2006 as you make your comparisons, we took a 300 million euro provision, which related to the conversion of the preference shares which should have been done back in 2005. All of this led to an increase in earnings per share from continuing operations in 2007 of some 12%.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our financial strategy targets a competitive balance sheet with a strong single "A" credit rating and that puts Unilever into about the median of our peer group. Its strikes balance between optimizing our cost of capital on the one hand while making sure that our financing does not become a constraint on our business strategy. We reviewed it this carefully. We've concluded that we've got the balance about right. In fact the recent credit crunch refocused many minds on the benefits of favorable access to debt markets and reinforced the importance of long return perspective. I just said for instance that throughout this recent turmoil from August through the fall, we have maintained a sizable and a low cost commercial paper program, which is very much in the interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our cash generation continues to be strong, in 2007 cash flow from operating activities was 5.2 billion euros that was 400 million euros lower than '06, which reflected higher cash cost of restructuring, and our accelerated contributions to pensions. Working capital improved in 2007, for the third year in a row.</p>
          <p>During the year, we invested about 1 billion euros net in capital expenditure. Our net debt at the end of the year was 8.3 billion, which is up from 7.5 year-end '06. That change in net debt includes the impact of dividends, which totaled 2.2 billion returned to shareholders as well as 1.5 billion of share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Our net pension liability at the end of December was 1.1 billion and this is down from 3.1 billion at the start of the year driven by accelerated funding contributions, I mentioned a moment ago and by higher discount rate, which is applied to the calculation of long-term liabilities.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, we are recommending a final dividend of 0.50 euro cents per NV ordinary share and 34.11 pence per PLC share, which will raise our full-year dividend by 7% on both shares. We are also going to continue with share buybacks. We've a plan to buyback at least 1.5 billion euros of shares during 2008.</p>
          <p>Patrick, back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. You would have seen from our press release this morning that we are confident that 2008 will mark another step towards our 2010 goals for an operating margin in excess of 15%, while delivering consistent competitive growth along the way.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we expect underlying sales growth to be towards the upper end of our 3 to 5 range and to see further underlying improvement in our operating margin. We're clearly facing the more challenging business environment in 2008. And I want therefore to wrap it by giving you my perspective on how I see the year ahead and why I believe that Unilever is well placed to meet these challenges and to exploit opportunities that may arise from a changed scenario.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the macro economic environment. There is no doubt that some kind of economic slowdown in the U.S. is now underway and judging by recent forecast, we should expect to see slower GDP growth in other economies during 2008 especially in Europe. However, we expect the aggregate growth rates of our market in 2008, to remain strong at between 4 and 5%. There are two reasons why we can be positive about the outlook for growth. First and fortunately for us consumer still wants to eat and wash even when discretionary expenditure is tight.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned earlier, belt tightening by consumers does lead to changes in consumer patterns. But the breadth of our categories and brand portfolio, we should straddle price points, channels and different consumer needs means these shifts in consumer behavior are as much an opportunity as a challenge as we enter 2008.</p>
          <p>Second, we benefit from a broad geographic exposure including of strong presence in Asia. And while we could see the large emerging market economies come off there 2007 peaks. We expect to see strong growth in these markets during 2008. And now another area of uncertainty is commodity cost. As Jim said this would be a significant challenge in 2008, but as we have shown in 2007, we're equipped to deal with it.</p>
          <p>Over the past three years, we've changed our business model in the way that make us more resilient with the stronger innovation pipeline, we've invested more behind brand equity and in product quality and this today gives us the pricing power we need &#x2013; to pass on cost increases, while maintaining market competitiveness. And we are leaner, fitter, faster organization better able to response quickly to challenges and opportunities in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We are also well underway with our accelerated restructuring program that will deliver significant productivity gains over the next few years with a robust operating trend for 2008 based on realistic assumption about the business environment and the strong program of innovation and marketing. And with a clear set of business priorities, which have governed our plans since 2005, and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Firstly, maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace and deliver consistent top line growth. Second, to drive our sustainable margin improvement keeping us on track to deliver our longer term financial goals, and third to invest selectively in getting market share where the opportunity arises and when the return on investment is attractive.</p>
          <p>So, resilient business product, robust operating plan, a clear set of priorities and a continued commitment to delivering shareholder value. We, therefore, enter 2008, from a position of growing strengths clear on what we need to do and on track to deliver our objectives.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'll happy now to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Fine. And we've got three sets of questions; people here, we've got people coming in</p>
          <p>on telephones over the air and we're also getting in some on text messaging. So any, which we'll, which we'll bring in if there any that haven't been covered already on, on air. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I hope you got that. Okay, so three sets of people and Patrick will start here. Martin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, morning. It's Martin Dolan from Execution. And can I just clarify something, if we can, in that, there were some comments on newswires this morning that you said that you expected a moderate growth in Europe in the first quarter and also a slowdown in the, in Americas which doesn't seem to tie up with the top end of the range guidance. Were you misinterpreted this morning or are you seeing a slowdown in the first quarter already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim will answer the question because he was on the newswire, but, if we does, if we did that, I mean just be absolutely clear that we stick, we stick by the guidance that we've given and I am very confident we're going to deliver it. Now, as to the newswire, Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We commented on the fourth quarter in the Americas and you've seen the numbers which I just reviewed for the Americas. And we said, notwithstanding what we've seen in the last quarter, we, we go into the New Year across all of our regions confident that we'll be at the upper end of our guidance. We were asked whether the growth in Europe could be sustained from the fourth quarter into the first, and we commented that probably about 50 basis points of the growth in Europe was due to the pull forward in the UK, with the SAP implementation as well as accelerated buying in Germany with price increase coming on the first of January, so we said the rate of growth that we saw in Europe was a little bit flattered by that.</p>
          <p>We also commented that we saw price coming through in Europe, which we've not seen through the first three quarters and we were very pleased by that. It has not affected volume and the fourth quarter; volume is still good in Europe. But, you know, the prices have just come through and so you don't know exactly what the tradeoff will be between price and volume in Europe in the first quarter. So, whatever it was that was said, that is what is being said, and we remain with our guidance at upper end of 3, 3 to 5% for the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. John Parker from Deutsche Bank. You commented that you expect the commodity costs to be going up at the sort of running, higher running rate we've seen in the fourth quarter as you enter the New Year. Can you give any corresponding guidance on your cost savings? It looks to me as though there was a bit of step up in the level of cost savings in the fourth quarter, total for the year you said about a billion. If one assumes that sort of stepped-up rate in the fourth quarter ran through into '08, you'd see a higher level of cost savings in '08 compared with '07. Is that a reasonable expectation or can you give any sort of indications on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is certainly a very reasonable expectation. Our cost saving in the fourth quarter was in excess of 300 basis points, so very strong, and we feel confident that we'll attack 2008 benefiting from these specifics program for the commodity, as Senior reflected exactly what we said about our expectation, that it would remain at high level well into 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And one other quick question: are you going to say anything about the phasing of the performance through 2008 at this point? You've obviously given guidance on sales growth and margins for the full year. Do you &#x2013; is there anything you want to say about the first half being stronger or weaker? Or, I mean, obviously, you've got an early Easter; you had a poor Q3 last year. Is there anything at this point you want to guide us to on phasing in 2008?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's nothing we'd like to do by way of guidance quarter-by-quarter for the year; we'll give you the full-year guidance. We feel good about that, that full-year guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Charlie Mills, Credit Suisse. I wonder if you could give your thoughts on pricing in 2008 given those commodity headwinds and, obviously, what looks like a pretty rapid pickup in price through the course of 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim will take the question 2008; let's just wrap up 2007. We've seen healthy and increasing contribution from prices to our topline. The good news is that the balance in term of volume and price was a good one. We delivered in 2007 a better volume growth than in 2006, despite price increase, which were considerably higher and in the last quarter, half volume, half price <mark type="inaudible" /> and in Europe, the best volume performance that we have had during the year. As to 2008...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As to 2008, you know, we'll have rollover of price increases which we've taken through the course of '07. As I mentioned a little while ago we took some prices in Germany right at the start of the year. We'll not be commenting on specific plans we have for specific categories, specific countries over the course of the year, but I would expect that we will be taking pricing in particular categories, in particular countries over the course of the year. And all of that is part of our confidence in saying that, along with the topline guidance that we've given, we also are giving guidance of underlying margin growth in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add something, Charlie, not on the cost and price has been well, well covered but we are playing with different levels. When it come to getting back at some of the cost increase and a couple of things we've done, and I spoke about technology, we are driving more technology oriented innovational end-market. We've also been putting innovation at Clear, good example, at much higher price point, Clear is priced about 160 against the market average of, of 100. We've also encouraging in specific category, the conversion to -- from certain types of product to other, which are, in term of margin, much more favorable. The best example would be concentrate detergent. One of the reason for improvement in margin 2007 in laundry is because we are aggressively driving concentrate rather than dilutes, and all that is part of the instrument, because we only want to pass on to the consumer that part of the pricing of the cost increase which we cannot get in other way, especially with higher value offered to the consumer.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question that came on the disposal program: you have only actually executed &#x20AC;200 million of revenues out of the two billion. Can you maybe comment on whether that's still on track, or is there a risk that perhaps some of the businesses that you've outlined could perhaps be retained? And just as an add-on to that, if the proceeds do come through and if disposals are executed, could that sort of cloud your thinking on the buyback assumptions as those proceeds come through? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And then the second one is on Latin America. I note that quite a big pick up in performance in the second half of the year relative to the first half. Can you maybe outline what's driven that and whether you -- we should expect that momentum to continue into '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me answer the last question about Latin America. Indeed, you did see a pickup through the course of the year, and it was particularly true in Brazil, which has been a strong grower for us over the years, it's one of the D&amp;E markets which should lift Unilever's growth generally because of the development of the consumer products in that country. But we started off the year slow, but through the course of the year we've picked up speed, and we certainly are carrying that through into the New Year and we feel confident about Brazil. And the similar story is true for Mexico where we'd started slow and has ended strong. So we feel good about Latin America going into the year.</p>
          <p>As to your first question, there were two parts to it; I'm going to take the second first, which is, you know, proceeds from disposals. Obviously, you can't count on them; you can't count on when they come, how much they'll be. And so we are not making commitments today for what we will do with those proceeds; that would be imprudent. But I would note that we've said that as to the share buyback program, we will do at least 1.5 billion and obviously, an option for us when and if we get proceeds of whatever amount is to use it to take the 1.5 at least to something more. But today is not the day to say what those proceeds would be or what we will do with them.</p>
          <p>As to the process, we announced back in August, six months ago, that over the next couple of years, we would dispose of &#x20AC;2 billion of topline sales. We have said very clearly that we will dispose of them for a value, creating price for our shareholders. Thus far, we have announced two deals. We've announced Borsa and we've closed the sale of Borsa and we've announced Lawry's, and that sale is pending. We are in the process of disposing of our North American laundry business, and other than that we've not cited anything else. And we will not until we have actually either gone public with the sale process or we have concluded a sale.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Polly Barclay from Cazenove. Just a follow-up question on pricing. In Q4 we saw volumes plus 4.2% in Europe and negative 0.3% in the Americas. Can you just give us a bit more color on the pricing environment specifically in Europe and the Americas, and the volume impact and how you see this playing out in '08? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will do Europe, and Jim will do the U.S.; it looks appropriate. I think somewhere in the speech, we said the toughest environment for price increases is Europe. Now the side problem with that, is that we had our best performance in Europe in quarter four with the highest price increase -- we are 1 point to 1.3 up, once we have been negative during the year. We had also the best volume performance of the year, at a bit in excess of 4% and even taking into account the 40, 50 basis point Jim talked about, it was a good solid performance.</p>
          <p>Now, there surely will be a bit of a correction, but at this stage we have been able to keep a healthy balance, price and volume. And one of the reason, I believe, is the improvement that we have made both to our go-to-market but also to increasing quality of our offering, product offering that is. In Europe specifically, we reduce marketing spending, so the turnaround is not derived from massive spending with the consumer or the customer; it is good housekeeping and innovation as well as go-to-market. As to the U.S....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the U.S. and Americas -- make the distinction. We took some, you know, very significant price increases through the year and in particular in Q4, and it was reflected in the mix between price and volume in the Americas. We feel good about the contribution that the Americas will make in '08, as I commented before about Latin America. We've seen an acceleration in Mexico and Brazil. That's notwithstanding Brazil, some very significant price increases as commodity costs were up sharply there. So we continued to feel that we'll achieve appropriate price realization in the Americas. We'll see growth in Americas, which will contribute to our overall upper end of 3 to 5% for that for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've two questions if I may. The first is on your guidance on commodities moving from a run rate of 330 basis points into 2008. Could you also update us a bit more on your hedging policy for '08, how much are you going to see as a positive or a negative impact on those? And the second question is on your guidance, you signal a lot of ambition for fiscal year '08 to move to the upper ends of the 3 to 5% range. This bodes on which assumptions exactly again? Maybe, you can clarify to us again on why you are so optimistic on your guidance for '08 to reach the top end of the 3 to 5%? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me firstly answer this question and Jim will take the question on the commodity. First, over the past two to three years, we've dramatically changed the shape of this portfolio and especially &#x2013; Unilever portfolio, and especially the exposure to developing and emerging market. Our portfolio momentum has improved and that's here to stay with the 44% and probably plus, going forward developing and emerging market.</p>
          <p>Second, we've strengthened our business in term of the quality, in term of investment behind the brand and that in turn give us pricing power.</p>
          <p>Third, we have a very broad footprint when it come to the sort of product that we have. We sell to consumer with $2 per day and we sell also to the very affluent consumer. We believe and that's the final comment, that in the growth of the market in 2008, there will be a pricing component, which we have seen in 2007, which is still going to be significant, so that we see the growth of our market between 4 and 5%, and we believe that within that range we are competitive and we believe, hence, that it is <mark type="inaudible" /> share this belief and optimism with you and the upper end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to input cost inflation just to reiterate the guidance, we saw 220 basis points increase over course of the year, 330 in the fourth quarter. The rate of increase that we've seen in the fourth quarter we expect to see out into 2008. And we do hedge certain of our commodities. We hedge them when we think we can buy at a price today, which will be better than the prices in the future. There are some commodities which we cannot hedge even if we have a point of view as to what the prices will be in the future versus now. All I can say as to, you know, what we have done is that, we have hedged certain of our costs and we have concluded that we can give you guidance for underlying operating margin increase, notwithstanding those input costs through the course of the year, due to what we see of those input costs, due to savings programs, restructuring that we have been doing, we continue to do, buying savings that we have and other operating efficiencies combined with the pricing which we've talked about at some length already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final follow-up question, if I may, just as a confirmation on your tax rate guidance that was 26% for the fiscal year '08. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is, that is correct, 26% is both our long-term tax rate guidance. We were well below that this year because of the tax consequences of certain disposals as well as we got some, we're able to take way some provisions because we got favorable audits for past tax years. Absent that we'd have been closer to the 26% long term. What we are saying for '08 is we expect at this point now that it will be at the longer term 26% rate, but again, you never know exactly, you know, what audits are going to come in, you don't know. You have to take things on a quarter-by-quarter basis, which we used to be able to smooth. So it's our guidance, it's also our expectation, but there's can't be certainty about that sort of thing anymore.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, guys good morning. Jan Meijer, Theodoor Gilissen. I've got a question on the restructuring costs, last year you've stated that the normal level was between 0.5% and 1%, this year it's 1.4%. What are your expectations in '08 and '09? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have in August, clearly indicated a step up in, in our restructuring program. We've guided towards about 1 billion a year. We came a bit short of, of this amount in 2007 at about 900 million, and I think 1 billion is at this stage the number that you should focus. We've taken some distance up to 2010 with this 0.5% and explained the rationale of an active restructuring program in August with our results. This times it's Xavier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we take one from the lines, we've got a question in, Patrick, from Michael Styve. Do you see any signs of consumers trading down to more value oriented brands such as Suave, in light of the weakening economic outlook and price increases? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. Suave interestingly enough had a good, a good third quarter and if you asked me the question at the end of the third quarter, I would have said I see some sign. For example, Suave which is our value, value proposition in the U.S., but the fourth quarter was unremarkable and hence across the portfolio at this stage, we've not seen a trading down by consumers. And again we've been very, very intent in improving the quality of our offering and that surely is part of the answer that the more quality visibly you offer the consumer, the greater the opportunity that they will show loyalty to the brand. When your value proposition is unclear, that's the temptation to go to, to go to a lower prices.</p>
          <p>Remarkable also for me this year was the performance of, of our spreads business, which is really where you see normally this trading down taking place. We finished the year close to 4% and not because of the poor activity of this year, they had an unremarkable year, but the core of the business, what we call the family goodness delivered outstanding result and that's normally a place where we see right away the impact of down trading. So long answer, short answer is no. Xavier has been stewing for about half an hour.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez, Exane. I have two related questions on market share trends. In '07 you have a growth volume around 3 to 4%, 3.5, 4%. Is this broadly the trend you would guess, was the market trend, volume trend you have been in 2007? And if you could give a bit of color in terms of market share trends by categories or zones, Western Europe in particular. And the second question: entering '08, you say 4 to 5, which probably implies flat value shares. What are your assumptions in terms of volume trend in '08? Is it down versus '07 significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first talk about market share, I know that's a subject which always attracts a lot of interest, Charlie. First of all, depending on the sort of product, volume share doesn't make any sense; you don't sell deodorant by the kilo, it's all about value. So the main reference for market share is value market share. Globally, with a growth at about 5.5%, I didn't right again broadly in-line, that's where believe we are. If I would go footprint, I would say we tend to win in area where we've invested a lot like Asia and Personal Care, weaker in some developed market, and I say example in Europe and some category in the U.S. where we have a weak contract of the money spend. Altogether, I am satisfied that we are competitive, and if you look at 2008 and what we have said in terms of strategy. Our first priority is to maintain competitiveness, and that mean, in plain language, maintain your overall value of market share. For my team, it means something very different for Harish Manwani here for Asia, than for Kees van der Graaf or even Mike Polk in the U.S. And in order to achieve that, we deliver the resource according to this priority in a very, very disciplined way.</p>
          <p>The second priority is to seek improvement in operating margin because that's the biggest flavor for us in terms of the TSR. The third, and here we are, is selectively increase market share. Now, the situation in 2008 is uncertain, because the price and cost increases we talked about are industry cost and price increases. And there is some question mark as to exactly the volume of money, which is going to be spent. We expect no relief in volume of money spent behind the brand competitively. But I don't know what's going to happen. So as far as the overall message is concerned, maintain our competitiveness number one. Second, improve <mark type="inaudible" /> numbers selectivity depending on the return and <mark type="inaudible" /> seek for increased market share. It's not the moment necessarily to go gung-ho into going for extraordinary market share at extraordinary cost. And this is not the priorities that we have set for company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To make sure, if we assume that you have been flat shares in '07 and you will have basically flat shares into '08. It implicitly means that you have a significant slowdown in market growth implicit in your assumption in '08-'07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've said market goals would be 4 to 5, I believe we said that. And I believe would be in the upper end of 3 to 5. So it doesn't necessarily follow that we have a substantial lower market goals. Just somewhat slower market goals, but certainly not to a point which endangers our objective.</p>

          <p>Julian Hardwick of ABN AMRO. Patrick in your presentation or maybe James given his presentation highlighted the issues in U.S. Ice Cream business, I wondered if you could just go into bit more detail about what the problems there. And did I understand the implication that we shouldn't expect to see U.S. Ice Cream improve materially in the short term as you go through the restructuring of that business. And my second question to Jim, if I take on board some of the sort of negative headwinds you've got in most of the financial area such as tax, currency, dilution from disposals, it would seem to me as though you're probably going to struggle to deliver much in the way of earnings per share growth this year, is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can add a first thing to the first questions, so that Jim can give you an appropriate answer to the question which is more complex, but if I can first remember what the first question was. North American Ice Cream, here we are. First, the first thing to say before we talk about 2007 is that North American Ice Cream has been an outstanding success story for Unilever and an extraordinary amount of value delivered. Tick. What has happened in 2006 and 2007 is a change in competitive dynamics and a new business model emerging less reliant on promotion, less reliant on street fighting, much more on the agenda because of the changing competitive dynamics, innovation, technology, branding. We talk about exactly the business model that we have; you remember it was a very separated, isolated, not simply physically, if you've ever been to Grand Bay, you will understand what I'm talking about, a separate business model. We saw there was an opportunity now because of the change in competitive dynamics to change our business model.</p>
          <p>So, we are now moving to one Unilever model and similarly to any other organization in Unilever in the world. So, combined with the Food business, we're changing the go-to-market approach, moving from a very dedicated sales force to using the full power of our go-to-market in U.S., which I'll remind you has been voted best vendor by Wal-Mart, which we're very proud of, and more importantly use the full weight of the global work that Vindi and his team are doing, I'm going to ask him in one second to comment a bit on that. In the process what we've done, we're cutting the money on promotion, we have bring the pricing up, and are seeing much more innovation and R&amp;D. Changing people, changing leadership, changing everything that can be changed. The yields transition, we had a marked improvement in the first quarter also a bit flattering for me, because they improve a bit more and I will expect them initially to sustain this rate, but I would expect certainly a better year in Ice Cream as we, Unileverize this company in-line with any other. The benefit for us is obvious, and Vindi is going to talk about the opportunity to leverage our global organization. Vindi, who's our President of Foods.</p>

          <p>Thank you Patrick. Well, Patrick has already talked about the North American business, so let me tell you a little bit about what's happening on the global Ice Cream business which we can then use to bear on our situation in North America. We have had a good year in Ice Cream in Europe and very good growth in the rest of the world and that's being driven by a lot of innovation and its being driven by innovation, led by activities across the whole price spectrum. So, we've had very good high quality introductions at the top-end of the market with the Magnum range, the new variance, which improved very successful, excellent quality, uptrading. We've had very healthy options like Frusi, which was talked about, which is a mix of cereal, yoghurt and fruit. We've also had internationally overseas a product like Moo, that you see there, which is the child's third glass of milk. So actually you see a lot of innovations across the price spectrum and with vitality at its heart. All of these are backed by a proprietary technology that Unilever has and I think that is our big opportunity as we change the model in the North American business from being very much more of a promo-led model to the classic model that I have just described.</p>

          <p>As to earnings per share, we are in a transitional mode right now as Unilever with disposals, with gains on disposals, with restructuring charges, with an accounting gain from changing the ownership of our South African and Israeli business with our partner. And so, we do not give guidance on EPS. We do not think EPS is the best measure of Unilever performance today, nor will it be in 2008.</p>
          <p>I went through an explanation how you got to the particular EPS we got to in '07. And obviously, you know, relative to '08, you should expect restructuring charges, you may see gains on disposal you may not see gains on disposal &#x2013; I've cited the tax rate. But it will be a couple of years before EPS as reported by IFRS, pure, simple, is a fair measure of what the earning power and what the progress is of Unilever. Between now and that point, you know, we believe what &#x2013; certainly what we're looking to as metrics are top line growth and underlying operating margin improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Martin. Martin Deboo, Investec. Can I, Jim, just build on your answer to that question. You indicated when you joined that you would take the opportunity to sort of reappraise the financial performance regime and if appropriate introduce new metrics. I would infer from today that you've concluded that change isn't necessary, can you comment on that? It's a question less about guidance; it's a question about the metrics, per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As to metrics, I do believe that the best measure of us now is top-line revenue growth. I think it also needs to be measured against the market growth. And are we gaining, holding, or losing share? I think that's an absolutely vital metric for our company. I think, second, the underlying operating margin is critical, you know, are &#x2013; is the money that we're spending in restructuring, is the change in organization to one Unilever, is that delivering a greater real earning power?</p>
          <p>Of course, paying lower taxes is a good thing to do and of course good financial management below the line is important, too. We're going to do that as we go along. We just don't think that when you get down to the bottom, the EPS line, that that's going to be particularly, you know, important, because it is going so overwhelmed by the restructuring charges and the gains on disposals. So for the moment, I don't think &#x2013; I do believe, we will get to a time when EPS is again an important metric. And I will, you know, be the first to say here's what I think, you know, we ought to be targeting for and attract against. But I don't believe the time is now.</p>
          <p>I have also looked not just at the income statement but at the balance sheet and, you know, we have a policy today of maintaining an A-plus rating. That is consistent with having funding which is about half short, half long, which lowers our cost of capital. I think that is a good thing to do. I believe, though, it is only prudent to do that if you maintain an A1, B1, short-term rating, which we do. Within that constraint, though, we are able to fully fund our restructuring program, fully fund our CapEx, grow our business in a good way. And we are able to pay a dividend, which will increase by 7% this year and provide a very attractive yield relative to the share price. And there is still cash left over to do at least 1.5 billion share back in this year. And as we enter this year, I think that is a whole set of actions which is sensible for the shareholder in the short term and is prudent for the shareholder in the longer term, in terms of maintaining strength and flexibility.</p>

          <p>Hi. This is James Edwards Strange from Execution. You had about 240 basis points of cost savings in 2007 on the back of about a 210-basis-point-restructuring charge. How long can you sustain cost savings in excess of your restructuring spend? And as a follow-up, can you just give us the number for the aggregates underlying revenue growth in D&amp;E markets, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, you noted the average in the year. I think that, also noted the acceleration was in excess of 300 basis point. As to D&amp;E market, the growth was around 10%. We had 11% in, 11% plus, in Asia, around 6% in Latin America with the fourth quarter well above six. So that's the underlying growth, if you want, in 2007 for most of D&amp;E.</p>
          <p>And as to the &#x2013; coming back to restructuring program, we share with you the yield on the investment that we are making. And Jim said that about 300 million from the one billion saving we made in 2007 was just a follow-up &#x2013; following up -- the actual restructuring program started mid-year. I think, as usual, the share of that particular restructuring, of course, increasing in 2008.</p>
          <p>The other comment that probably you saw is the strength of our buying savings. It is not simply because the raw material or else would be more expensive. It is much more because all the simplification, amortization, of the business gives us much more bargaining power and much more leverage in term of volume. And hence, the opportunity for us with a simple portfolio, more organized portfolio, to leverage our scale. And there is no reason that any of that would not continue in 2008.</p>
          <p>It's going to continue at a pace which depends a little bit, of course, of negotiations with our social partner, is a program of initiating of manufacturing activities in Europe and also in Asia. So I feel good about our program, and we will be able to match and get the right balance with the commodity, cost increase and return the <mark type="inaudible" /> promise the return from the restructuring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question. Just to be clear, can we expect savings in 2008 to be running at around the 320-basis-point level that you achieved in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not going to enter into a basis point again. Let me try to answer your question differently. We delivered about one billion of savings in 2007. I see similar numbers for 2008. Now you can now calculate basis point and make assumption from all the others. But we feel good about the firm, otherwise we are not talk about margin improvement.</p>
          <p>John is saying me that we've got not much in time now?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we're at the end of your time because you are going to be, we are going to take one more question. We got questions on the air as well. And we will have to take them up with the IR team afterwards. So if we take one last question, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; hi. It's Chris Whickem from Mindfirst. Just going back to the area about scope for down trading. I mean, presumably when you are seeing input costs rise, you know, the actual percentage difference it makes to achieve a product's pricing is going to be larger than it is for the premium brands like yourself. I mean, how closely, then, do you track, or can you share with us your findings about how much the percentage price difference between your products and generics/cheaper alternatives is narrowing? And whether that's a feature of the resistance to people trading down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's a good, very good point. You know, it depends on the cost structure, but if your cost of input is 70% of your selling price for private label or else low cost producer, and it is 40% for us, in term of percentage increase to work over the same outsourced increase, they will difference from, let's say, four to seven in this particular example.</p>
          <p>So, significant difference. But we follow that very carefully because we, what we &#x2013; we're very careful about the distance, is a price structure. In any one of our categories, we look at price point. Price point top, middle, bottom, bit more complicated, but let's &#x2013; and of course, we want to competitive in each and every one of these sectors.</p>
          <p>So the way we are going to follow is effective price, that we are going to see them at the bottom of the market and drive our strategy accordingly. But, you are absolutely right in the analysis that in term of increasing raw material costs a branded manufacturer with different cost structure can be at advantage because of the price increase. They are going to do in percentages lower than the private label. Alternatively, of course, when the prices are going down, the reverse-we look up. One more question from the...</p>

We are not na&#xEF;ve, we know it is going to be tougher out there, but we feel good about the performance, and feel good about our plans for 2008.</p>
