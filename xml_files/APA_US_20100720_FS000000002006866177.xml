          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Christian and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our host, Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on such short notice to discuss Apache Corporation's second quarter results and the just announced acquisition of the BP assets. You should be aware that an additional press release on the associated financing was also just released, but please note we will not take any questions on the financing during this call.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have prepared remarks from Steve Farris, our Chairman and CEO, utilizing presentation slides that are available on our homepage of the web site which can be found at www.apachecorp.com. Please note that you will advance the slides yourself. We will not be advancing them for you. Additional details on the properties are available in the slide appendix, but will not be covered during today's call. We will be taking questions after concluding the prepared remarks. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our web site on the second page of the reference slides. With that I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom, and thank you, everybody for joining us today. I know it's late. We have two things to announce. One is great big and the other one is standard business. But before it gets lost in the translation, Apache had a hell of a quarter this quarter and I'd like to just go over the highlights.</p>
          <p>You have a page there &#x2013; I think its Page 3 that shows Apache's second quarter financial highlights. We earned $860 million or $2.53 a share which is up 22% from the prior quarter. Our production was up a little over 10% actually, sequentially from the first quarter to 647,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Our cash flow was up 17% and importantly as we go forward, our cash on the balance sheet was $1.8 billion and at the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-cap was at 22%.</p>
          <p>What really drove that growth was the full quarter of Van Gogh and Pyrenees on and Australia and some good results in Egypt. Van Gogh and Pyrenees were up about 30,000 barrels a day. The Van Gogh was our development. It's producing about 55,000 barrels a day which we own 52.5%. And the Pyrenees is a BHP development that we own about 30% of it and made about 95,000 barrels a day. So we had a very good indigenous growth as a company and we have a lot of good things ahead of us.</p>
          <p>One of those things is the transaction that we just announced this afternoon after the market closed. And it is a strategic exit by BP from three core areas that are very strong to Apache. They are Permian, Canadian and the Western Desert of Egypt. And before you go through all the numbers and we go through all the numbers, we are really buying individual businesses, because this is a complete exit by BP from these areas. Apache has made a living off of the sales packages of majors and I will tell you for the first time in our history and &#x2013; we have an opportunity to take a major out of three core areas that are going businesses. And this doesn't just include production, it includes field studies, seismic, a tremendous amount of acreage besides the producing wells that they have right now. And we're tremendously excited about it.</p>
          <p>They're long-lived legacy properties. You can read on the slide yourself. Number of development projects. We do get some midstream assets with these that add to the value. And they really play to Apache's core competency which is adding value to under worked assets. And an old clich&#xE9; is the best place to find new reserves is in mature areas, and this is right in our wheelhouse.</p>
          <p>The transaction itself, I'll turn to the next page, Page 5. I've talked a little bit about what the transaction is. The Canadian upstream business, it does exclude the oil sands and their NGL business. Other than that it is a complete exit by BP. It's the entire Permian Basin business unit and it's the entirety of the Western Desert of Egypt.</p>
          <p>The transaction value is $7 billion. The accepted date is July 1. We will make a $5 billion deposit to BP by July 30. And these transactions are subject to only regulatory clearances in different locales, so there's a number of different regulatory clearances here in the States with Hart-Scott-Rodino, we've got some filings in Canada to make, the Foreign Investment Review Board. And in Egypt it will be subject to EGPC's approval.</p>
          <p>The next slide is a summary of what we have come up with so far. And I say come up with so far because we'll be working these assets for the years to come.</p>
          <p>We have about 385 million barrels of proved reserves. We've evaluated so far 181 million barrels of probables. Total P1/P2 are 566 million barrels, producing about 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we're going to pick up 2.4 million acres across these regions; 763,000 acres in the Permian Basin, of which 400,000 are fee minerals. So it has &#x2013; they're in perpetuity.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, we have a big acreage spread there but we picked up 400,000 acres in a very prolific area in the Western Desert. And we picked up 1.2 million acres in Canada. And I'll go through a little bit of why we think that's so valuable.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the way we've allocated values in terms of values for each region, Canada's 3.25 billion, the different color slides there show the proved reserves, what we've put on probable, how much we've put on acreage, and then the mid-stream, and a very small amount for exploration, and that is in Egypt. In terms of the acreage, we've only valued two plays. We valued the undeveloped fee minerals in the Permian Basin, which were about 250,000 acres, and we also valued the 44,000 acres in the Montney Play. They have 44,000 acres that underlie their Noel development but those acres are right in the heart of the play. The only two values that we put on acreage, so I would say we have a lot of value to allocate, but we'll see that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the Permian Basin, and the most important thing about this slide is, look at the acreage position. You look at Apache's acreage position, you look at BP's acreage position, and you add in the Mariner acquisition that's on the eastern side of the Permian Basin. We now have a sizeable combined acreage position in a very, very prolific area. Our combined region, at the end of this, we'll have about 700 million barrels of oil, and we'll be producing about 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, One of the strongest regions we'll have in the company. It's interesting that, unbeknownst to us, we opened our Midland office July 12 of this year, really in anticipation of -- long before Mariner at the time -- as to really making this much more of a core area because of the oil content associated with it. But we have our office open now. We'll be bringing the Mariner folks over, and I'm sure we'll be bringing some BP folks over as we move forward.</p>
          <p>The interesting thing, BP spent about 25 million dollars so far in 2010. They spent 50 million dollars in 2009. These are very under-worked assets. BP has not drilled an operated well in the last 4 years. So far we've identified more than 2,000 infield drilling locations. We haven't booked any of those locations, but we've got over 2,000 infield drilling locations, the Yeso is in the South East New Mexico Play, and the Spraberry is where that green stuff is, out there on the eastern edge of the acreage position.</p>
          <p>It also increases our interest in some very key fields for us. NEDU, which is we drilled on for a number of years, New Mexico Federal Unit which is NMFU. We had 25%; that gives us 50%. Actually ConocoPhillips has been somewhat of a hang up in making that activity out there and this gives us a real position which to control the opportunities out there. Great fit, great business unit.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Canada, again I direct you to this &#x2013; just the acreage that you see on that slide, huge acreage position. We have about 4.3 million acres. You add BP's 1.3 million acres and you've got 5.7 million acres in one of the most prolific gas basins in the world. Our production goes up to significant, about 117,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And our reserves are over 750 million barrels.</p>
          <p>A couple of plays and in your appendix you'll see and I'd direct you to the red stuff over there just on the BP border called Noel Montney. I'll give you an example of a majors activity. They have put in $600 million worth of infrastructure in that field. They have takeaway capacity for over 100 million a day. They're now out there drilling wells. They're at about 42 million a day today. They planned this to ramp up to 100 million a day and hold it flat for 15 years. So our job will be to not only get it to 100 million a day, but to accelerate that. We think and I think they've shown about a Tcf of gas in that field and that totally excludes any of the Montney. They drilled a Montney Well &#x2013; they drilled two Montney Wells. The first Montney Well that they drilled was at 130 meters of Montney in it, so great upside.</p>
          <p>A number of other plays, the Mountain Front play. They also have a coal-bed methane play that's called Mist Mountain down in the south. In terms of our capital program for each one of these, I will tell you right now our case has about $300 million of capital for 2011. That's not what we're going to spend. It is the way we have put together the evaluation. We're going to have to get our regions to look at these projects, because of the early release &#x2013; the leaks that we had in our discussions with BP. We pretty well held this very tight internally, so our regions haven't had a big opportunity to look at what we've put together for them. But we'll be doing that over the next several weeks and come up with a plan for each one of these core areas.</p>
          <p>I'm flipping to the Western Desert now. The red is 400,000 acres, but it gets lost in our 11 million acres in Egypt.</p>
          <p>Apache controls the Western Desert. And one of the biggest pluses of this is what it does to our control over the infrastructure. Although it's not shown on this slide and in your appendix, you'll see the line to the &#x2013; on the coast that goes from west to east takes about 970 million cubic feet of gas a day. 800 million of that is Apache's.</p>
          <p>We are now at constraint. We have built a line down to the South that goes through the Qattara Depression down there. We built that in 1997 and since then we've been trying to get into that line that goes east-west on the south side that's labeled BP. That's a pipeline that's ready for about 140 million a day.</p>
          <p>There's also a gas plant there. We should be able to increase our production out of the Western Desert. And we have about 300 million a day of pent-up production that we can't move because of pipeline capacity. So this gives us a real opportunity not only to put gas down that line but possibly loop that line. It's a 24-inch line. We're going to have to do some work on it but it gives us a new opportunity to take gas out of the Western Desert.</p>
          <p>Although small, that 400,000 acres, if you look at two of the largest fields ever discovered in Egypt, they're right around it. The BED Field which is a Shell field has made over a Tcf and a half of gas already. It's still producing 10,000 barrels a day and 129 million cubic feet of gas a day.</p>
          <p>Vegas just made a recent discovery in 2007 which they were reporting as one and a half Tcf of gas and 200 million barrels of oil. BP has never shot 3D &#x2013; new 3D seismic over this. In fact they are just now shooting the 3D seismic because they anticipated drilling these wells themselves.</p>
          <p>BP's business units were not aware of this transaction until the last week. And they were continuing to work these properties. So it is a great add-on. Although not big, we only paid $650 million for this, it has great synergies for what we're doing in the Western Desert.</p>
          <p>The next slide I'll show is the combined slide for Apache. And this is APA after Mariner and after Devon but before the BP transaction. I might point out if you look to the left there, there's a little box that shows what we reported before we had Mariner and Devon for the first quarter of 2010 was 588,000 barrels of oil a day. When we come out of this on a pro forma basis, we will have added 200,000 barrels a day since the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So we've had significant growth. All of that growth has come in areas that we know something about. We're tremendously excited about the last transaction we made. And this BP transaction, if you look at it in terms of what we have been able to do for a living for a lot of years, this is right in the wheelhouse.</p>
          <p>Next slide. This is what our financing plan is. I'm going to go over it briefly. I've been told we can't talk about the financing. But this is a cursory look of our plan going forward. We'll use a billion and a half cash, commercial paper, a 364 day bank revolver and a term debt. And then we have common and mandatory converts coming out tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Next slide. This is the financial impact. I will say that based on our numbers that we've run for 2011, because 2010, depending on when they close, it's hard to figure 2010. But for 2011, this is a push on earnings and it's slightly accretive both to cash flow and to reserves per share and production per share. You can see the BP businesses acquired. That is for half a year in terms of the revenues less expenses, 365 to $400 million. So if you double that, that's we think over 800.</p>
          <p>And if you look at our evaluation, we've got $300 million worth of capital that we're going to spend in 2011. Obviously, we're going to have a lot more cash flow to spend on these properties than we've dialed in so far. It does improve our reserve life a little bit. In terms of our product mix, it doesn't change our product mix at all. I've had a number of questions from our folks internally about, this is predominantly gas. If you look at our price deck, we don't get above $6.00, or we don't get to $6.00 in our price deck until 2014. So actually, it's probably not a bad time to buy gas.</p>
          <p>Next slide. This is a little of our own propaganda, frankly, because growth for growth's sake is not what we're about. But it does show what this transaction does in terms of our production against our peers, and our proved reserves against our peers and our proved reserves against our peers. So we obviously have taken a step change with this transaction. Thanks a lot.</p>
          <p>Our former chairman and founder used to say it's -- Apache's main business is following a cow through the corn fields. And we can get fat on the scraps that are left. The good thing about this transaction is that we're eating the corn this time. I mean, this is a very good transaction for Apache. And I think with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for the call today and just all the color that you put out in the presentation. I'm sure it will be helpful once we can digest it all. Just on the CapEx side, I think you mentioned a $300 million CapEx for the acquired assets. But I really wasn't sure exactly what context that was in. And my question really is what does your CapEx budget look like for the rest of 2010? And then in 2011 if you've had time to work through that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of what I was trying to intimate is that in terms of being able to come up with this value we've hardly dialed anything in this <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of future value. The $300 million is to finish the -- basically to finish the Noel drilling and do some drilling in the Permian Basin on that Yeso stuff and some Spraberry. But in terms of the capital, actual capital that we'll spend in 2011 on these properties, frankly, we're going to have to get our regions down in the middle of this and compare these properties to some of the things that we're doing ourselves. Plus we're going to have the capacity to gear up our capital from where we are today.</p>
          <p>We're projecting we're going to spend about three and a half, 3.3, $6.3 billion this year. That will probably go up some. But we've really got, I mean first thing we've got to do is close these. And Hart-Scott-Rodino is 30 days. And then time we get the approvals out of Canada and certainly out of Egypt, it's going to be 60 to 90 days before we can actually get in the middle of these transactions. So it's -- trying to project what 2010 capital is today is going to be pretty difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Page 7, where you went through the different value estimates. Just what was the price deck that you used in that long-term &#x2013; as a long-term price deck for those estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on Page 7 of the presentation on the different estimates of value, what is the price deck behind those numbers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a strip. I mean if you look on &#x2013; if you look at the gas strip and the oil strip, it doesn't...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the July '09 strips. And it started at $77 a barrel and 4.67 per Mcf and as Steve indicated it &#x2013; on the Mcf side, it doesn't go over $6 until 2014. In 2014, oil price strip was 84.40. So that'll give you some sense of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And since you guys are buying pretty much the entire business units for the three regions, will all of the prep rights also transfer that may be within those regions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question is just, there was just a ton of chatter you guys know and you potentially picking up the BP Alaska assets including Prudhoe Bay. What's the status of that if there was any status to start with? Or could we see any additional acquisitions from BP this year from you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I will tell you there was an awful lot of chatter and there was also an awful lot of asset mixes being thrown around. The one thing I would say is we picked this asset mix. In terms of our future, I didn't anticipate this one. So if it hadn't have been for the Gulf of Mexico incident, we probably &#x2013; well I'm sure we wouldn't have been sitting here tonight.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to get an update on the Mariner deal. I know you're going to be issuing stock; I just saw the release that you're going to be issuing shares and preferred for this deal. You also have a stock component for the Mariner deal. So just wanted to find out what impact that you feel that's going to have, especially as you're getting closer to completing the Mariner deal and just secondary in relation to the Mariner deal, just any update on the SEC and final proxy coming out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't think it should have any effect on Mariner whatsoever. But that &#x2013; we're filing the necessary regulatory papers and that will close in due course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Are there any synergies between BP's Montney properties that you're acquiring and your Horn River properties? If there are, will the acquisition affect in any way the year plan development of your Horn River project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it really shouldn't. Horn River is quite a bit further up to the northwest. But one thing that both the Noel and the Montney give us is some alternatives for our Kitimat project. We're continuing to exploit our Horn River and we've got a number of drills. We've got a plan this year and we'll have a plan next year. But in terms of a long-term outlook supplying gas to Kitimat, because of the logistics of where the Montney is, it could give us alternatives of taking gas west, as opposed to taking it south and east.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Great, thanks. And then just taking a step back from macro perspective with the combination of joint ventures that we've seen and then yourselves buying undercapitalized properties and likely increasing activity in the North American onshore from the majors, how are you thinking about both the macro environment for both natural gas and NGL here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I continue to think that we have an awful lot of gas in this country, which is a little bit of my statement earlier today. I think you have &#x2013; in areas that you can buy gas at this price you're much better off. And I don't mean this bad, but buying gas two or three years ago, not unlike what we did with Pioneer when we bought them out of Argentina, frankly. But we're seeing 4 and $5 gas prices in Argentina today.</p>
          <p>And I think over time, this country will have to transfer to natural gas. I think that's a foregone conclusion. Whether this administration accepts that or not, we're going to use natural gas in this country for a long time, and we're a long-term believer in natural gas as an American as first and as a producer second.</p>
          <p>In terms of what the outlook for natural gas prices are, if you look at that strip, I think that is probably indicative of what you're going to see. I think we've seen the high prices out of it, and we've seen some lower prices and I think we're starting to get an equilibrium.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Congrats on the acquisition, first off. Most of the questions have been asked, but does it matter how the $7 billion is allocated from your perspective, is there anything as it relates to production sharing agreements? Any color you can give me there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, we put on there the way we saw them, in terms of values. You know, in terms of long-term upside, I think honestly they all bring something different to the table. If you look at the Permian in the past, we focused on the oil side, and the reason is, is because oil was at $80 a barrel. We'll continue to do that. One of the reasons that we decided at the beginning of the year to open an office out there long before we had dreams of where we'd be today, it was to really focus on some of our old water floods. We've been very successful in drilling horizontal wells in there. We think we've got a whole program of drilling horizontal wells in old water fields, we drilled six today. John?</p>
          <p>Six to date, all of them are tremendously economic. The best ones are doing 300 barrels a day, and I will tell you, at 300 barrels a day, you can make a hell of a lot of money, regardless of how much water you have to move. But, each one of these areas brings something different. In Canada, you know, we have an awful lot of vintage wells. I will tell you, out of this package, probably next year sometime will come a rationalization package out of Canada, because we have an awful lot of stuff, smaller stuff, in Alberta that we'll probably decide that doesn't fit our portfolio anymore, but we'll just have to wait until we get there and see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, one more question specific to the Permian. You mentioned the tightness in the Granite Wash, obviously. Bakken, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, everything seems to be tight. What are you seeing on the Permian as far as rig availability, frac crews, et cetera?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the same issue still applies. Frac crews tend to be a little bit tight. We're seeing service companies are not bringing some of their entire frac fleet on board, probably because it's going to require them to hire some more people, and they just went through a down cycle last year, so how long it takes to bring them out of that, I don't know for sure, and I guess the other piece though you should keep in mind is, we're now drilling a well, and then we're fracking it 8 or 10 times so we got a lot more use of the frac crews on a per-well basis than we used to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the call. I just had a question about the 300 million of CapEx on the properties you're acquiring. Will those be primarily, I guess, does that assume sort of a current run rate of activity, or will there be an increase <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try to re-emphasize that. The $300 million are simply what we put in this acquisition when we evaluated it. I don't want to give the impression that will be how much money we spend on these properties next year. What is was is the way that the evaluation was put together in terms of the value that we delivered to BP, not in terms of the value that we seek for Apache going forward. Because I would hope we'll be spending multiples of that on these properties over the next several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd add to that, if you think back to Steve's comments about a push on earnings per share and slightly accretive to production per share or reserves per share and cash flow. Basically we're over laying a major plan for capital on our own. So we haven't kind of applied the Apache magic or whatever you want to call it to these properties. The fact that they &#x2013; half a year's cash flow, if you will, was $400 million and you can perhaps double that for a full year and yet the capital expenditures are only 300 million, it's pretty indicative of the kind of lack in investment that there was for these properties. So I think what we all sense here at Apache is that there's a lot of potential to do on these properties what we've done repeatedly on other packages from majors in the past, and that is add value by doing work over the big completions and exploration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other thing &#x2013; it's a little bit like &#x2013; I'm going to bring up a field that we bought from BP several years ago, it's called Forties. And it obviously &#x2013; it's in the water and it's in a different part of the world. But when we bought that, we evaluated 146 million barrels. In March of this year we produced 146 million barrels since we bought it. We have 175 million barrels of proven reserves on the books and we're producing 68,000 barrels of oil per day. And the point is, is that it's not that BP didn't recognize that. In the field studies that we've had the opportunity to look at within BP, they had tremendous amount of opportunities.</p>
          <p>They've indicated they have resources of about 1.6 billion barrels on these properties. We got the &#x2013; that was a BP estimate. We're not making any indication that that's what we believe. But my point is they have worked these properties. They're individual people are not unlike what we saw in Forties. They had a lot of good ideas, they just couldn't get funded. And we're going to take their ideas and our ideas and we're going to fund them, which is going to give us &#x2013; hopefully, it's going to give us an opportunity to really accelerate not only what we've bought but also to find new stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And I guess, is &#x2013; can you talk about Egypt? Are the targets there in your 2P, 3P numbers, are they primarily gas? Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually they're both. If you looked at that little chart, that was a &#x2013; that showed the BED Field and the VEGAS field there, both of those are high gas condensate, basically. They produce a lot of gas but they also produce a tremendous amount of liquids, not unlike what we're seeing in the Jurassic &#x2013; both of those fields are out of the Jurassic. And it's interesting because in your appendix, you will see an outline of the different plate types, the Bahariya and the Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous AEB and then the Jurassic. But that area right circling that is very, very rich source rock. It's a big hole out there, really. And what you're doing is coming out of that basin up onto the platform. But you get oil from 6,500 feet to 15, 16,000 feet in that area.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's really very prolific area. I mean I &#x2013; and hopefully we'll be able to show you that over time. But that's a beautiful area from a geological standpoint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These properties are essentially under explored in the deeper horizon that is below the traditional phase in the Bahariya and the Kharita and will have these low line formations. They are spun out of oil production associated with these development releases as well as gas. They are good water <mark type="inaudible" /> opportunities for these properties which I think probably was drilled on one of the development leases but their project was brought into full-scale development. So there's good opportunities for that secondary recovery, lots of infield drilling potential, down spacing of some of the fields compared with what we normally do at our operations in <mark type="inaudible" />  in the Bahariya formation that provide multiple exploitation opportunities as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I can't over-emphasize, one of the problems with that slide, if we had 400,000 acres in the Permian Basin, everybody would go, God you've got 400,000 acres. But because of our already existing position out there, it doesn't look very big, but that's a huge area. Those little red areas is a huge area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another thing that's interesting about Egypt is, as most of you know, we've found so much gas there that we've filled up the infrastructure in the Western Desert. Steve alluded to this, but they've got a gas line that you can see on that chart that is underutilized. It's got 100 million a day of capacity. We've got more than 100 million a day bottled up waiting for infrastructure, so that's something that our guys are going to look very closely at and quickly, and we hope to bring that online before too long.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a few questions here, you don't hedge as much in the past. Do you expect to re-visit that strategy going forward now that you're layering on these volumes, and with some of the recent transactions that are still pending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first thing I'd said is we've got authorization to hedge, and we've got some time to think it through because these things are closing over a period of months. But I think Steve kind of indicated what our thoughts are with respect to hedging. We were basically dormant on the acquisition front while gas was at 7, 8, 9, 10 bucks an Mcf.</p>
          <p>Now that we're down to these levels where gas on a strip and what we're using to value these properties, it doesn't rise above $6 for basically five years. We think a lot of the downside's already been taken out by the market. So we don't feel compelled at these prices to rush out there and hedge. That having been said, we'll take a look as time goes by. But at least at this point, we have no plans to hedge the gas, and two-thirds of the production is gas. So that's really the relevant commodity in this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. I might have missed this, but the 364 day bank facility and the term debt &#x2013; or I'm sorry, the commercial paper balance, do you plan to generate enough free cash flow in the next year or so to pay those down? Is that the plan?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Didn't realize I was going over that line, but that's no problem. And then just in the Gulf of Mexico looks like you were one of the first to receive a permit and are drilling on the shelf. Can you give us an update on what you're hearing or seeing with respect to the permitting process out there?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>We are starting to get some permits through, but it continues to be slow. The intermix BOE are still going through some teething problems and getting set up with their new organization as you can imagine. So we are expecting delays in virtually everything, but we are able to move forward on our Gulf of Mexico program that Apache itself had. The Mariner piece is still being held up on a number of fronts and we're just hoping for near-term success, but still some holdups.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last one, I'm not sure who best to address. But some interesting proposals coming out of Washington these days on some policy and regulatory fronts on the heels, not just dealing with the Gulf of Mexico but also some things impacting onshore. Can you just give us your thoughts on how any of those proposals might affect doing business here in the States going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, luckily they're still proposals. I'd rather not comment, and the reason is is that I think it's &#x2013; I'm a big believer that in the end cool heads will prevail, certainly on the fracture, hydraulic fracturing front. Apache is a member of ANGA and I happen to be on that executive board of ANGA. And there's been an awful lot of work and a lot of interaction with the people that are writing some of those bills. At least our expectation is is that we'll get something reasonable out of that, but you can never be sure today.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Part of the real attraction to this play is Yeso out there on the edge of the reef, but there's additional anchorage in the Bone Springs and in the Abo.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great and then just one last question with respect to the midstream assets that you're picking up, obviously with the exception of maybe Egypt, are those things that you would be looking at monetizing at one point or another? Or is the intention to hold on to those, just because it's strategically advantage with you, and maybe a tight liquids market, who knows what.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the one in Egypt we've been coveting since 1997. So it's going to be a very strategic integral part of our plans in Egypt. And the ones in the Permian Basin are very both integral to the liquids we yield associated with our production there. So those are strategic in that regard. In Canada, we're just going to have to look at. I doubt if we'd sell or monetize any of those plants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they're fairly modest plants in Canada as a general rule and really starting with producing assets through there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you guys, very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Philip Dodge with Tuohy Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just going back to Egypt, at your June meeting, you set a five year target of increasing your production there 50%, as I recall. Would it be fair in our work to assume that you might be able to exceed that now or has this kind of transaction or something like it been factored into that goal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we set the goal on June 16 at our analyst's meeting after achieving our two tons production plan for 2005 and doubling our production to 332,000 barrels a day. We announced that meeting we set a new goal for ourselves to add 100,000 barrels a day gross production to 425,000 barrels a day by &#x2013; that's in a five-year period. At that time, of course, this transaction was not envisioned. So we have to incorporate that in our new plan. So I would say, based on this acquisition, we certainly have a better chance of achieving and exceeding that goal, if not revising it accordingly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just wanted to confirm that. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Our final question comes from the line of Sam Sandof with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the question. This is Sam's colleague, <mark type="inaudible" />. I was just wondering if there was an opportunity to consolidate the upcoming Mariner purchase with some deepwater assets from BP at a great price. And if that was actually offered, what was the deterrent from deepwater and what led you to handpick the assets that you originally did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of these assets we've -- you know one of the things in our history, is Apache has been very acquisitive. Certainly the Egyptian assets have fit us for a number of years and the Permian assets and the Canadian assets. Certainly the Permian assets was not the first time we've had that discussion and in Canada, it is really the outcrop of what we've been doing up there lately in terms of the Horn River and that kind of stuff. It really gives us an opportunity to really exploit those properties. So...</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, but what about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the deepwater, it was never discussed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And your views on increasing the liability cap to 10 billion. Has that been getting support behind the scenes? Any update on that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think that's been discussed and I think the industry has proposals whereby maybe there'd be in effect a sinking fund so that the tax that we paid, or used to pay as an industry on all barrels produced in the U.S. to fund the environmental fund if you will, after the Valdez. There is now a proposal that the amount per barrel be increased modestly. But it's on enough barrels that it would stack up pretty rapidly until that fund goes from, my recollection, about a billion and a half to $10 billion. In effect, it would be like an insurance fund if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we don't have any inside knowledge on what's going to transpire there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So picking up deepwater this time around from BP was not in the cards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it wasn't. It wasn't even thought about frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is there a reason for that? Is there a reason why you wouldn't be interested in their deepwater assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have deepwater assets with Mariner. We've got almost 100 blocks so we're...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the beauty of this one is that some might wonder about this many acquisitions this quickly, but this is in three -- the Mariner deal was in one region. These are all in three separate regions so integration ought to go very well even for an acquisition of this size.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We think it's a great deal for Apache. And we look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow.</p>
