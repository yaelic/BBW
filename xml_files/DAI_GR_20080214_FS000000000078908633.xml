          <p>Good afternoon from Stuttgart, this is Friedrich Lauer from Daimler Investor Relations. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our full-year results call.</p>
          <p>We are happy to have with us today the Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler and Head of Mercedes Benz Cars, Dr. Dieter Zetsche; the Head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler; and the Chief Financial Officer, Bodo Uebber. In order to give you maximum time for your questions, Dr. Dieter and Mr. Uebber will begin the conference with a short introduction which will be directly followed by a Q&amp;A session.

        <plist>
          <p>Gentleman &#x2013; new attempt, thanks Friedrich. Ladies and gentleman, for us 2007 was a crucial year that set our course for the future. We clearly defined our strategic focus within the group and in our in our businesses. We sold our majority share in Chrysler and that significantly reduced our risk exposure. We set ambitious financial goals for all of our business operations. We substantially improved our profitability. We made considerable progress on the road to sustainable mobility. We made our organization faster and more empowered. We further optimized our net assets by selling real estate holdings, and finally we laid the foundation for a high performance culture.</p>
          <p>Our EBIT was significantly higher than in 2006 and higher than our target of at least &#x20AC;8.5 billion. Despite the financial burdens associated with the de-merger from Chrysler, our net profit was higher than in the previous year. This shows just how much we've improved our operations. We will share our successes with our shareholders. We propose paying out a dividend of &#x20AC;2 per share for 2007. That's an increase of one-third over the previous year. At the same we continue our share buyback program as of today. We have a successful year behind us, and we're optimistic that despite some difficult market conditions, the year ahead will be successful too because all of our business operations are running well.</p>
          <p>At Mercedes-Benz Cars, we sold a record number of vehicles despite a difficult market environment. At the same time, we significantly increased our return on sales to 9.1%. We aim to do even better in the future by achieving the average return on sales of 10% by 2010 at the latest.</p>
          <p>We continued to improve our productivity. In 2006, we increased productivity by 12% and last year we improved it by another 10%. In the coming years, we will continue the improvements by an additional 10 to 15% depending on the model series. We plan to expand on a regional basis and to continuously further improve our product quality. We aim to appeal to our customers' emotions and we have got the right products for that, both on the road and in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>In the next two years, we are going to launch a whole series of new products. In 2008 alone, we will introduce two new and six updated models to the market. At Daimler Trucks, we proved that our management of market cycles works. For the first time ever in a downturn market and in spite of dramatic market declines in the US and Japan, our truck division not only stayed profitable, but even exceeded last year's good result with an EBIT of &#x20AC;2.1 billion and a return on sales of 7.5%. This success was mainly due to the outstanding results posted by Mercedes-Benz Trucks whose business in Europe and Latin America further improved to excellent levels. That's another reason why we've raised our return on sales target from 7 to 8% starting 2010 as an average across the market cycle for Trucks. We aim to achieve this goal through the consistent continuation of our Global Excellence Program. The big highlight in 2008 will be the new Actros, our flagship model, and also the best selling heavy-duty truck in Europe. To sum things up, Daimler Trucks is right on track.</p>
          <p>At Mercedes-Benz Vans, we set a new sales record in 2007 and significantly increased our profitability. High demand for the Sprinter has led to full utilization of our production capacity. We will further enhance our Van production efficiency in 2008. At the same time, we'll also expand our production capacity.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses once again posted increased sales and set a benchmark for profitability. We plan to maintain this position by continuing our product offensive in Europe, strengthening our position in growth markets, and further consolidating our leadership in Alternative Drive Systems.</p>
          <p>Let me add here that both Vans and Buses generated considerably higher earnings in 2007 compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services posted a 4.8 return on equity in spite of the high cost of building up a new NAFTA organization, a move that was necessary after the separation from Chrysler Financial. On the whole, our Financial Services business is also developing in a stable and positive manner. What's more, our proven risk management system will ensure that this remains the case despite the current market turbulences.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services business still offers promising growth opportunities, for example in the insurance and fleet management sectors. Daimler Financial Services, therefore, remains a key pillar of our growth strategy. This brief overview shows that we've achieved a great deal at the group level and in each of our business areas. Still it is clear that we cannot and will not simply sit back and relax. That's why we are confident with regard to our business developments in 2008 and the following years. At Mercedes-Benz Cars, we aim to top the sales record we set in 2007. At Daimler Trucks, we expect to see increasing sales in North America. We aim to slightly increase our sales in Europe, Latin America and Asia. For Mercedes-Benz Vans we anticipate a continued rise in unit sales while for Daimler Buses, we expect unit sales to remain stable overall.</p>
          <p>What will this mean for our earnings? At Mercedes-Benz Cars and Daimler Trucks, we expect to further increase our earnings. At Financial Services, we are confident that this year we can once again achieve an average return on equity of at least 14%. In line with expectation of our divisions, we anticipate that Daimler Group's EBIT for 2008 from ongoing operations will clearly exceed the levels reached in 2007. The results for 2007 included income from the transfer of shares in EADS and financial burdens due to Chrysler and NMM.</p>
          <p>Overall we aim to achieve a 9% average return on sales in our automotive business across our market and product cycles from 2010 at the latest. Of course, we know that the global economic environment has become more difficult and we are aware of the related risks. Nonetheless we expect to achieve our goals because we have the right strategy, because we have the operational strength we need, and because our position in the Financial Services business is adequately conservative. We will further intensify our efforts in safety and sustainable mobility. That's why Daimler will once again move forward in 2008.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to hand over to Bodo Uebber. I look forward to our discussions later on. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dieter. Ladies and gentlemen, Dieter Zetsche has briefly explained to you last year's business development of each of our divisions and our outlook for the future. I would now like to focus on the key figures of our financial statements, which are preliminary and not yet audited. Daimler's EBIT, which solely reflects the continuing operations, increased compared to the prior year by a substantial 3.7 billion to &#x20AC;8.7 billion. So we surpassed our announced goal of at least 8.5 billion although we had to accept charges from Chrysler and EADS in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Net profit improved by 5% to &#x20AC;4 billion, it includes charges of &#x20AC;2.2 billion related to the Chrysler transaction. In terms of our continuing activities, we increased net profit by &#x20AC;1.7 billion to &#x20AC;4.9 billion. We can also report today on very solid results for the free cash flow of the industrial business at &#x20AC;7.6 billion, and for the net liquidity of the industrial business of &#x20AC;12.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is extremely strong as indicated by an equity ratio of more than 40% for our industrial business. Our cost liquidity of &#x20AC;17.1 billion was at an extremely high level as a result of transferring the refinancing of our Financial Services business to Cerberus. We will continue reducing it this year by repaying mature liabilities and through our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>This also applies to the net liquidity of the industrial business. In the medium term, we want to further optimize our capital structure. For this reason, we initiated a share buyback program in August 2007. In this context, we announced that we would apply &#x20AC; 7.5 billion to buyback up to 10% of our own shares. Between the end of August and the middle of 2007, we acquired 50 million shares worth &#x20AC;3.5 billion. These shares were canceled by the end of the year. We will resume the share buyback program already today. The program is based on the retained earnings in the parent company's financial statements, which amounted to &#x20AC;3.5 billion at the end of 2006, which were used to buyback shares in 2007.</p>
          <p>In the financial statements for 2007, Daimler AG we reported net profit of &#x20AC;12.4 billion. As allowed by the German Stock Corporation Act, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, we'll transfer half of that to retained earnings. This is equivalent to &#x20AC;6.2 billion. After deducting the proposed dividend of &#x20AC;2 billion, an amount of &#x20AC;4.2 billion remains. With the approval of the shareholders at the Annual Meeting in April, we will transfer this amount to retained earnings as well. This will provide us with sufficient resources to buyback more shares.</p>
          <p>The very high net profit of Daimler AG is a result on the one hand of the good business development, and Mercedes-Benz Cars and Daimler Trucks. On the other hand, the parent company received dividend payouts from its foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we realized gains on the sale of EADS shares and on the transfer of investments.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. We will now be glad to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Dr. Zetsche and Mr. Uebber. Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now. I will identify the questionnaire by name, but please also introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization that you're representing before asking your questions. Two practical points, firstly please avoid using a mobile phone, as this disturbs the quality of the call for everyone, and secondly please ask your question in English. Before we start the session, the Operator will explain the procedure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take the first question today from John Lawson please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon, John Lawson from Citi. Two points if I may, firstly you've included Vans and Buses I think in auto margins target for the first time. I guess there are some of us out here who've tried to deconstruct the Van, Bus, and Other segment. And know how difficulty it is to tease-out underlying Van and Bus profit numbers, at least it was in 2007. So can you put us out of our misery please and reveal the '07 margin performance of Vans and Buses? That's the first question. Second one is that I noticed the R&amp;D capitalization is going up, but the amortization is flat or even going slightly down. I mean are you entering a phase where capitalization is going to be much higher? I think in the past, this hasn't seemed to be something that was on the horizon for you. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, to your first question, our policy is to disclose the segment profitabilities on the one hand that is Mercedes-Benz Cars and on the another hand, it is Daimler Trucks, and then Financial Services, and the so-called VBO segment, which is Van, Bus and Others. I do accept that it is difficult to extract the profitability of the two &#x2013; of Van and Buses. As we've already said we will think about a disclosure change during the course of the year, especially related to Vans and Bus. So in this regard, you don't see this number exactly. We have in our automotive target which Dieter Zetsche this morning explained we have summarized Mercedes-Benz Cars, Daimler Trucks, the Van and the Bus business, which amounts to roughly 8% in the actuals of 2007. And if you make the equation of the revenues in this amount which is roughly 13.5 billion. You get to a somewhat average margin for the Van and Bus business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the &#x2013; your second question of the R&amp;D capitalization, yes it is right that we have an increase in capitalization ratios which are roughly right now 27, 25% in both businesses. That holds true for Daimler Trucks and also for Mercedes-Benz Cars, and which relates to certain project of course and timings. And that was an increase compared to 2005 and 2006. And I expect this number to slightly increase further during the course of the next years. And Dieter Zetsche already said this morning that we have also in the R&amp;D sector due to the investments we need to do for CO2 and other related technologies, an increase in R&amp;D of maximum 1% of revenues in MBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that even with that slight increase we are at the low end of the spectrum of our peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is absolutely right. All our peers are north or far north of 30%, so we are in this regard, absolutely right, very conservative so to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that 1% increase is based on the cash R&amp;D spend I take it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That 1% is based on the cash R&amp;D, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question from Jurgen Geiger please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have three questions, if I may. Dr. Zetsche, with regards to the 10% average Mercedes target, you're with the company now since 30 years. And I think it's fair to say that Mercedes has never delivered such performance. Could you maybe share with us the main thoughts, what has changed at Mercedes that you think that we are seeing such a structural uplift in average margins for Mercedes? Second, with regards to Trucks, we all noticed you lifted your target to 8% average EBIT margin. I wonder whether you could share also your thoughts here. Why you do that at that point in time especially once the market is worrying about certainly more difficult economic environment. And lastly with regards to Chrysler, could you clarify the situation in the event that Chrysler LLC would require further money, can they bank on Daimler, or can they not bank on Daimler? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question is concerned, I am glad that you didn't ask why we don't go for 20% or 30%, but for 10%. I agree with your assessment that looking to our peers and to our history, it's an ambitious target we are setting ourselves. My assessment is that in the past as today, we were striving for superior vehicles, success with our customers, and we were successful in this regard. We were less focused on operational excellence. I think that is a fact. And with a very strong focus on the one hand continuing to benefit from the high revenues per unit based on our good customer base, which we're enjoying. Hence, now on the other hand, the strive for benchmark position in our cost position, we opened this possibility of margins of 10%. We will face and we're already facing significant challenges not just from exchange rates and raw materials like anybody else, but certainly from the CO2 challenge as well. We are aware of that, and we have some homework to do in order to deliver on the CO2 challenge and at the same time maintain margins of 10% as promised. But we feel confident that we will be able to solve that request.</p>
          <p>Let me jump to the Chrysler question because afterwards I would relate to Andreas because of course this target hasn't come from me, but it's his own assessment of his business I guess.</p>
          <p>Chrysler LLC, we have a clear contract and which are defining the transaction. You know the commitments, which are included in those contracts as far as warranties or guarantees are concerned, or our pension funds, other issues. They are all transparent and public. Other than that, there are no obligations, legal or moral from Daimler towards Chrysler. Andreas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take your question. Why are we now increasing our average profitability target to 8%? As you know, we said we are striving for the bigger than 7%. But we also said that last year we will have for the first time kind of proof of our strategy managing the cycles because as you know we had a downturn in the United States of &#x2013; in the Class 8 of over 40%. Like we always said and also in Japan, we had a minus of 25%. Despite this downturn, we were able to deliver profitability, and as Dieter Zetsche mentioned today in the morning, all our divisions also in North America and Asia were positive profitable wise. So that makes us very confident that we can now achieve what we always have said. And that was the reason that we said, now it's time to think where we are, what is the potential with all of the on going projects. And we said okay, it looks that we are now much more confident to go to the 8%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thank you. Just two questions please. On the 2007 financials, I think one of interesting things is just how low both the CapEx spend for the Group is and the depreciation charge for the Group once we ex out Chrysler. And I think what a lot of us are wondering is have you found some sort of new approach versus your peers? I mean you talked earlier about R&amp;D, but in your approach versus your peers in running CapEx and depreciation at such low levels, depreciation looks like its 2.5% of Group revenues. Is this level sustainable? And given some of the talk of an extra small car plant in East Europe etcetera, what sort of CapEx number and depreciation figure as a percentage of sales should we be thinking about long-term? That's the first question. And then the second question comes back to Jurgen Geiger's question on Chrysler. Dr. Zetsche, you said that Daimler has no legal or moral responsibility. But could you say categorically, could you, I think you said this last year on the legal side, could you just say there is absolutely no circumstances in which Daimler would put in any extra debt guarantees or funding into Chrysler in the coming years? I think that would be very helpful for all of us. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to your second question, I can answer that question being asked by everyone of the following colleagues of yours with a clear, yes, there are no further augments or anything. Was that clear enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful, and on the depreciation and CapEx side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just make one comment and then hand over to Bodo. The one comment is that or two comments. The first one is that doing the core program, and in the same sense, the supplies for Trucks as well, we have certainly improved our efficiency of capital investments as well, so we are getting more out of less. But on the Mercedes side, in accordance with the even further increased activities regarding CO2 emission reductions, we see the possibility of an increase of the CapEx rate for Mercedes of up to 1 percentage point. Very much similar to the FE rate or ratio which might see a similar increase of up to 1 percentage point. That's of course built into our plans for the next three years within our operative planning, and not a surprise. But talking about the absolute levels, Bodo will come back to you right away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the CapEx, we have talked about the R&amp;D ratio, for the CapEx ratio, the situation will be somewhat the same. In 2007, we had a 3.6% CapEx ratio for Mercedes-Benz Cars. And that will go up in 2008 and 9 with 1%. Ratio on the Group level, it will be somewhat the same. Within Trucks, it is based on next year, next year we will see the kind of peak in investments due to the investments in medium duty engine and the future platform of trucks. And then it will go down again, so overall we will see in '08 a 1% increase. For the depreciation, the effect which we have seen this year is based on our &#x2013; that we use our production tooling and architectures for two platforms or longer, which is a decrease. It will certainly, by the CapEx and the other stuff, also somewhat increase in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Actually, can I just have one follow up question on Chrysler, and it's nothing contentious at all. It's just looking at your guidance, you're saying you expect to post EBIT from continuing operations well above the prior year level. But obviously at the moment, we have Chrysler in the reported operating profit, I think that might move, but we are going to have 20% of Chrysler's loss. I mean do you have any ability to forecast how much Chrysler will lose in '08? I mean what kind of guidance can you give us, what would your advice be to analysts in terms of trying to forecast what that equity loss will be in the accounts this year and going forward, that would be really helpful? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good evening, Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley. Two questions on the Financial Services business. First, can you quantify the magnitude of the organizational change costs at Financial Services? It still looks like it's weighing on the fourth quarter. Can you give us an idea of when that starts to alleviate in terms of whether Q1, we can start to see a step change? We understand there is a lot going on there, but it does appear to be still depressing the profit there. And also can you disclose the risk loss ratio that you have on Mercedes and/or Trucks? So if you could be specific, the global risk loss ratio that you're provisioning for now and how that increased or presumably increased from '06. And if you can give us a bit of detail in terms of quarter-by-quarter because I understand you view these things on quarterly basis, what the trend has been towards the latter part of 2007? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Adam, hello Adam. So only a few questions you have. Regarding the Financial Services business of course we had in 2007 separation effects, de-merger effects, especially in the third and the first quarter. We have made the legal separation in August. We have made the &#x2013; we've applied for licensees in October, which we've gotten. Now we can do our own business so to say on, but we're using the systems, the IT system and some transition service level agreements from Chrysler Financial. This we will separate in mid of April. So we will have these impacts in the first and the second quarter in minimum and of course in parallel we will look for measures how to get back to our number one position in terms of efficiency. So that will be then an ongoing task. So at minimum, the expenses related to this subject will occur in the first and the second quarters.</p>
          <p>Then your questions regarding the cost of risk and delinquency development in 2007, that was pretty much related to the last quarter. We have slightly upward trends in this aspect. On the one hand in the Mercedes-Benz passenger car business, but also in the Truck business that reflects not that we are in subprime to say that clearly. But of course, the cooling down of the industry has its impact also on our risk ratios slightly and we are far away from the long-term average trends, which we have seen in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wait a minute. Does that &#x2013; sorry just to clarify, does that imply that you are far away from average trends that you're still below the long-term average trends?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question from Arndt Ellinghorst please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. A question on CO2. I mean there is a lot of talk now about the R&amp;D cost impact from the CO2 issue. I guess we sit probably next year together and talk about the material cost impact, that it takes from adding all the different technologies to become more fuel efficient finally. Could you share some of your views regarding the costs associated really from adopting new technologies to make your engines more fuel efficient? It would be an assumption of something between 30 to &#x20AC;40 per gram per car, an assumption that we could take, firstly?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on your revenues per unit at Mercedes in the final quarter of last year, I think it dropped by roughly 12% on the back of increased C Class and smart sales and also currency. Could you share some of your views regarding contribution margin on the products that you're newly launching? And I guess we were told earlier that material &#x2013; that cost of producing the new C-Class is something 20 to 25% below the old version. Could you give us some light for your new products moving forward and also the new E-Class next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as CO2 is concerned, I consider it impossible to give you a euro per gram indication because these costs are progressive. What that means is that the first gram is almost for free, and the next five grams are costing something, and the next grams are more expensive, and the last grams are the most expensive one. So which just means that you can work on just a better energy management. And then you can come to things like start/stop or low-resistance tires, and then you go on to direct injection second generation for gasoline engines, and turbochargers and ultimately end up with a hybrid component. And all of these units have progressive cost per fuel saving. And therefore, it very much depends on the final definition of the legislation, and that's not the only requirement. On top of that, we have the CO2 taxes with different limitations and different countries, we have metropolitan areas and all of that. But at the end of the day, it very much depends on how far you have to go to define the average cost you have to add to the variable of your vehicles. And therefore, we just can't give you a more precise answer before we know what we finally have to do. But of course, we have very clear ideas if the average has to go to X, and this is what we have to spend, when it goes to Y, that's what we have to do then.</p>
          <p>But I think it's fair to say what you said that by this time next year we have much more transparent discussions just because we know the framework much better. As far as the average revenues per unit is concerned, you mentioned some of the impacts, you did not mention some others. And significant one for instance being used car sales, especially in the fourth quarter of 2006. We very much cleared out a significant inventory of used cars, which we didn't have to do this year because we were at historically low levels. So that reduction in revenues, if you want, which you then divide by the new car sales even though they have nothing to do with it, then we have different levels of leasing ratios. In leasing, obviously we get only about a third depending on how long it is, a third of the revenues. And if this share increases, then the revenues per unit go down. So there are multiple effects structurally we have not seen a significant deterioration of our mix in new car sales altogether. Just say, Bodo is showing figures to me...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, but year-over-year if you look at the year-over-year development, it's not minus 12%, it's minus 1%. And that reflects what Dieter Zetsche said, currency, used car, and also the leasing penetration. And then it fluctuates sometimes in the quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now as far as the new C-Class is concerned, it's always important what you relate to. When we for instance look at the cost of the last generation C-Class when we introduced it. And then at the time when we decided about the successor model, at that time we defined a certain amount of cost reduction for the new model, which was very, very significant. But till the launch of the new model, we significantly reduced the cost of the old model through the core program and other aspects. So that at the time of launch the cost reduction from the old to the new model was lower than at the time of the decision. But in any case, the new model is meeting and exceeding our margin objectives we have set with this project. And therefore, we're very satisfied with accomplishments in this regard. And the same from today's perspective will apply to the new E-Class where we will see a significant improvement in the cost position as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I &#x2013; thank you very much. If I just may clarify on the CO2 issue, I mean you're sitting on the Board of the VDA of also within ACEA. Would it be fair to say that the industry so far has no real clue about the technology costs associated that are coming up within the next three or four years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that this is a fair assessment. We know exactly what those different components to the extent they are developed today are costing today. We have relatively good understanding what kind of cost reduction based on volume, based on further optimization can be accomplished within the next 3, 4, 5 years for those components. But as I said before, we don't know exactly how far we have to go in introducing expensive technologies. Of course, we try to get as far as possible with more cost efficient technologies, but not knowing the final legislation we don't know how far we have to go.</p>
          <p>I mean just to give you an idea when you talk about the hybridization of a product, you definitely talk about values which are somewhere, assuming that by higher volume and so on, you get scale effects when things are going down, something from 4,000 upwards euro per unit. So if you were to assume you would have to add that to every single unit, it's not difficult to calculate the effect. If you have to do that for 5% of the fleet, obviously you have the different impact. So those questions are more relevant than the question of whether it's 4,500 or &#x20AC;5,000 per unit. But our clear intention is on the one hand to use the most cost efficient technologies possibly, secondly to make the technologies we're working on more cost efficient than they are today. Thirdly, to leverage further productivity and efficiency potentials, which we have in our overall system, in order to offset cost increases coming from that source. And ultimately, to add something to our price tag at least based on the financial benefit over the life cycle the customer gains by a more fuel-efficient vehicle.</p>

          <p>The next question from Philippe Houchois please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Philippe Houchois from JPMorgan. I have two questions, the first one for Mr. Renschler. Six to nine months ago he was focused so much on Fuso, and no one talks about it anymore. Could you update us on the progress in the division in Japan as well because we had some surprisingly good GDP numbers recently? And if you're happy with the progress on that business as a continuing part of the Group?</p>
          <p>And Dr. Zetsche, if I could get more of a general answer from you, philosophically there has been a lot of noise recently about special DV versus current DV, and you have chosen to increase the current dividend. Can you give us what's your priority between share buyback, special dividend, current dividend as your preferred way of returning cash? And also if we're still looking at, you know, down the road, a benchmark of a payout ratio of around 40% which is what the DAX is telling us right now, I think Mr. Uebber had given us that number. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I'm starting with Fuso. So I will be sure that we are still working very intensively with Fuso and it's still on our attention. The progress was last year very good. I think despite the issue we had in the Japanese domestic market, the home market, it's minus 25%. We overcome this, Fuso was overall profitable and we had a good increase in the international market. So overall, basic sales volume could also increase slightly. So overall, we are working in the process, the integration comes further. As you know, if we are, when we started with Fuso and we said, okay, we have changed to put commonality parts around the world, including Fuso. We always said it needs time. So now we have the heavy-duty engine as one of the good examples we will launch this year or we will see it on the road this year in April with our customers at Freightliner, and step-by-step we will do the same with Fuso. So, we are very good, let's say we made good improvement last year. And we are on our track and our plans are coming through that Fuso will be a very good part of our overall global truck organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as dividends and other shareholder measures are concerned. I think we have to differentiate between two elements. One is the ongoing business with high margins and good cash flow. In this regard, we have made the statement that we want to be at benchmark levels of the return from these ongoing profits to our shareholders, and this is a dividend obviously. And secondly, there is the current situation of high net liquidity, and a non-leverage situation, where we have said that we want to develop our capital structure into a slightly leveraged capital structure, not the least looking at our cost of capital, the WACC, as a consequence. And this is one process, we intend to go through, and that's where we have to decide with what activities, we want to make that transition, as you know, our first decision was 10% buyback of stock. We would like not to finally define further steps at that point of time. But as we have listened to you and your colleagues in the first round, we will promise you to do so again for potential second round. And then make up our mind what is the best means and ways to hopefully satisfy you.</p>

          <p>Next question from Christian Breitsprecher please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. I have two questions, one also relating to the issue of cash distribution and buyback. I mean now that the share price is so low, is it conceivable that you complete the first round of the buyback basically until the AGM, then get authorization for another 10%, and then do that over the following 12 months. And the second question relates to the US dollar net exposure. So I think in the press conference you said that you have a net dollar exposure of 10 billion. I remember the number of 8 billion from previous conference calls. Can you just clarify whether that's really the net dollar exposure, whether this is just US or overall dollar exposure, I mean including Middle East and so on, a clarification of that number would be helpful? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Bodo has to answer the second question, you can start with the first question as well I guess, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the first question you had, I cannot promise you that we are finished before the annual meeting. But in that area, it might be, I don't know, close to that date. I don't know whether we will meet it let's say one day before. I cannot promise it, but maybe we try. And the amount will be roughly from today's point of view if you look at the share price and if you go to another 5%, we're talking about roughly &#x20AC;3 billion and of course we do that as quick as we can. The share price is now at this point of time it's 54, 53. It might be a good situation not to buy as many as we can. The exposure of 10 billion, I told you of course we have let's say exposure when you go back the last years, we have now an increased number of sales in the US. And this exposure of course increases somewhat. And therefore, I said this 10 billion of exposure it was in the last year roughly 9 billion. It goes up over 10 billion and that includes also as you said our sales to the Middle East, is included there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, Adam Hull at WestLB. Two questions, one was really just following on that comment on the buyback. But just to be clear, that means you could finish the previous plan, which was it 3 or 4 billion that's left? And then the next two, 4.2 billion and could all of that be done by the end of fiscal 2007? I mean just theoretically, is there anything stopping you potentially from doing that. And the second question is on Financial Services, we're getting a lot of questions on that area. I don't know if you could give us a little bit more of a sense of magnitude. From the outside it's very hard as you get a feel for this, but if you were to say your residual value assumptions were to fall by say one percentage point, say after three years from 45 to 44%. I don't know if you could give some order of magnitude as to what kind of an impact that would have under 100 million, under 500 million, just some order of magnitude? And actually finally, sorry three, just a little bit of an update on the timing of the savings on the sort of integration of your regional Truck businesses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way, your question to the residual values in the fourth quarter before I've given you your sensitivity here, we had a very good situation in the fourth quarter. So compared to the cost of risk in the finance area, the residuals developed very fine so we had a decrease of that burden in the fourth quarter which was slightly offsetting the costs of risk. I am not prepared right now to give you the sensitivities here of 1% up and down. And the first question to the Financial Services, can you repeat it, because I couldn't understand what you asked</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the other question was on the buyback. Just to be clear, I thought you had 4 billion left of the previous program. And I understand that you can carry that on and then you can ask for another 10% buyback, but you mentioned the 4.2 billion from the I think the AG retained profit. I just wanted to be clear, can I add both of those together and then I get up to 8.2 billion and could that theoretically be done within fiscal 2007, and is there are anything stopping you from potentially doing that theoretically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I try to explain it again to make it clear. We have decided on the share buyback of 7.5 billion. We have done up to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net of 10% which might be less than 7.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next off 7.5 billion, out of that we have done 3.5 billion in '07. And if you look at the share price of today to do another 5%, 5% we have done. And if you would do another 5% that would come up with roughly 3 billion. So the total program would then be just limited to 10% share-buyback would come up with 6.5 billion. That is one equation. The other one is the retained earnings area, where we have the amount, which we could do as in share-buyback. At the end of '06, we had 3.5 billion in retained earnings. This one we applied to a share-buyback. So the retained earnings as of '07 are at the beginning of '07 are a total of say zero, now we come up with a 12.4 billion profit of the DAG German GAAP profit. And if you now take the 12 billion minus our dividend, so we have new retained earnings for the year 2008 of 10 billion. Out of that we will...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we will only have the second part when the General Assembly allows us to use it that way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Dieter is very correct. That is only true when the Assembly, the general annual meeting will decide on that. So we have 6 billion out of the 10 for the first two of the annual meeting and another four when the annual meeting will decide on that. I hope they will do. Then we have this 10 billion, out of that we will apply 3 billion to our first share-buyback program. So we have another flexibility so to say of 7 billion after the Annual Meeting.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank. Dr. Zetsche, you recently said that you are currently not planning or thinking about the new plant in the NAFTA region. Is there a dollar rate when you would say such as step would be inevitable? And secondly, in the context, since the announcement of smart launch in the US, the dollar further deteriorated. Can this business or the smart still generate positive contributions in the US, at the current dollar rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer to the second question, whether clear yet. Since the decision on the introduction of smart in the US not only dollar rates have changed, but our price assumption and meanwhile our actual prices have changed comparatively upwards as well. The mix is much better than conservatively assumed in our business case, and option rates, the take rates are higher than conservatively assumed. So we are clearly in a good positive situation there.</p>
          <p>As far as plants are concerned, exchange rates obviously are one element defining the relative cost of different locations, but that's one element. And even more relevant to the cost position in any specific area is the supplier footprint, which is not very favorable in the US these days. So I could imagine that with the further deteriorating dollar, still considering logistics and many other issues, you might still be in better position if you would invest into plant capacity, to do that somewhere else than in the US. Because once again, in the end, it's not just a question of exposure, but it's a question at what cost you change this exposure percentage. And only if it's beneficial it makes sense to shift anything to the US. We have increased our capacity in the US recently with the R-Class and GL-Class in Tuscaloosa to something like 180, 190,000 unit capacity. And we have no plans at that point of time and not even looking at somewhat further potential deterioration of the dollar value to add to that in the US.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thank you. I've got a couple of questions, first on Chrysler, given the fact that this is not &#x2013; no longer a core business, but it is obviously affecting reported profit. I mean is there not a chance you could just write-off this investment and therefore you wouldn't have to show in equity account the profitability, get rid of the whole distortion there? The other question is on this whole CO2 challenge, clearly you have got some time to develop technologies and you already were developing technologies to meet it. But it seems as though in some markets the new taxes are already having quite an impact on the sales of cars in certain segments, and Renault was essentially just talking about that. So you're having a direct impact now on your sales? What impact is that having, can you just give us some more flavor of what the immediate impact on profitability is? And in some markets I'm told is almost frozen because you can't tell what the price of the car is because the taxes are so complicated? And given that fact, I mean I just wondered how you can be so confident to deliver these high margins in Mercedes with this very uncertain environment, both the economic one and the CO2 tax one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, to your first question, the answer is no. We have to apply the equity accounting on the book value of over 9 billion to Chrysler. So I am limited to that and to the accounting standard of IFRS. So the answer is no, I cannot do this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your second question, certainly you are right that very public and visible discussion about future CO2 legislation from Brussels. That somewhat cover up the things which are actually happening in the sense of CO2 taxes in the first place in a number of countries, plus activities by municipalities, London is an example. Take France, where I think in November something was decided which in December or in first of January was supplied in France. There were some adjustments made because the limits did not meet exactly the French car emissions. But this was corrected in time. But anyway, we saw, the total industry, saw the impact on the consumer behavior, which were significant. But now taking the January sales results, as the new basis to go forward would be a mistake, because we saw in December a significant pull forward sale and in January corresponding drops in the same segment. All together, we sold in France more products in January '08 than in January '07. But worse mix, and once again we had this uptake in their larger vehicles in December. So it's certainly too early to judge final consequence out of all of that.</p>
          <p>But it's very clear there are major distortions of markets created by pretty erratic or abrupt changes in the rules and procedures. Our confidence is based on our conviction that our technological and financial capability is second to none. And secondly, that we do not foresee a future, where politics will basically terminate larger cars, be it Benz or luxury cars or whatever. And on that assumption, we assume that we can always be as at least as good as our best competitors in the sense of complying with whatever regulations. But we are aware as well that ultimately we have to end up with vehicles which are CO emitants, CO2 emission free, and not dependant on oil either. So that is a clear direction we have to take. We are on the way towards that future. In between, we're making very fast progress in reducing the CO2 emissions of our vehicles significantly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in the next couple of quarters, I mean will you not see an impact on profitability as you work through the distortions of these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me perhaps, first of all on a global basis, given all the different situations at different markets we are confident to execute our plan for 2008 with the guidance we gave you. Secondly, I might use this opportunity just to remind you on something very normal in our seasonality throughout the year, we typically start with a somewhat lower first quarter and then improve over the second and third quarter with some decline in the fourth quarter. That's a typical pattern in our profits. So you should not take any given quarter multiply it by four and say that's where our running rates are in this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I have got a couple of questions. Firstly, regarding the potential one-offs that you expect here for 2008, so maybe you can give us more details regarding potential one-offs from the new management model in 2008? And then, maybe also regarding potential positive one-off resulting from your real estate sales that you have announced in the first quarter on the Potsdamer Platz building.</p>
          <p>Then other question is I had thought that you had lost here some market share in the North American region and gained some opposite market share in Western Europe. Is that a pattern that we should expect also for the coming quarters? Then the last question I have is on potential acquisitions we have discussed a lot of options regarding the use of cash, and I remember that Mr. Zetsche has made some statements in an interview in December saying that also acquisitions are maybe an option for growth. So maybe you can give us more details there, what could that mean here potentially for 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can talk about market share, you start with the one-offs, that's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the one-off, don't you think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question was you're right with Potsdamer Platz, that is also something what we disclosed. In the first quarter, you will see a one-time impact of course. We cannot sell the Potsdamer Platz twice, it would be nice. It's 0.4 billion in the first quarter. And other you mentioned then also the new management model effect which was last year roughly 250 million. We don't assume that this number will be higher than the impact of the Potsdamer Platz, so it would be lower than the impact on the Potsdamer Platz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if you were referring to pass cars by talking about market share developments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm talking about Trucks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. I thought you would know better because cars obviously we gained market share in the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to your statement with the United States, we lost a little bit in the Class 8 slightly I think 0.5%. We gained some market share in the medium segment in the NAFTA regions, overall, I think we are following our plans. In Europe, we were stable in the heavy-duty site, and we lost a little bit on the medium duty site. That was according to our plan, because we shifted from the medium duty side to the heavy-duty side also in Europe, the capacity. So, overall, I think that was basically in Europe. And in Latin America, we also gained some market share overall. Basically, the situation was despite NAFTA region, also some capacity restraints we had in last year, and that was the reason we made last year the decision to increase capacity. So that was a little bit of stretch also in the capacity side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I ask another question, it's on the market share in Western Europe. So is it fair to assume that you are able to build structurally more heavy trucks now in Western Europe that you adjusted the capacity slightly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps, I should add that we were somewhat constrained beyond our, constrained throughout the year in the last quarter, in the last month because of some supply issues we communicated at that point of time. One supplier issue.</p>
          <p>Okay, but you had a third part of your question or third question, which was regarding acquisitions. Yes, I made that comment. I would not, let me say the other way around. It's obvious that we have a strong balance sheet, and that we have high net liquidity. This alone is not a good reason for an acquisition. So we should not buy something because we have the money to do so. We often say it should come from the other end, look at potential targets which might fit to us, which are attractive in themselves. And where we would have a very strong confidence that we could add value to those companies by changing their ownership. And in this situation in this case then we have the money to do not everything we want, but almost everything we would potentially want to do. So just as any other company, it has to be part of our entrepreneurial activity and scope to consider potential external growth. But once again you should be confident that we are not planning for any crazy stuff or any stuff just to grow or to have nice headlines or something. Whatever we would do could only be justified by a strong conviction that we add value to the company, thereby to our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, is there any particular area you are looking at that moment? I mean the valuations in the Financial Services area came down significantly, so maybe this is an option.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We try to address this issue in a systematic and strategic and in general terms, and once again I do not want to prepare you for any major step or decision tomorrow morning. That is not the point at all. But just as the normal part of our business, we are strategically and systematically scanning most of all our own businesses and or business sectors. And thereby, plus upstream and downstream, looking for potential opportunities. And then we are looking somewhat right and left in comparable industries where for instance coming from our technological competence and strengths, we might see opportunities of adding value.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon, Frank Biller from LBBW. Just two quick questions, the one is in Q4 on the tax line. It seems to me that there has been a strong positive impact in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can elaborate a bit about this and how this can go on or if it just was a one-time effect? And the other thing in Van, Bus, and others. Well, it seems that Van and Buses are very profitable right now and that this is ongoing in 2008. But adding all up and coming to an adjusted EBIT figure, it was minus 20 million in the fourth quarter in my calculation. So there must have been big negative in the others, maybe you can say something about that and how it is going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, two good, &#x2013; very good questions. In the fourth quarter we had impacts from the tax reform in Germany. So there are some positives in the fourth quarter. Of course they will not occur let's say every quarter, that is one adjustment you have to do, that is to your first question. The second question, it's right. I'll walk you though to the VBO fourth quarter number. In that number, we have included the 377 million from impact from Chrysler at equity. We've including here the impact from EADS, which we said roughly 200 million from &#x2013; mainly from the A400M. And we have the 75 million from the sale of real estate in the fourth quarter. As you sum this stuff up, it is a positive of 550 million. If you adjust this, you come to a positive number of 50 million, not your 20 million sorry, but 50 million. So it's a remaining 150 million, which is related to de-merger costs after the transaction, so it's not part of the transaction and it was in the fourth quarter. This is for example, our separation in international sales, where some expenses occurred, and for example the close down of our shuttle to Detroit, where we had to make some provisions. And on top of that, we had some costs which were related to the Potsdamer Platz, all in all roughly 150 million, which you could add up to the 50 million. And then you come up with a sound profit to the Van and the Bus business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Punsit from Frankfurt. I have two questions, first one on your outlook statement. Could you please clarify, if it's based on the reported EBIT figure or an adjusted base? And also if the guidance for '08 includes these gains from the sale of Potsdamer Platz. This is the first one. And the second one, could you please give us the numbers for the positive effects from the lower depreciation coming from the efficiency improving programs? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question two is regarding the guidance, our guidance does not include any one timers for the year 2008. For the year 2007, it's included mainly the EADS impact, the impact from the, from Chrysler and the impact from the new management model, which is roughly 1 billion for 2007, which you can adjust from book numbers. Our, the extension of the useful life for the year 2008 were roughly 880 million for the fiscal year 2007 which is 600 million Mercedes-Benz Cars, roughly 130 million for Daimler Trucks, and roughly 150 million for the Van, Bus, Other segment.

          <p>Thanks a lot, it's me again, Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse, just a very quick one. Mr. Uebber I think if I am not wrong, you have been investigating whether you can get rid of Chrysler in your &#x2013; at equity accounting. You mentioned that that's not possible. Is that a final assessment, firstly? And secondly on lithium-ion batteries, is that a business in future that a car maker has to control? Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think there is no alternative right now to change this Daimler equity, Chrysler equity accounting. That is from today's point of view. It's also the auditors point of view that we have to apply the equity accounting. And there is, if there would be a change, of course we would inform you. And of course, you have to keep in mind that everything which impacts here is non-cash.</p>

          <p>Of course I understand it's not easy for you and also not easy for me to come up with that stuff, because we get that on a one quarter change. I know this, therefore we will disclose always the impact when we get it, and of course then you can make up your mind. You can adjust it then with our disclosure, but for the time being that's the case. And I cannot change it as long as the auditors do say that we have to apply equity accounting here.</p>

          <p>Lithium-ion batteries, on the one-hand, you have the cells which are producing and doing research and development in cells is relatively far away from an automotive competent set. So I don't think a carmaker in general should be or we should be involved in that business. Making batteries out of cells which is a question of packaging cooling. And most of all then the ECU, the electric control of the battery, is something which is very close to our knowledge. We have a number of patents at Mercedes in this regard. This is very essential you know about the laptops, which where risk on going on fire with millions of units. So the cooling is a very essential issue for instance. This is something we are looking into and where we might do something ourselves based on cells being purchased to come up with final batteries. I wouldn't say it's mandatory for a car manufacturer. But if you have component as we do, it might give you a competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Sorry to come back on the guidance, but I will make it &#x2013; I will try to make it easier. Will the EBIT in 2008 be significantly higher than 8.7 billion or will it be a significantly higher than 7.7 billion, just to clarify?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an easy one. The 7.7 million is the adjusted number for 2007 and this is the comparable number.</p>
