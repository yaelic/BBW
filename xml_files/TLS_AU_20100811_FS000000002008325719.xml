          <p>Good morning, everyone. My name is Ben Spincer, Director of Investor Relations at Telstra. I'd like to welcome you to this our 2010 financial results presentation. I should also welcome all those people on the phone and also watching the webcast this morning. I will hand over now to the CEO David Thodey who will give a brief introduction and then we will run though the results with David and John. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ben and let me also just add my welcome, great to have you here and also welcome everyone who is on the phone right around the world I do say.</p>
          <p>Well let me begin, 2010 definitely was a tough year and we've faced many significant challenges, the NBN negotiations were long and protracted. We've seen quite a significant change in consumer behavior which we've sort of seen happening for a while but now has accelerated and of course we're seeing much tougher price competition. But despite those challenges the company has emerged stronger. We've seen renewed momentum in the last couple of months of the last half. We're seeing improvement, improving customer service and of course we have the preliminary agreement well on NBN.</p>
          <p>Now in addition and we'll be talking about this in a moment, we've achieved our February operating guidance including the key target of $6 billion of free cash flow and we've seen really strong cost management right throughout the year. But of course these challenges haven't gone away and the whole industry faces many challenges that we're going to have to confront. Now as Ben said we're going to change the format a little bit this year. I'm going to ask John to come up and actually go through all the financial results then I'm going to come back later on and actually talk about the future. Think this might be a better structure for the morning.</p>
          <p>But before we begin I do want to address a very important strategic decision that we need to make for this company. Today the greatest asset that Telstra has is our customer base and we have been losing too many customers. And we cannot allow it. In fact I'm not going to allow to continue. So we've got two strategic options we've got in front of us. Firstly, we could maximize our cash returns in the short term, cut costs and continue to lose market share or we could take a longer term view by investing and that's investing in customer service, simplifying the business and competing aggressively to retain and acquire customers. And of course to prepare for future opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now we have looked at this in detail and we believe that it is in the best interest of shareholders to manage this business for the sustainable future growth of this company, not for the short term. So today we are going to announce some bold but necessary steps to drive profitable growth over the longer term. But I'm going to come back and talk about that later on. Let me now pass across to John who is going to take you through the results for last year. So John.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone here and everyone wherever you may be. Let me start by saying that in November 2005 we set a target of achieving $6 billion free cash flow and by 2010. This was obviously an extremely important target for us and our shareholders. How we achieve this target has evolved with the business and market over the last 5 years. But I am pleased to say that 5 years down the track we are there.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to the rest of the results, because that certainly is a highlight. As David mentioned, I am pleased to report this morning that we met our February guidance for the fiscal year 2010. And as I just said, we grew free cash flow by $1.9 billion to $6.2 billion this year. We maintained our $0.28 per share dividend for the full year and that's fully franked. All this despite the challenging market conditions we faced over the past year.</p>
          <p>On our February guidance basis, so excluding the CSL impairment, we reported a sales revenue decline of 2.2% to $24.8 billion. Operating expenses continue to be tightly managed and fell by 4.5%. With this tight cost control EBITDA grew by 0.6% with margins growing 1.2 percentage points to 44.4%. EBIT grew by 1.7%, in line with our guidance of low single digit growth. Including the impairment of CSL, EBITDA declined by 0.9% and EBIT also declined by 0.9% and profit after-tax declined by 4.7%.</p>
          <p>As always there are some adjustments that need to be made to our reported financial results to get a better representation of the underlying business performance. These adjustments are consistent with the adjustments we made at the half year so they take into account the sale of KAZ in the prior year the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar through the year, the fair value adjustments included in the finance cost plus of course the CSL impairment.</p>
          <p>For the rest of this presentation therefore I'll be discussing the adjusted numbers. On an adjusted basis therefore the sales revenue declined by 0.2%, EBITDA grew by 1.3% and EBIT was up 2.4% and profit after tax up 7.6%. You can also see the improved performance in the second half, which was a key commitment we made at the half year with sales revenue growing 0.3%, EBITDA 2.4% and EBIT up 2.7%.</p>
          <p>While I'm talking about high level numbers I'd just like to cover off the impairment charge at CSL. Telstra's investment in CSL is recorded in our financial statements in Australian dollars and a test of the investments carrying value is undertaken each half year using the A dollar forecast cash flows for the business. The forecast cash flows of CSL had been lowered to reflect the softer margins the business is likely to experience given the intensely competitive wireless market in Hong Kong and the lower '09, '10 base given the recent performance of the business. As such we booked a non-cash impairment against the goodwill of this investment of $168 million.</p>
          <p>But looking forward we remain upbeat about the fiscal year '11 performance of CSL and we expect top line in the local currency to return to growth as the Hong Kong economy improves. And CSL takes advantage of the opportunity presented by the iPhone 4 and leveraging its network advantage. This will be the first time CSL has sold the iPhone and should assist the business to recapture the revenue market share.</p>
          <p>In terms of performance from our products, it has been a challenging year. The PSTN revenue loss was significant however we are still seeing strong growth in the key areas of mobiles and IP products. For this fiscal year PSTN revenue declined 8% to $5.8 billion and fixed Internet declined by 0.7% to $2.1 billion. Mobiles was again strong, with total mobile revenue increasing 6.4%, an increase of $439 million. IP and data access was up 1.7% to $1.8 billion, however within this category IP access grew 24% to $835 million, leveraging off our wireline transformation. Of course the changing product mix means that margins also changed.</p>
          <p>So before I discuss the product performance in more detail, I'd like to look at the profitability of those products. PSTN is clearly impacting our profitability, given the decline in revenue from that product. What is encouraging is that fixed broadband margins have improved as the broadband market has slowed and we achieve lower network unit cost from the economy of scales. Mobiles, IP and data, fixed broadband and Sensis have driven the greatest value in absolute EBITDA terms. However, the contribution from those products is being offset by the dilution in PSTN where the revenue decline is faster than the decline in costs.</p>
          <p>These pie charts provide a summary of how Telstra's revenue and EBITDA mix has changed over the past year as well as highlighting just how diversified our portfolio of products is. Of particular note is a continued relative shift in the importance of mobiles and PSTN. PSTN's contribution to EBITDA has declined by 3 percentage points in the year, symptomatic of the structured decline in that product, while mobiles has increased by 2 percentage points. It is also worth noting the importance of Sensis to the business. It contributed 9% of revenue and 11% of total EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Back to the performance of our products. Fixed retail broadband revenue grew by 0.9% to $1.5 billion however what is more pleasing is that our new pricing plans and bundles has seen the negative SIO trend experienced over the past 2 halves reverse in the second half of this fiscal year. 11,000 customers were added and we only saw a very minor reduction in ARPU in the 6 months to 30 June. In terms of IP access, the growth in IP access revenue of 23.5% offsets the decline in legacy specialized data and global products such as loose lines. Furthermore, as the penetration of IP applications grow, customer value also increases.</p>
          <p>Sensis also achieved a solid improvement during the second half. This was achieved as Sensis continued to use next generation digital media products such as the T-Hub and iPhone to complement the more standard directories channels of print and online. In terms of financial performance, Sensis' domestic sales revenue declined by 2.3% in the second half, an improvement on the 3.6 decline in the first half.</p>
          <p>In terms of mobiles, total mobile revenue grew by 6.4% to $7.3 billion, with service revenue increasing 5.9% to $6.5 billion. Again, second half momentum has improved with mobile service revenue growing by 7.1% compared to the 4.7% growth in the first half.</p>
          <p>Where this growth is coming from is data. Data really is the mobile growth story. Telstra now has over 1.6 million wireless broadband customers and revenue generated in this area are increased by 34% to $787 million for the full year. The largest component of data revenue is still messaging, which grew by 14%. You can also see here how we have provided additional reporting of prepaid unique users. We believe unique users is a more representative and less volatile measure of our revenue generating prepaid customers.</p>
          <p>Moving on to PSTN. On this chart we have attempted to deconstruct the $0.5 billion absolute decline in PSTN revenues in the past year and look at the drivers of that decline. I'd urge you to treat some of these numbers as indicative because we have made some assumptions around average users and the retail/wholesale split to get this on a single page, but there are some obvious conclusions. The PSTN decline is driven by a combination of line loss and usage decline. In terms of the line loss, about a third of the revenue has shifted to ULL with the rest loss to more than 200,000 net cancelations in the year. On usage there has been a decline in all core categories in the last year. Overall PSTN customers made nearly six fewer calls a month in 2010 than they made during 2009, with the decline in fixed mobile being the biggest driver. But we probably clawed back around a third of the ULL revenue decline in our wholesale division and ULL booked in our intercarrier access revenue line, we are also seeing &#x2013; and that's where it appears in our financial statements that you have.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing strong growth in our IP telephony products with some revenue shifting from PSTN to IP access. Finally, there is clearly significant mobile substitution occurring both in terms of the traffic moving to mobile and also an increase in mobile only households, which we now estimate is around about 12%. So if we look at this in terms of PSTN and PSTN substitution, there is still a decline but it's perhaps overall when you take all those movements into account, around 5 to 6%.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to expenses I just want to discuss the performance of our retail business units. Telstra Consumer faced a very challenging year through the intensely competitive landscape. Sales revenue declined by 0.5%, however, significant initiatives such as the T-Hub, new bundles in pricing were implemented in the second half to address this performance. Around 41% of our consumer customers have 2 or more Telstra products and around 300,000 customers have signed up for our new bundled offer. Business returned to growth in the second half with sales revenue growing 2.3% after declining by 0.4% in the first half. In the second half Telstra business launched Mobile Plus pricing plans which incorporated both voice and data and as a result we have seen increased smartphone penetration and higher data ARPUs.</p>
          <p>In the Enterprise and Government segment, revenue growth accelerated in the second half to 2.9%, with 0.3% growth in the first half. For the full year on an underlying basis, so excluding the sale of KAZ, sales revenue grew by 1.6% and significant contract wins during the year including Suncorp and Komatsu contributed to that outcome.</p>
          <p>Now let me move on to expenses and a real, which is a real positive to come out of those results. Excluding the CSL impairment, operating expenses declined by $653 million or 4.5% this fiscal year. Variable costs as a percentage of sales has increased this year, but this is an important trend as this does reflect the product mix shift that I spoke about earlier and later you'll hear more about how that's continuing.</p>
          <p>However, we continue to maintain a very tight control over our fixed costs which declined by 7.5% this year and that does exclude the CSL impairment. So looking more closely at where the cost savings were realized this year. Labor expense, adjusted for cash and FX movements, declined by 6.2%. The decline has been driven by fewer head count plus a lower salary and associated cost expense. Redundancy costs also declined due to the absence of, or lower redundancies than we had the prior year, redundancies associated with our marketing simplification program. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs or SARCs have increased. That is flagged at the half. This has been managed, been a managed increase to support the popularity of smartphones. While SARCs has increased, SARCs as percentage of mobile services revenue has increased by less than 1%.</p>
          <p>One area of disappoint to us is in our cost base has been our bad debt expense. Bad debts did increase 44% to 364 million. Admittedly much of the increase was self inflicted with what we call bad volumes. Bad volumes includes sort of misalignment between the customer's choice of a plan and the plan they are initially billed for and the difficult economic times also contributed to the larger write off. So we had two elements, we had confusion by customers with plans and charges on their bills, et cetera. But we also did experience some bad debts due to the economic conditions. And pleasing though we know we've got a detailed remediation plan in place to make sure they are lower, we have lower bad debts moving forward. On a more positive note, there were large decreases in many categories of our discretionary costs including travel and our legal expenses.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a quick look at depreciation and finance and tax. D&amp;A came down &#x2013; came in at $4.3 billion and adjusting for KAZ and the impacts of FX again D&amp;A did decline by 0.3%. While the depreciation charge was lower due to the absence of the prior year's accelerated depreciation in CSL, amortization expense increased due to a full year of amortization of the Trading Post masthead, which we signaled we would do last time and that was about $67 million.</p>
          <p>Borrowing costs also reduced this year by 11.7% or to just over $1 billion as the average volume of debt and the cost of servicing that debt is lower. Over the past 12 months net debt has reduced to $13.9 billion while our average borrowing costs on average debt was 6.4%.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the tax and the all important franking credit balance, at the full year our franking account balance was in deficit to the tune of $138 million. However it is important to note that the tax payments we have made subsequent to 30 June will allows us to have sufficient franking credits to enable us to fully frank the final dividend of $0.14 per share. Looking forward, we expect the franking credit balance to remain tight for a number of years, while we do not believe this will constrain our ability to fully frank a dividend at current levels. It will constrain our ability to increase fully franked dividends should the board resolve to increase returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Moving on to capital expenditure, operating capital expenditure declined by $1.1 billion to $3.5 billion. This represents 14% of sales so right in line our guidance. What is on the slide here is how we look at CapEx internally. So on an activity view rather than a technology view which is how we have disclosed CapEx in the past. But you'll find in both views in the documents that we've lodged and handed out today. As you can see, the largest component of our CapEx been this year was customer demand and customer experience. It accounted for 45% of our total CapEx program. Customer demand and experience CapEx, which did reduce by 404 million to 1.6 billion is focused on meeting our customer demand for existing products and services such as mobile base stations and spending on our fixed access networks. Whilst on fixed access CapEx, while I'm talking about that expenditure we would not have to bear with a fully rolled out NBN, would be around $300 million per annum.</p>
          <p>Moving on to free cash flow, as I said earlier, we exceeded our target, generating $6.2 billion of free cash flow this fiscal year. The increase in free cash flow of the year came from obviously the reduced capital expenditure we had of $1.3 billion but also a one-off R&amp;D tax refund of almost $250 million. As you can see from the slide, free cash flow has more than doubled over the last 3 years which has given us the headroom to make some investments to ensure future growth.</p>
          <p>So before moving on to the last slide which is about guidance, I want to explain why we need to make an investment in the business in 2011 which results in the guidance that we are giving today. The pressures on the business are quite different from 5 years ago. While margins increased in fiscal 2010, it is because we delivered on our fixed cost reductions from the transformation as I went through earlier. In 2005, the transformation was an enabler for ongoing product and service differentiation and improvements in operations. 5 years on, the industry is at an inflexion point and Telstra in particular. With price competition being intense, fixed services being substituted by mobile services and product mix changes putting pressure on margins, we must prepare for this by structurally changing the company which will require some investment, mainly indirectly variable costs and an investment to deliver a lower cost operation and revenue growth in the longer term. David will tell you in his presentation what we are doing and how we are going about it.</p>
          <p>So leads me to the guidance. We view 2011 as a transition year as we invest in operational excellence to prepare the company to compete in the future. We had made this decision to improve customer service and satisfaction, simplify our business and core processes and prepare the business for an NBN world by investing to grow new revenue streams that compensate for reductions in traditional fixed revenues.</p>
          <p>So 2011, we expect an increase in the customer base with flattish revenue. But because of our investments and the changing product mix, the company expects high single digit percentage decline in EBITDA. We also expect free cash flow of somewhere between 4.5 and $5 billion. I do want to point out that the half year, the first half of the year will have some variation to it because we are expecting one of our Yellow Pages books, in fact the Melbourne Book which is around about $100 million to be in the second half of this fiscal year, not the first half as it was last year. So I just want to alert you to that because as you try and figure out the half results or the expectations you need to know that.</p>
          <p>Bottom line here really is we must invest to grow, win customers and lower our cost base to make room for a lower margin product mix world and to grow our EBITDA going forward. The benefits of this necessary investment will become obvious from 2012. Excluding any possible spectrum acquisition costs we foresee CapEx to sales of 14% over the medium term. It is important to note that the fiscal year '11 guidance is off our reported numbers, so the sales revenue of 24.8 billion and the EBITDA of 10.8 billion. Our guidance also assumes wholesale product price stability, over which we don't have a lot of control; no additional impairments to investment; and excludes any proceeds from sale of businesses. And you are aware we are in the middle of looking at the sale of Super fund for example.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to thank you for listening to that and I'd now like to hand back to David, who will go through our future directions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John. I think it was a very good summary. Okay, as I said at the beginning, the industry and Telstra are really going through some significant changes. But what I want to try and focus on now is it creates this unique opportunity for Telstra to really invest for the future and I want to try and give you some color about that this morning.</p>
          <p>What we've got to do is put customers right at the center of what this company does every day. Very importantly John mentioned simplifying this business, taking all the complexity out of it so we truly can get a lower cost base going forward. We need to continue to focus on retaining and acquiring new customers, growing our customer base is very important and of course where to find new revenue streams as we go forward. You see this company has got to transform. It's got to move from being an engineering and technology led company to being a truly sales and market lead company. We need to keep our technology leadership but we must become truly sales and marketing led.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to touch on about 4 areas this morning. Firstly, just touch again on some of the key achievements in 2010. So a little bit more about the inflection point we see in the industry, what's happening and why we're responding the way we are. A little bit about how we're going to respond and then talk a little bit more about the guidance. Now I'm only going to have a few moments to touch on each area. We do have an Investor Day scheduled for late September where we'll go in with more detail. A number of the senior execs will be able to talk about at that time exactly about some of the detailed initiatives under each of these initiatives.</p>
          <p>Okay, let me start by just mentioning some of the significant achievements that really are quite remarkable really when you look at what the Telstra team has performed over the last 6 months. When I gave the half year results, I said how disappointed I was that we weren't able to bring a number of initiatives to market quickly enough. Well the second half was different. We really lifted the pace and we brought a large number of offers to market and we're seeing some of the early signs of momentum resulting from those initiatives.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis we returned to modest growth in the second half and that was really driven by the mobile performance and of course IP performance which offset this enormous deterioration in PSTN. Now our sales results are improving and interest in our products, new products are high. So let's just go through a few of the strong results. I mean obviously Sensis, strong EBITDA growth. We soldmore than 300,000 bundles, 300,000 new wireless broadband customers. Mobile services revenue growth increased from 4.7% in the first half to 7.1% in the second half. And we're delighted that the new T-Hub and T-Box are experiencing strong interest and we've already sold 60,000 units ahead of our plan and that was as of last weekend. And of course we saw great sales results from the introduction of the iPhone 4 and we have also put new Pre-Paid cap plans into the market just last week.</p>
          <p>So these results are encouraging. And top of this, the steps we began taking 15 months ago to improve customer satisfaction are starting to bite in the market. When I began as CEO, I described myself as an agent of the customer and I said it would not be quick or simple to reorient this company around our customers. However, I am pleased to report that throughout the year we began implementing a wide range of initiatives that are really starting to make a difference. Some of these included a new case management process for when people move home, a critical time when they make a decision on their telecommunication needs. We've introduced weekend appointments for our technicians. We've also put in new internal standards around responsiveness to queries, sales queries and complaints, which is starting to make this company more responsive. And of course as I mentioned we've put in new bundles and new pricing plans across a large name &#x2013; range of products over the last 6 months.</p>
          <p>So these changes are starting to make a difference. We're seeing TIO complaints come down by one third, though they're still too high. We have a very active program to manage all complaints and I am pleased to say in the monthly customer satisfaction survey we run, which is the customers giving us feedback about how we're going, we've seen an increase of 5% in the last 12 months which is very encouraging. Now, while we know there is still a lot more to do, we're started this journey and we're heading in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Now another significant achievement was the NBN Financial Heads of Agreement that we signed last year. Now, I do want to stress, as you would expect we are nonpartisan when it comes to politics and we will constructively work with either side of government. So, we're making no comment about the policies of each party or the outcome of the federal election today. However, the non-binding Financial Heads of Agreement was a very important milestone. It's, you know it really was a tremendous amount of work that the team did to get to that point and it delivers a post-tax net present value of approximately $11 billion which includes around $9 billion consideration from NBN for copper decommissioning and infrastructure leasing and of course the $2 billion from the government in the form of other initiatives and avoided costs.</p>
          <p>It's very important to understand, which was said before, the board will only take a proposal to shareholders that they believe will be in the best interest of our shareholders. I do want to clarify a few elements of this $9 billion. Between 40 and 50% of it will be for leasing our duct, exchange space, dark fiber and managed backhaul. The arrangement will be for 30 years or possibly more, so it provides for long-term certainty and we anticipate that the final decommissioning of copper will occur within 18 months of fiber being rolled out in any area. So, we are currently working on all the details, financial, legal and regulatory as we move forward towards definitive agreements.</p>
          <p>For instance, we've agreed to supply and install optic fiber network infrastructure in Brunswick in Victoria which was a first release site for NBN Co. I do want to stress, there is still a lot of work ahead of us to get the agreement finalized and that we still need to get legislation passed, the ACCC approval must be also be obtained. But once these things have been achieved we'll be submitting this to our shareholders for a vote and which we expect to do in the first half of next calendar year.</p>
          <p>So, we're pleased with the progress on the NBN negotiations. But as a last point around NBN. Whatever happens with NBN is irrelevant to what we need to do as a company. There are fundamental changes occurring in this industry that make it essential for Telstra to undergo significant change. So what I'd like to talk about now is a little bit about some of this change we're seeing in the market, what we call the inflection point, and give you some color to some of the comments John's already made.</p>
          <p>We mentioned the accelerating decline in PSTN revenues. We've seen this reduction in fixed calls due to mobile substitution and of course that's being driven by capped plans primarily. We've seen a significant change in our product mix. We've seen the growth in mobile internet growing faster than fixed internet. Also we've seen this explosive use of data and video with little incremental revenue, and of course increasing price competition right across all the product categories but especially fixed broadband. And then lastly we're seeing growing infrastructure base competition partly due to government subsidized backhaul.</p>
          <p>All of these forces are shifting our revenue mix towards lower margin products, so we need to take action. So we have the strategic choice, do we maximize short term cash returns by reducing costs and losing market share or do we bite the bullet and invest for longer term growth. Now we've decided that we must invest to maintain and acquire customers and to grow the business. We cannot continue to lose market share.</p>
          <p>So we're going to take some bold steps. All of our actions will be consistent with the strategy that we outlined last October to satisfy our customers, invest in innovation and differentiation and of course find and realize new growth opportunities. So this next year, 2011, will be a transition year and we are going to focus on 4 key initiatives. Firstly, it's all going to be around customer satisfaction, serving our customers. We are going to simplify our business to reduce costs and of course to improve the customer experience. Also we are going to compete fairly but very aggressively to retain and acquire customers, leveraging our significant investments in network leadership that began 5 years ago. And of course invest in the long term business opportunities that we see.</p>
          <p>So let me talk about just a little bit briefly now to give you some color on some of the things we are going to be investing in. Firstly customer satisfaction. We are going to continue to invest to improve customer service and satisfaction to our customers. This must become a key differentiator for Telstra. Over the next year we are going to do a number of things and I'm just going to mention a few quickly.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we're going to introduce 24 by 7 contact center support. This is a new initiative that will commence on 14 September making Telstra the first full service telco to offer such a service. We are going to build an improved online capability, so customers can deal with Telstra online more often. We are also going to remove process bottlenecks that lead to complaints, so we improve our responsiveness to customer inquiries, issues and sales opportunities. We will also increase the customer satisfaction component in managers' performance bonuses so that we get the whole company focused on that. Now, customer service is now a fundamental and unifying theme for every part of Telstra, every part of Telstra, and it will be the cornerstone of our strategy going forward.</p>
          <p>Secondly and very importantly we are going to simplify this business. We're going to drive savings that will improve customer service and satisfaction. We've begun on a 3-year journey to simplify our business and to deliver a lower sustainable cost base. Now, this is rather than an indiscriminate short term cost cutting program and this was considered that we must drive simplification into this business. As well as improving customer service, we will also improve productivity, change our channel mix and create a lower cost operating model.</p>
          <p>This program is going to touch every part of this business and we've already started with the appointment of Robert Nason and we have teams working right across the business now. For example, you would have seen that we've reduced the Telstra executive ranks by more than 300 people. This will simplify our business, improve accountability, reduce management layers and make life simpler and faster for frontline staff to serve customers. You also would have seen another initiative, we brought together Telstra Country Wide and Telstra Consumer to make a more streamlined organization. Simplifying our business will be a huge project and we'll redefine all the key processes in the company and we will have much more to say about this at the Investor Day.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, as I said in February, we must do what is necessary to stem market share decline and grow our customer base. This means competing more effectively and leveraging the incredible strengths we have in the Next G and Next IP networks. We need to acquire and retain customers which will lead to growth in our customer base and overall revenue. Now, we're going to do this in a number of different ways. We must invest in sales and marketing capability in 2011. We need to continue innovative and segmented based pricing. And of course you've seen over the last 6 months that we revised our prices on fixed and in mobile and broadband and postpaid and Pre-Paid. This will continue and we will do what is necessary to acquire and retain the best customers. This will require a significant investment in sales and marketing this year.</p>
          <p>So, this is going to be a transition year, this is about competing and we are going to sell and market our differentiated products and services more aggressively. It is about leveraging the billions of dollars that we've invested for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a couple of examples. Our investment in Next G has delivered $787 million in wireless broadband over just 4 years. Wireless broadband penetration is approximately 17% and our customer base is now 1.65 million people, up 58% only a year ago. Smartphones also represent a huge opportunity for us. For example over the past year, the number of smartphone subscribers grew by 30% to 1.6 million and usage and ARPU grew as well. Thanks to our Next G network, Telstra is well positioned to take advantage of the accelerating migration to wireless communications.</p>
          <p>In the next 12 months we will continue to drive our leadership in wireless speed and coverage. This will include introducing 42 megabits per second network download speeds peak, which will be a world first, and we are already trialing LTE. We believe that mobile can continue to grow at mid single digit levels for the next few years. That means in just 2 more years the mobile business may generate around $8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me give you another example, our Next IP network, which we will continue to invest in for market leadership. Our Next IP network has enabled us to double our IP access revenues in just 3 years. And as one of John's slide showed, the IP ARPU escalator, highlighting that about two thirds of our IP customers now buy managed WAN product from us and about 12% use IP telephony. Next IP also give us a large growth opportunity in markets adjacent to our traditional carriage business. One such market is network-absent services, which we are going to invest in as we go forward and we are very excited about cloud computing, both in terms of infrastructure-as-a-service, but also software-as-a-service, and this applies both to the business market and to the enterprise and government market. So we're moving up the value stair.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk to the fourth initiative. We must make some significant investments to ensure our long term growth. A good example is how the digital future will impact a number of our key market segments. And we need to make the right investments. Let me just briefly mention a few of them. Firstly, the digital home which will offer consumers a way of integrating entertainment, information and communication services with their broadband connection. The very successful new T-Box and T-Hub IPTV are positive steps towards the digital home. Media, content and advertising also present exciting opportunities for us in the future.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the digital business will integrate all data, video, voice and computing requirements for our small business customers, boosting productivity and improving services. Prices are going to be simple, easy to understand and services will be charged on a per-seat basis. We're very excited about this offering.</p>
          <p>In the enterprise market, we are going to continue to build on our strategic offers, offers around application services all at a lower cost to improve productivity for those large customers. Then in the digital media space, Sensis is already undergoing significant investment in an exciting new set of online products for our Yellow Pages customers, which we think will really take us to a new level. Now you are going to hear more about this at Investor Day including the digital media opportunities at Sensis and we'll take you through them then.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to guidance and the investments necessary to achieve our strategic objectives. As John and I have already discussed, these investments will increase our cost base in 2011 because we are investing to grow our customer base. This will be a transition year, but these investments will be selective. They will be carefully targeted and they are going to be rigorously monitored to ensure they serve the long-term interests of customers and shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me you remind you once more why these investments are so essential at this time. The challenges we face are real. Either we ignore those challenges and as I said maximize cash in the short term and continue to lose market share or we make this investment now to allow us to return to revenue and profit growth in the future. So in terms of guidance as John went through, we expect an increase in the customer base with flattish revenues in 2011. Our investments will lead to a high single digit percentage decline in EBITDA, free cash flow of between 4.5 and $5 billion and from 2012 the benefits of our investments will become obvious.</p>
          <p>Let me now conclude. There is no question that Telstra faces a unique set of challenges. But as I introduced this session, it's also a tremendous opportunity to do something that is required for this business. We've got to take some bold and concerted action now to ensure that Telstra continues to grow profitably and lead in the market. We must focus on retaining and acquiring customers because this is our greatest asset. At the heart of this strategy is a commitment to improve customer service and satisfaction. We must simplify this business. We must compete more effectively both in the market and as we build out new products for future growth. We have a lot of work to do, but we are confident we've got the right team. We're confident that we're going to deliver real sustainable value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much. Now I am sure you have got a number of questions. John, I'll come up here and we'll be happy to take your questions now. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dave and John. As ever, we will be taking questions right from here in Sydney and also from the phones. There might be 14 or 15 of you trying to ask questions today. So, can I request you, you limit yourself which refers to just a couple of questions and maybe come back later. We will take the first 3 questions from here in Sydney then we'll go to the phone lines. Richard?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Eary from UBS. Just the first question, in terms of the guidance that you've given of high single EBIT declines. I mean, if you look at between a 5 to 10% range for example, it's $1.1 billion to $550 million increase in your cost base. Can you sort of outline how much of that is attributable to mix in terms of revenues from a margin as you pointed out, and if you can give us a bit more detail in terms of what the remaining portion will be spent on? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>The second question is that, if you look at that new guidance, just back of the envelope suggests maybe an EPS range of 0.25 to $0.28 for the '11 year which obviously puts a question about the ability to pay the $0.28 of dividend for '11. I just, John you made a comment about the ability to pay so I'm just wondering whether you can add to that comment first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I take the first one. John do you want to take the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look the increase in operating expense is very targeted at acquiring customers. And we're going to be taking a lot of the fixed, what we call the fixed cost out of the business and that's what Project Simplify is and Robert and the team are working on that. That's very important to allow us to compete more aggressively in the market. But we must do that to both maintain our customers and to grow share. And as you know that pulls through a lot of DVCs and especially in the mobiles, you got the product mix as well. So, a large proportion of that will be in terms of growing and competing in the market. So that's where that's going. But we've also got to invest to get this simplification into the business, because you can't just throw money at it. You've got to rework things, drive significant change in all our processes. So that's really where that increase is going. So, John do you want to handle the EPS side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David, can I ask a follow-up before John answers? You talked about Project Simplify. I mean, could you elaborate in terms of what costs you expect to save from Project Simplify, and what happens to any of the transformation costs that were supposed to flow into '11? Because clearly if you add those cost savings on, then the gross spend is obviously higher than the reported number in terms of the decline in the OpEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the transformational work has delivered some significant savings as John went through. But this is a different time to what we had 5 years ago, this is about as a product mix change, you've got your whole structure of the business changes. So we've got to invest more in DVCs as we go forward. In terms of Project Simplify, that's a 3-year program, we are very clear about what savings we're going to get. We've gone through, in fact there's 27-odd projects that we're working through now and we will be able to take you through more of that at Investor Day. John do you want to go to EPS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Simply to say, Richard, that there is sufficient cash in that number to pay a dividend at the current level and yes it's a lot prior than has proven this year that's just gone by. But we wouldn't have to borrow to pay dividend on those free cash outcomes at the current level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the franking and the $0.28 is safe for FY '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the board so decides to have that level of dividend, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe a follow-up question. You talked about obviously reinvesting for growth in the future. I know you probably don't want to be dragged in terms towards the outlook statements beyond FY '11. But what sort of payback are you looking at? Is this a 24 month, 36 month payback or are we expecting a big reflection in '12 or '13 or was it going to be a much more delayed depending on what happens on obviously regulation and NBN.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well why don't I take a go at that one then we probably need to move to the next question. Look, we've got very specific product development plans. They all have to meet the normal criteria we set in terms of returns. But you're right, in an NBN world, even without NBN as it goes to an IP based world, we've got to build a large new range of products to allow us to compete aggressively in the market. They will all be rigorously tested against our normal investment criteria. But for example we talked about, what we are doing in Sensis in digital media, very important program in terms of moving online. Talked about digital business with Deena, she is doing a tremendous amount of work with building a new product portfolio. All must make the normal investment criteria. But it is a new world, so you know as you move from PSTN to an IP based world. So that's the criteria we're using.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sameer Chopra from Merrill Lynch. I had one question just on clarification and then two follow-ups. In terms of your guidance, is that off reported numbers, the EBITDA for '10 which was 10.85, just want to make sure is the guidance that you're giving for next year off reported numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is just on the NBN deal itself. Do you get paid regardless of whether a line is active or not? So in Australia now we have 10% of homes are wireless. The NBN implementation study they think it can rise to 20. Do you still get paid the one-off compensation regardless of whether there is a active line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's a very good question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My third question is, you now have 300,000 customers on the new bundled plans and I was wondering if you can talk about what you are seeing in terms of absolute revenue for those 300,000 customers? You are probably retaining customers, prices are coming down. Just wanted to sort of understand what does it mean for absolute revenues for those customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well of course that's a good question Sameer because we look at that whether the ARPU goes up, down or sideways. We are very pleased with the early results in terms of bundles we're seeing. ARPU is still staying pretty much flat and we are also seeing an uptake of extra product as well. So early signs are very encouraging. And we're just trying to monitor that because the first trend, 1,000, were the early adaptors and what the next slot will be like. But so far we're very encouraging and of course you get the longer term contract as you alluded to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Blair at Southern Cross Equities. Two questions from me. Firstly on operating performance by business unit. If you look at the consumer business, it's still at the top line, still tracking backwards in the second half whereas I think Telstra business and E&amp;G had turned that corner. Can you just give us a sense for what's happening there? Obviously leads into some of the plans in FY '11. But, and also what you're seeing perhaps through July as you brought some of the new price plans out. That's the first question and then the second question which is a bit of a follow up to Richard's. If '11 is a transition year, can you give us a bit of a sense beyond that in terms of revenue growth, margins, perhaps free cash, what's the prize that we should expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Well let me answer the consumer one. Where is Gordon Ballantyne? Just behind you, the new head of, can you stand up for a moment, Gordon? So we now have a new Head of Consumer, so Gordon has just arrived, so that's great. The team are all coming together. Look yes, consumer is the challenged segment of the 3 at the moment. We continue to see revenue decline, however as you mentioned the June and July, we are seeing some early improvement in the physicals. But it is a challenging market with such strong price movement. We've seen enormous price movement of fixed broadband, mobiles, Pre-Paid, and we need to continue to be competitive.</p>
          <p>Now we've got a strategy around bundles, T-Box, T-Hub. So good products and they've got some early momentum going through. It's going to be a tough year, my view, because PSTN is still declining so quickly and that calling rates coming off, 6 calls per month, it's significant. We've got aggressive mobile plans in the market that of course offsets but also encourages people to move from fixed to mobile. So we are encouraged by our competitiveness but we just think it's going to be a tough year and we've sort of hit this inflection point around PSTN revenues. So we've got a product mix change, we've got to invest, we've got to compete and that's what Gordon's here to do. So that's that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As just a bit of follow up to that, David, June, July improving. Does that mean versus PCPs, you've seen revenue growth as?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we're talking about physicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just physicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just physicals, just physicals at the moment and of course because we had such big price movements, we're still waiting to see just how the revenues flow through. But they're very conservative on that. The second one was on our forecast, you want to do a forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle forecast. Look, we're making these investments and now look, we know that it's a bit of surprise but we have really gone through this. We must hold our customer base and increase it. Now we are doing this for future growth, for future growth. The market's very volatile, but we're saying it's future growth but we are not giving you any specific numbers at this time. But it is very much a growth strategy. Yes, okay, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it &#x2013; we &#x2013; it's a volatile market. We've got NBN coming so there is a fair bit of uncertainty. And so we're deliberately not giving any guidance beyond 2011 for that reason. And, but this is a reset of the business and obviously, you can work out from the numbers and Richard's done the 500 million to $1 billion sum. It's resetting our EBITDA margins as the product mix changes and we do expect, as we said, improvement from 2012. The simplification and how we service the customer will save us costs and as I said in my presentation, we have to make room for this different product mix and that's what this transition year is all about. And so we do expect as I said improvement from 2012 and 2013 but we're just not quantifying it at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your time this morning. Just have 3 questions for you. Firstly I mean, congratulations I'd say for biting the bullet. I think it certainly is the right strategy for the company going forward. But I'd just like to talk about the guidance for FY'11. You're saying that EBITDA is going to be down because of high costs in terms of sales and marketing and retention and acquisition and that sort of thing. But to me the flat sales number looks pretty optimistic given the price raise that you've flooded through over the last 6 months across your 3 pieces of product area, the fixed line, mobiles and wireless broadband. So if you could talk about that please.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I guess just on the strategy, you've talked about the challenges facing the company in terms of the PSTN decline, the fixed to mobile migration, the product mix changes, et cetera. I remember that we pretty much heard the same thing back in September 2005. Since then you've invested over $20 billion of capital in the business. EBITDA has gone from 10.6 billion in '05 to 10.8 in FY '10. Dividends have declined. Just wondering if you could talk about what message you have for shareholders there in terms of, was the investment misdirected or is it just basically the tough industry dynamics which are facing you as the incumbent?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just a question on June, sorry, July trading, which I think you've touched on briefly. But in terms of subscriber performance, if you could talk about maybe the improvement in particular in mobiles and wireless broadband and what you've seen on the physical side? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. The first question was around the guidance on revenue for the full year '11 being flattish. We have been, tried to take a pretty conservative view on revenue. Yes, the PSTN decline, if you look at the numbers for full year '10, PSTN declines were higher in the second half. So but we did see some SIO reduction in decline in the latter part of the second half. Mobiles came out of the year, firstly postpaid stronger, wireless broadband was strong. We still have a lot of work to do in Pre-Paid and if you look at our numbers, our Pre-Paid Mobile performance is not where we need to do it. And that's why we put new product into the market, first time we've put cap plans into the market. So yes, we are not overly, we're not being too optimistic in terms of top line growth; we're saying flattish. But we think that's about right at the moment. So we think that's a fair assessment we're at and we've done a lot of work to try to get that right.</p>
          <p>Second thing about the strategy and past investments. Well it's very important to know, to understand, we've got to respond to the market as I see it. I mean, you can look back and you can say, I mean I personally look at the investment we made, that positions us incredibly well with a great IP network and a great wireless network. Now we've got to take advantage of that but prices have moved enormously, behaviors have moved far faster than we expected. You are right, we have known these &#x2013; these trends are not new, but they have accelerated in the last 12 months. That's why we had to reset things through the year. Now these things happen, you've got to face them, take decisions and that's what we are doing. It's not always easy but if you don't do it, you can get to a worse position. So we are very clear on this strategy. We must go after new customers and an improvement in the business.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of July, I might let John, do you want to handle any of the results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean in July we're seeing the continuation of May, June I guess. So May, June has seen increasing fixed broadband customers, the continuation of strong wireless broadband, better performance in mobile. PSTN, sort of about the same trajectory or just slightly better with some impact of, small impact of T-Hub and so on. So that's how May, June and July is similar to the May, June era. I might just say something about the flattish as well. I mean, when you've got the continuation of the product mix change, and we're not assuming a huge turnaround in PSTN here, that does put, continue to put pressure on your top line and it is the reason that I said before, we need to take other costs out of the company through the simplification program that Robert is leading.</p>
          <p>So the mix change will continue and it does put the pressure on the top line. And we're not assuming that there won't be a response from the competition during the year. So if we're going out after market share, we are not expecting the competition to sit there and say well go ahead, it's fine. So there will be some more price pressure. So that's also built into the go forward plan. So and this is about, last year we lost share, this is about stemming the loss and winning some share. And it is an investment in that. It's an investment in variable costs in particular and it's the dominant part of the cost in for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's take one more from the &#x2013; we'll take one more from the phone I think. Ian [Ian Martin, RBS], are you there?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I also have a question on the guidance in the sense that you've described this additional cost coming through next year as an investment. It's perhaps on the order of 800 million taking EBITDA margin down to 40%. But you don't seem to be willing to share that, if there is an investment, there's got to be a return there, and what the substance of that return might be. John you at least said that you expect an improvement from 2012. Can we take that that you know if the EBITDA margin resets at say 40%, that you'll be able to grow that margin again from then? Or again is it an improvement against what an unspecified case might be if we're in this IP environment where margins keep sliding. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, David, going to the Heads of Agreement with NBN Co., you've mentioned the leasing payments comprise 40 to 50% of the 9 billion consideration from NBN, but 2 of the 3 components you mentioned there, the exchange space and the backhaul aren't access network items. Are they a substantial part of that 40 to 50% or is it predominantly the duct space?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The attempt to get us to say more about guidance. But Ian to &#x2013; I have said as you said, played back to me, we expect improvement from 2012. Improvement means across the board including EBITDA margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right okay. Ian and then let me just add a little bit on guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should say from a reset base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes from a reset base. Ian, we very conscious about driving improved results and we think that if you can drive customer acquisition share, that that's going to flow through. But it changed, you've got to spend to get that increase and we would expect that to improve. But those costs, those variable costs are based on us being successful in the market anyway. So that's the balance we have got at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now I am not &#x2013; I'm just trying to think of the split between the ducts, exchanges, and backhaul. John do you roughly? It's primarily ducts.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Fraser McLeish from RBS. Just a couple of questions, first one on mobile margins. I am just wondering within your guidance, whether you are seeing sort of mobile margins being able to be maintained given everything that's gone on in that space? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And then the second one is just on Sensis. If you could just give us a bit of idea of how you look in terms of sales of the book for next year? And maybe an update on how much of Sensis revenues are now online versus the print book please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I'm going to ask Bruce to respond to the second one because he is here and it's always good to get him to talk. Look on, more on margins, we've been pretty pleased with the margins, but yes, we think there's going to be increased price competition there and of course with the capped plans. So we may see some slight abatement in margins, but it's, but the first thing is we've got to get the customers. So that's going to be &#x2013; but not, I don't want to leave you with the impression that it's going to &#x2013; we are not &#x2013; we're going to continue to differentiate. We're going to continue to be basically faster greater coverage so we can differentiate our product. But we are going to be competitive and in terms of pricing and so there may be some slight abatement in margins, but.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the mobile margins have gone 30, 34, 35, over the last 3 years. So it's slowing.</p>

          <p>For every mobile services and the unit cost of wireless broadband and data over mobiles is very important. And again, going back to the earlier question about what the transformation gave us, Next G is a far more efficient, lower unit cost delivery mechanism than we had before.</p>

          <p>42 megabits we'll have fourth quarter this year. We're increasing coverage. We're now at 2.1 million square kilometers. I mean it's a very compelling product. I do want to just stress on costs as well. We are really focused on costs. I mean, look, Robert and John and I and the whole team, we are going through every bit, because we've got to get the cost base down, but we've got to change the way we do it to run the business. Because if you don't, it just comes back in another way. So we've got to reengineer every process to get that cost out so we can invest in the market and growing. We are in this transition as we go through the next year to get that. But I don't know how strong to say it, it is we are looking at every bit, there is no stone will be left unturned in this company, so that's a big focus. Now, what was the &#x2013; Bruce, Bruce on Sensis, yes, because Bruce is being.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Sensis we had a, about a 5% decline in the print product this past year, you know a print market that declined by about 18%. We get about some 25 million users of our print products every week, so it's a very well-used product and we kept our customer base intact there. So we are looking as the market improves for the print product, and we sell that value proposition to our customers, to recover somewhat. Our digital products, we get about 20 million users a month, 25 a week for print, 20 million a month in digital. And the mobiles thing has been an amazing area. We are getting about 3 million a month and that's growing at about 80%. So the mobile side is really taking off. So we are seeing obviously a transition of, or proposition from print to digital increase, it's about 20% at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad Clibborn, Credit Suisse, 3 questions this morning. Firstly you're talked about investing for growth, but when we look at all of your product lines across the entire business and what's happening in the industry as a whole, revenue growth is generally slowing. So you're spending 500 million to $1 billion to invest in what is a more slowly growing pie. Can you give us some indications as to how you really expect to get the return on that investment?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you've given us product margins which is good to see, can you, and you pointed out before that you didn't really expect mobile to change that much. So, where can we, and which of those divisions can we expect to see margin decline in FY '11 in line with the guidance reduction?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, implicit in those increasing costs for FY '11, what head count reduction and redundancy costs are in there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'm going to take industry growth, I'll let John take margins, so we can give you a bit more color there and we'll take about productivity and issues as we go forward. Look firstly, I've been very specific in saying we are about customer growth, customer growth, customer growth, customer growth because that is the future of this business. We did see a pickup in mobile's revenue growth in the second half. Fixed broadband was back, PSTN obviously declined, IP is growing. So I mean it's a mixed story across all the products. Our focus is on retaining and growing customers because that gives us the opportunity in the future to do other things. That's the growth we're talking about, that's the improvement we must do now, because you lose them, the cost of acquisition is too high. That's the fundamental strategic issue we've got. So, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />
          </p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well remember we've been losing market share. We've got to get it back up to retain and then we're going to get some more. So that's what we're doing and you can see the numbers, they're pretty keeping. You look at Optus' results, Optus' results still, they're picking up share in mobiles and I don't like it. I don't like it. So we've got to, that's the action we're taking. Do you want to talk to margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, obviously PSTN margins will be under pressure as revenue comes down and it doesn't have a lot of associated directly variable costs with it, right. So as you drop your &#x2013; as you see, margins in PSTN sort of come down from in the high 60s over time down to near the 58% and so that will continue, right, because there's not a lot, as I say, a lot of variable, not a lot of variable costs in PSTN.</p>
          <p>In terms of the DVCs that we will spend next year, a lot of it is in the mobile space. So you just heard David say, we're not traveling all that well against our competition in mobiles and so that's where we've got to focus a lot of attention and a lot of variable costs will be associated with that. And with the price pressure, there will be some pressure on mobile margins. IP and data, probably not too much change, fixed broadband we will continue to leverage our unit cost increases. And again I'll repeat, simplification of the business is about making room for that sort of margin to increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Third one was around productivity, head count reductions. We are not talking about head count numbers, but I can tell you that we are now working through every part of the business as we've already done. We've started to look at spans and layers and Andrea and the team went through that to simplify the management structure, number one. We're now working through every part of the business to see how we can simplify the process so we can do it more productively and we're just going to work through this systematically. Robert is doing it; everything is going to be looked at. We are not making the head count numbers because it's artificial. We'll do what's necessary to get this cost base down, to make us competitive, faster to market, supporting the people who really look after customers. That's what we've got to do and we are on a journey and we are not going to stop until it's done.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning, Mark McDonnell from BBY. Look, yes, it's quite right that you are taking some costs out, but overall this guidance is about an increased cost base and I would like to try and get a little bit more clarity around that. The overarching question is what proportion of the cost increase that we will see in FY '11 is one-off and will disappear in FY '12 onwards. But then more specifically, there are a couple of things that you've identified this morning that are new initiatives, one is the 24/7 call center. I'm wondering if any of those call centers will be offshore, and what sort of cost impacts you were looking at associated with that considerable expansion in personnel and whether you are paying any penalty rates associated with the additional hours of operation. And particularly in respect to that last point, the other initiative that you've highlighted this morning which is weekend call out by technicians, whether there are any agreements in place with the employees or their representatives relating to addition payments associated with those out of normal business hour working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. John, do you want to take the mix of one-time next year and recurring? And let me &#x2013; once you do that, then I'll come back and talk about call centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just a quick sum, Mark, and so you need to take it for what it is. About 30 to 35% of it is one-off and the rest is, they will be ongoing DVCs provided we actually win that market share. And the good news is if we don't, then those costs won't be incurred, but that's not really good news because we want to win market share.</p>

          <p>Yes, okay, well, I mean the labor is &#x2013; the labor increase has got a couple of elements to it next year, one is redundancy increase. But there is a wage increase built in that's 4% so that's approaching $200 million for this company. So there is a couple of elements there that will drive the labor cost in our increase for the year. But as I said, if you were to say it was $1 billion increase, the DVCs element of it costs 60%.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mark yes, both those initiatives you talked about are very important to us. Firstly, the weekend call-out rate is pretty much we've covered off over all our contract negotiations. So that pretty much implies there's no penalty rates there at all and that's been built in to our plan for that part of the business. The 7 by 24 is quite significant. In that situation we continue to look at a mixture of on and offshore mainly with our partners. But as you know, well some of you may not know, if you have a mobile technical problem, you ring us today, you say, we say ring back on Monday morning. I don't think that's very customer centric. So we're going to invest in that. And now obviously you've got to look at how many people you need at any time of the day and we know pretty much what those call rates are and we're going to direct the traffic accordingly. But yes it's some tens of millions of dollars to do this and it's very important in terms of serving our customers.</p>

          <p>Hi David and John. Digby Gilmour from CLSA. I'll just keep it to one question on basic access. Compensation under the Heads of Agreement with NBN Co. rests on the number of access lines you've got connected. So I'm just trying to get a handle on, if this NBN Co. Heads of Agreement is completed, to what extent will you consider cutting access pricing and/or call charges to try and hang on to those lines. So I suppose will the extent of the pricing cuts accelerate from here to maximize that compensation from NBN Co.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not something that we're actively considering. Obviously, we get paid for intercommission line. There are considerations of the relativity of ULL and all those sort of things and household line rental prices and so we have to consider all that in the basic access for a pricing arranging. But it's not something we are actively considering. We obviously want to keep as many as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But a lot of our strategy on the PSTN is bundling, and you will see in our bundles we've got included local calls, national calls, and you know very attractive packages on international dialing. That's where we're going and creating more value for customers and that's the best way with broadband, with the T-Hub, with the T-Box and that gives customers certainty around their spend too. That's a very important part of our strategy and we'll just keep moving that as we go forward to be competitive, so that's where we're going.</p>

          <p>Good morning David, good morning John, and just a question from me on the sustainability of the $0.28. So you refer to free cash flow, but obviously your free cash flow is pre-interest costs, so the net distributable cash flow in FY '11 is going to be anything between 3.5 and 4 assuming sort of 1 billion on interest costs. So basically you're distributing everything that you're generating, is that a safe distribution policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know if it's safe and by the way, yes, I &#x2013; let's not be pre-emptive of the board's decision on dividend. But, I'll repeat what I said. We &#x2013; if it was at its current level, we can do it within franking credit and so it would be fully franked and within our cash flows. So safety? Look, if you look at our financial parameters in any event, so if you mean safety, does it allow you to make other investments. We're well below our financial parameters criteria, you know the 55 to 75 net debt and the gain 7 times interest cover and the 1, 7 to 2 to 1 debt servicing parameters. We're well, we're below the low end, so to borrow to invest wouldn't create a problem for us. So, if that's what you mean by safety and being able to take a different, an acquisitive direction if that was what was necessary for the company, it wouldn't be an issue.</p>

I'm just wondering, if that's the case, why aren't you more optimistic on the revenue outlook for 2011? Because the reason I ask is, back in '06, '07, '08 when Telstra was going after the customers, you did get 4, 5% revenue growth and you did find ways to slow down PSTN declines as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I thought we were running out of time. I think David, I just wonder if transformation once again, given we have just completed a 5 year process. I was just wondering, isn't there going to be a period of  1 to 2 years where you can actually extract some benefits of the previous transformation or are we going to come back to 2012 again and start rolling another transformation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well let me see if I can answer the customer growth one. Well the customer growth one, yes we want more customers. It's purely around customer acquisition as well as when does the revenue flow and at what price. And you've got to offset against your base when you're, seeing you're retaining customers at a lower, possibly lower yield. So it's just the balance there. If we could drive faster revenue growth we'd be delighted. But at the moment we're just saying hey, we think flattish makes sense for now.</p>
          <p>Second one about the transformation and are we going to be back in 2 years. Look the, the 5 year transformation has been great. I mean it really has given us a great platform from which to go forward. Different issues we're facing now. From what we can see over the next 2 to 3 years, we think we're, yes pretty much characterized what we need to do and I think we've got a good feel for what costs we need to take out, how to drive the productivity, how to do that and how to compete. So, you can never say never, but we think this is a pretty well considered set of plans and outlook at the moment. John I mean do you want to add anything?</p>

          <p>So there's &#x2013; and one thing we haven't talked about &#x2013; we've talked about sort of the investment that you're seeing expense line that is EBITDA impacting. Part of what Robert is doing in the simplification of the company is actually some capital investment too. It just so happens that we're doing a similar thing that we did in 2005 is we're reprioritizing capital. So simplifying the business requires some capital, but it's still within the 14% CapEx to sales range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, thanks for the question. It's just around the mobile market dynamics, both wireless broadband and the rest of the market. And obviously in wireless broadband you're doing very well. Just wonder if you had any comments about any capacity concerns, what are the customers doing in terms of average download, is there any change there. And just in looking at obviously the remainder of the market, you've lost probably about 150,000 net adds in the half. You've made comments about Pre-Paid, is that all being driven by Pre-Paid or if you could just comment on some of the dynamics of your kind of traditional voice mobile market at the moment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, let me give you the numbers. Firstly total mobile's up 175,000 in the half, Pre-Paid was negative 103,000. But we, as John said, we have a very strict policy about disconnecting or not counting Pre-Paid as he said so we're negative 103,000, postpaid was up 278,000. Wireless broadband total was 329,000 up, wireless broadband prepaid up 106,000, wireless broadband up to 223,000. So we actually think that's, it's improving from where it was in the first half and definitely a lot of that flowed in the fourth quarter of the financial year. So that's pretty encouraging. What are we seeing in the mobiles market? Well, obviously iPhone 4 came in, the supply constrained, lots went, we were there. Midnight Thursday we were all out there selling them and cleaned out straight away. In terms of user behavior, definitely strong movement in terms of movement to mobiles. Minutes of use were up what John?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're seeing stronger there. In terms of wireless data usage, interestingly the average use on an iPhone is around 400, yes, 200 to 400 megabits per month. Nowhere near what people are actually acquiring on their cap, that's an iPhone. And also we are seeing, we've got very good efficiencies in the network. Remember we've put the backhaul. Remember, when you look at wireless performance, it's the base stations, it's the spectrum, it's the backhaul and how your RANs are performing and of course speed. But in terms of cost and how much headroom, we are pretty comfortable about the Next G network. We've got good efficiencies, good, we look at unit cost on the network a lot. And the guys are engineering it very well. So at the moment we are feeling pretty comfortable that we got quite a bit of headroom.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So quite a big minutes use. Remember when you look at the wireless network, 10% of the traffic is, well actually less than 10% now, is voice, 90% is all are IP packets of data. So, that's where the growth is and any, if you are profiling any network, it's definitely around the data. Hope that gives you a bit of color.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I just have a question around the T-Hub. You mentioned that you have 60,000 subscribers on that. When you look at investing into the digital home, I'm just wondering if one of the options you're looking at is more heavily subsidizing those boxes and the T-Box to get them into as many homes as possible. And I just wonder how you're looking at that strategy. Is that at all for any revenue enhancement or is that pure churn reduction?</p>
          <p>And I guess just following on from that, the PSTN revenue decline of 9% in the second half, just wondering, first of all wondering what you're assuming in your guidance for FY '11, whether we assume that that run rate is maintained. And also how much of a critical mass do you think you need to see with products like the T-Hub before you can say that that churn reduction have an effect on your PSTN revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just take you through. The 60,000 was T-Hub and T-Box units sold and it's roughly 43 to 17,000 &#x2013; 43,000 T-Hub, 17,000 T-Box. Why we are doing it? Well, it is about definitely customer acquisition. But we're going after, I mean, customer retention, it's definitely also about acquisition of new customers. Would we use a subsidy? Well, I think you're seeing from our willingness to invest in DVCs, we'll be considering anything that is going to drive a good return for us. We are not announcing that, but we will look at all options as we go forward. In terms of the PSTN decline second half negative 9%, I think it would be right &#x2013; we won't, can't give you the exact numbers, but we are assuming similar-ish. John what would you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, over the whole year we are expecting some improvement. But not huge improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not huge improvement, yes. I think we've got, I mean, remember a lot of this is as John showed you, it's a mixture of SIO &#x2013; the changing access SIOs and usage and that's the big one. Usage has been high, but I think we've got some good strategies there as we've bundled up the plans and just the early signs of improvement, but it's just too early to declare too much on that.</p>

          <p>We'll come back to Sidney now for 3 final questions, Sameer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Sameer Chopra from Merrill Lynch. Two questions, one on the dividend. So the franking credit balance running at about minus 138 million, I wanted to understand what's more important for the company, a fully franked dividend or would you be happy to cut the dividend because the franking credit balance is running negative and likely to accelerate into next year? That's kind of one. The second one is CapEx and D&amp;A, CapEx now appears to have stabilized at about 14% of sales, D&amp;A is higher. I'm wondering at what stage do you expect the D&amp;A to map with CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John do you have since financial ones are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sure, sure. On the dividend, I mean the $0.28, we're all making assumptions of our $0.28 so again I want to not be pre-emptive about the board. The franking credit, to answer your question, we would prefer to fully frank dividends. And this is a board that is not inclined to drop dividends, right. But sometimes you have to make those decisions and I try not to be too pre-emptive here, but fundamentally what David said before is the board is very focused on that return to shareholders. And it's not quite right to assume that the franking credit will get worse. The facts of life is on balancing it as at a level where we don't incur any taxation penalties and we pay sufficient tax before we frank. That's the balancing act that occurs. And so that really reflects in my first statement, our objective is to fully frank.</p>
          <p>Second question was about CapEx to sales and the 14%. I said in the medium-term and excluding any spectrum payments and spectrum can come up at any time depending when governments decide to go for auctions and so on. Depreciation will go up in this year again slightly but we &#x2013; and so in the medium term we expect that CapEx to sales to remain about 14%. So, we are expecting some growth in the future years. So the absolute CapEx will go up a bit. D&amp;A is going to stay pretty close to where it is over the next few years. So, where CapEx is what, 3.5, it'll be a fair while before there's a crossover of CapEx and D&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Andrew Levy, Macquarie. There is a lot in the structure of the business now that revolves around customer service, so obviously the executive level is getting measured quite critically by it and it looks like that's going to run a lot deeper through the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if you could talk to, A, how it's being measured for Telstra. But B, also, how you, how the company looking at what's happened historically, perhaps has looked at to performance going forward for shareholders obviously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes and a really good question because, does improved customer service really deliver bottom line results. Well, look, we have looked at it and we are absolutely convinced that there is a very strong correlation especially for an incumbent, especially for incumbent. If you are an attacker, a challenger it would be a different set of parameters. But it's very interesting what happens. If you give better customer service, besides you get less complaints and driving costs on a whole lot of things into the business, so that's one side of the it. A customer's propensity to change does drop and that's a very important thing.</p>
          <p>The second thing is, if you have a good customer experience with a provider, your propensity to buy other products goes up enormously. Because if you're happy with the service you get, you say well, look if they are offering IPTV or they are offering other products, your propensity to take 3 and 4 products, enormously high. They are the things that we are driving to and very, very important. So we see a direct correlation between customer satisfaction and improved results. It is not just to make us feel good, okay, that's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, in terms of how we measure customer satisfaction. I mean unlike the financial services industry where there's external surveys, we run a very strict survey internally independent of the business units. And so it's run within corporate and it is a survey that covers consumer, business and enterprise, including wholesale customers and we run it every month and it is an overall customer satisfaction score for the service you've receive from Telstra for the prior 3 months. And we measure this. The way we have incented, it's in the short term incentive for every executive. I just got to say except me, but that doesn't change it, because I'm very passionate about it. And every person who is on full-time staff, across the businesses, of course the staff don't get it as part of their incentive, it's actually just an accelerator for them.</p>
          <p>It's run every month. The guys look at it, every customer that comes in who, there we follow up, it's a very rigorous process. We do also look at net promoter score, but that's early days on that. We're just sort of slowly starting to move through that. The enterprise market is probably more sophisticated in that area and we're just trying to move that through in the consumer business. But yes we've, it is a very rigorous program.</p>

          <p>So the reason that it's in the STIs is because it's a leading indicator to like at some of the other performances?</p>

          <p>Absolutely yes. And it's a very big strategic decision. It's a significant part of STI. Not a small part. It's not just 10% or so, it's a big part and that's because we've said this is our number one objective. And we are really going to go after it and you know our success will be dependent on how well we do it and then hopefully the business revenue and profit applies from there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you. I'd like to come back to the carve out on your CapEx guidance relating to the non-inclusion of future radio frequency acquisitions. Well I shouldn't just say future, it's actually, a lot of it's rollout, rollover. And given that the, on past experience, the magnitude that those outlays can be an upfront cash consideration of 1 to $2 billion and that that can then recur for different tranches of spectrum over different years, it's implications for your dividend policy and your free cash flow position are of course quite material. Given all that, I'm wondering if you could outline your attitude to the funding of that very considerable carve out from your CapEx guidance? And in particular whether you would debt fund the payment to the government for additional spectrum, and if you did debt fund it, would you repay that debt within the term of the license?</p>

          <p>John, do you want to get that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, if we &#x2013; well, some of these license are per annum payments. Some may be &#x2013; so new spectrum for example, which may come on the market or likely be, not sure yet, but likely be auctioned. So, some of it we pay per annum now, right. It's embedded in the expense base of the company to pay an annual fee for spectrum licenses. Depending on how much it is of course, we would more than likely debt fund it if we didn't have the sufficient cash flow. It depends a little bit on when it occurs, right. So, you see our cash guidance for this year. But, as I've said, we expect all parameters to improve from 2012 onwards so it does depend on how much it is. But if it requires some debt funding, it's unlikely we would put the dividend at risk to fund spectrum, right, so we would debt fund it. The period of time would depend on the whole big maturity profile. I mean for a 4 to 6 year average maturity profile and so I would fit it into that maturity profile target.</p>

          <p>Great, yes thanks Ben. Well thanks for your time this morning. As you can see, we've tidied up the team, but we're going forward in terms of looking at how we can really move this business forward in terms of growth, in terms of improving response. But full year'11 is going to be an investment year, a transition year. I want to stress the importance of the cost out, the cost focus. We have a lot of work to do there and that's off and running and we feel comfortable about that. But we are about customer growth, acquiring customers, retaining customers and we're off and doing it. So thanks very much for your time and we look forward to catching up with some of you. Thank you.</p>
