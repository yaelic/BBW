        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Ramadorai and Mr. Mahalingam will begin with a brief overview of the company's performance followed by a quick Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, TCS does not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Furthermore, anything said on this call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be viewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. These risks are outlined on the second slide of our results presentation.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David, and let me start by the entire performance of the year '07, '08, before I go into the quarter and then the &#x2013; what we see as '09 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We have completed a strong and a satisfying year starting from 1st of April, '07 to 31st of March, '08. Revenues have grown by 22% in terms of &#x2013; rupee terms to 5.7 billion in terms of dollar terms. And there is an addition of $1.5 billion during the course of the financial year. In terms of dollar terms, this translates into a growth of 33% growth. This means in terms of organic growth, we have posted a good growth despite having the largest base.</p>
          <p>More specifically, U.K. has crossed $1 billion in revenue this year and Europe contributed to over half a billion, both markets exhibiting some growth while the U.S. has kept its share of revenues at about overall 50%.</p>
          <p>India continues to be a strong growth market for TCS, growing at about 22% on an equal footing with our international business.</p>
          <p>Despite the strong headwinds from the currency and other external factors, profits have crossed $1 billion for the first time and are at about $1.25 billion for the full year. We have seen growth across all verticals and markets and Chandra will provide some more details on this.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the rupee, we have managed the situation very well over the year. When the rupee appreciated by 11% yielding a total revenue loss of about 1,850 crores and Maha will delve into these aspects.</p>
          <p>Our employee base has crossed 111,000 level and Ajoy Mukherjee would certainly be articulating that and he's an old timer at TCS but new to the HR function.</p>
          <p>We continue to maintain our aggressive dividend payouts with a payout in the range of 30%. That's what we announced today at the board meeting.</p>
          <p>Now coming specifically to the quarter four, the growth was 2.8% in quarter four. This is muted. This is due to delays in projects for specific customers in terms of ramp up and we have expressed some caution in the past. We did not, during this period, reduce any capability in terms of people and the ramp ups. And capability and capacity buildings for the future, which means in terms of infrastructure creation for the future as the business momentum is there through deals won and the pipeline looks definitely healthy.</p>
          <p>This reflects in our quarterly profits in terms of audits. However, as you know we do not give any guidance either on a quarterly or an annual basis. But overall for the year, I articulated the total growth and the total profits that were generated.</p>
          <p>I believe we will reap the benefits of the investments we are making to help our customers. As we go forward in the next financial year, whether it is to help them from cost rationalizations, vendor consolidations will definitely take place. Our transformation projects through the capability building we have done.</p>
          <p>Capacity building, we are investing in infrastructure, making significant investments in our new infrastructure, 11 different cities adding almost 30,000 seats  for the year '09 in India.</p>
          <p>We also inaugurated our domestic delivery center in Cincinnati, Ohio with a capacity of 1,000 people. Our customers are certainly excited about using this new facility.</p>
          <p>We will continue to make our investments and open up new research and technology use, as well as build excellence in people to put us in a positive momentum for growth next year and beyond.</p>
          <p>When I come to the '09 and what we see, we are confident about the growth prospects based on momentum and the capacity capability building. But we will continue to watchful about the external environment, especially in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our full service as been declared and articulating during the course of the year will drive growth in major markets, whether it's the U.S., U.K., Europe. Our investment in emerging markets will drive growth as well.</p>
          <p>On the talent side, we plan to have between 30 to 35,000 in FY '09. We already made 22,450 offers made for the entry-level professionals to join in this year. And we foresee salary hikes to the extent of around 10% for the India-based employee and three to 4% for the international-based employees.</p>
          <p>Over to Maha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ram. I would like to reiterate what Ram said. We have exhibited strong performance in FY 2008, growing 23% in rupee terms to  226 billion. As you know, growth was impacted by an approximately 11% appreciation of the rupee.</p>
          <p>Our geographical diversification strategy is paying off. While our largest market, the U.S. and U.K., continue to grow in absolute value terms, the emerging markets are helping us to accelerate our growth rate.</p>
          <p>During FY 2008 the emerging market grew, including APAC, Latin America, India and Middle East and Africa, came to almost $1 billion in revenue or about 20% of company's revenue.</p>
          <p>APAC and Latin America in particular grew stronger than the company average at 44% and 52% respectively in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
          <p>As expected and as we have said in our earlier interaction, our Q4 revenue growth was somewhat muted. Q4 grew 2.9% in rupee terms over Q3. We don't believe this lower growth is a risk to our client portfolio after the medium term growth potential.</p>
          <p>We have maintained a consistent focus on growing with profitability. Prudent financial and treasury management allowed us to largely offset the impact of significant headwinds as well as provide investment for future growth.</p>
          <p>Unusually strong headwinds on top of continued ongoing investments and business have impacted the margins this past year. As I have said, rupee appreciation of more than 11% has hit margins by approximately 415 basis points. The annual wage inflation and promotion impacted margins by a total of 315 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at some specific components of the income statement. When examined from a cost of revenue basis we actually improved margins on a full-year basis by 68 basis points from 55.88 to 55.20. This has been accomplished through a variety of measures, including better cost management and increase in the offshore leverage. We have talked about the offshoring impact on numerous occasions. Over the past four years, we have worked with our clients to increase a portion of write down at the offshore location.</p>
          <p>Over the past years, as leverage increased from 40.5%, of revenue generated from offshore locations, to 41.9%, an increase of 1.4%. Underlying this shift is a more significant increase in offshore leverage for our more mature markets such as U.S., offset partially by the initially higher on site &#x2013; the percentage of recent large events.</p>
          <p>Our medium-term target is to drive this overall target to about 45%, as we had said. As a reminder, one percentage should generate up to 25 basis point margin improvements.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at SG&amp;A. During FY 2008, SG&amp;A costs increased as a percentage of revenue by 214 basis points as we were not able to absorb fully the various investments we mentioned above. We have made these investments to diversify our revenues in growing new market to develop new services and solutions and to build new delivery centers globally.</p>
          <p>These investments are already beginning to pay dividends. Above average revenue growth from our emerging markets and from our emerging growth services are helping to accelerate the company &#x2013; overall company growth.</p>
          <p>Our Global Network Delivery Model is increasingly becoming a factor in securing large wins with our clients. Obviously, as these investments continue to gain critical mass and improve results, the margin impact of these investments will improve.</p>
          <p>Finally, net income margin has remained approximately the same at 22% in FY '08 versus FY '07. This is in spite of a margin shortfall in operating margin level of 146 basis points. The key factor in helping to overcome this margin shortfall is the success of our foreign exchange hedge program.</p>
          <p>As we have been saying throughout this past year, to gain a better understanding of the profitability of our operations, the foreign exchange gain and other income should be added back to operating margins.</p>
          <p>Adding the incremental forex gains for FY 2008, operating margin increases from 23.47% to 24.59%. This is close to our full year operating margin target of achieving approximately 25%.</p>
          <p>I would like to take this opportunity to expand on our forex hedging program. During FY 2008, TCS has recorded gains from our hedge program of 1,370 million or 1.37 billion rupees in revenue, and in rupees 2,840 million or rupees 2.84 billion rupees in other income.</p>
          <p>Robustness of our hedging program has been demonstrated in all facets of volatility. That is depreciating currency, appreciating currency, sharp moves and stable currency.</p>
          <p>We have a comprehensive forex hedge program which allows us to maximize protection of our income statements from volatility of currency movement.</p>
          <p>First, this program is long term in nature and has been in place for the last two years.</p>
          <p>Second, TCS qualifies for hedge accounting which allows us to effectively match the gains of our hedging program to offset the negative impact of an appreciating rupee.</p>
          <p>Third, all our contracts are mark-to-market on a quarterly basis, gains or loses are then booked EBIT revenue or other income for contract closed out during a particular quarter, or to other comprehensive income for contracts that are outstanding and are max against future exposures.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we use predominantly option contracts and not forward. This allows us to ride the volatility of currencies and take care of different market scenarios.</p>
          <p>We are confident that our comprehensive and proactive program will continue to assist us in managing the volatility that arises from foreign exchange fluctuations. And achieve the benchmark rates as decided from time to time.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have faced many challenges during FY 2008. I believe that we still have room for further improvement. To reiterate the key points about the market impact of the numerous investments that we are making will continue to improve the offshore leverage will increase over time and the cost improvement program will continue to leverage our SG&amp;A. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Nelson. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from the line of Divya Nagrajan from GM Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm going to reconcile the growth numbers in terms of volume and pricing during the quarter. Could you just give me those numbers please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, for this quarter, the volume growth is 4.8%, and the pricing declined by 1.6%, and there was an impact of, first, due to off shoring about negative 1.4%. Exchange, 1.1% positive; that's the impact this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. By volume growth do you mean the overall consolidated volume growth or does it exclude the domestic business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are all consolidated growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. I am also trying to understand the kind of pricing that we are seeing in the current scenario. Do you see any down tick in the pricing, the pricing that we are seeing this &#x2013; the kind of renegotiations that we've had this quarter? What are your clients saying on the pricing scenario?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'll try to explain that in two parts. One is the pricing decline this quarter, the 1.6%. See, basically what has happened is that in this quarter, you've had some situations where we have had to ramp up and do some few transitions. That has happened this quarter. That actually shows you multiple forms. One is the decline in pricing, then we also see it in the higher utilization towards the end of the quarter and then also you see some of that impacting the cost of revenues in the cost of revenues in employee cost. And going forward, the pricing is pretty stable. For new contracts, it is stable with an upward bias. For existing contracts, it is stable. That's what I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>By stable, you mean stable over the fourth quarter or stable for the full year '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stable over the full year. Event if the fourth quarter impact is due to the factors that I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That was helpful. And just one more question, in terms of the service mix we've seen a decline in terms of the higher value added services this quarter as well as decline in ADM. How do you see this service mix going into FY '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just suggest that you take the service mix and all the metrics for the whole year because this quarter the growth has been &#x2013; it's a very small growth. So I think dissecting it and then making conclusions would be misleading. All I would say is that the new growth services have done phenomenally well. If you look at BPO, infrastructure and assurance, together they have done 947 million this fiscal. And if you include consulting to this it's about 1.1 billion. So, the new growth services are growing at a much faster rate than the company average. And that will continue going forward in the next fiscal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just one last question. This quarter we've seen the strongest growth come from the U.S. at around 2.9% in dollar terms. While the other geographies, U.K., Europe, even India has gone down, what is the reason for that? Is there any particular phenomenon that happened this quarter that led to this kind of downturn? Because across the years we've seen that the U.S. has been a slow growth area while the others, Europe especially, has done well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, actually the ramp ups in the U.S. that we anticipated did not happen this quarter, otherwise this quarter should have done well. In this quarter the contribution is primarily in the U.S. is due to some of the fixed price engagements. We've been able to complete and then recognize some revenues in those engagements. And then the offshore shift has also happened in some large contracts in the continental Europe and U.K. But again, as I said the total growth is certainly small but disaggregating it will be misleading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure thanks. I'll  come for questions later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Nagarajan. The next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I just want to make sure I understand the sequential weakness in the revenues here. Relative to the rest of your competitors at this point in time, you guys are actually reporting the lowest sequential growth number. So if you wouldn't mind just disaggregating those components one more time, so that it's very clear to us what the drivers were in the sequential revenue growth, the weakness in it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. See, if you look at the IT spend pattern, it varies based on the geography, based on the industry and some specific clients. For TCS, what has happened is, every quarter we have the plans that ramp up some time in material contracts because certain middle contracts immediately give revenues and the fixed price contract, which we closed the previous quarter, we get revenues based on the percentage completion method. And what has happened in this quarter is, specifically with some clients in the financial services sector and two other clients in the U.S., the ramp ups did not happen because they've had issues with their budgets. And those ramp ups did affect our revenue flow. We did indicate this in some form in the financial analysts meet when we met them in February. And that had an impact on the revenue trajectory.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have been closing a lot of deals in the previous quarter as well as in the current quarter, we have closed fixed deals of 50 million plus, two of which is more than 250 million plus. That's the kind of deal flow we have had and the ramp ups have started happening. So we did not take any measure to cut down on any of our capacity building measures. We continue to recruit, continue to train and continue to take on projects and do the transition et cetera. So the trajectory for the expense line has not dipped corresponding to the dip in the revenue trajectory, and that is the impact that we are seeing in the margin drop for this quarter. But suffice it to say that since we have a good deal flow and good ramp ups happening at this point in time, we are pretty confident of it in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I mean I don't understand the confidence because the other clients &#x2013; I guess first of all, the BFSI client as opposed to two other clients that did not happen in the quarter, what's the current status on those clients today? Are they ramping? Are they not ramping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two things. One is that some of those revenues will come in the subsequent quarters, not all of those revenues will come in Q1 or Q2. Some will come in Q1, some will come in Q2. And the reason is, to be very specific, for each client the situation varies. In one client, they've postponed up to the second quarter. In the other clients, they have started ramping on those projects, in fact, we are beginning to stop those projects. So it varies from each one of those clients. But the point I am making is that we are also deploying some of those people who we planned for ramp up in those clients into other projects which we have won. And that's the kind of ramp up which is happening in all other engagements, in manufacturing sector, in retail sector, in pharma and also in financial services we have closed two other contracts, and those contracts we are ramping up those people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how quickly on the new deals, the new deals that you're talking about, are those expected to ramp? Are those Q1 or Q2 events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, we have started ramping up in March and some of it is going in the transition phrase, in fact we have agreed pre-transition. So those revenues have not come in this quarter. And some part of the first quarter also, the revenues will not flow in. But middle of the first quarter those revenues will flow in. So you will see that revenue impact, some of it in the middle of Q1 and some of it in Q2.</p>

          <p>Should we expect any sequential growth into the first quarter based on the moving parts here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't view specific guidance about our quarter or the year, but all I can tell you is that the environment is good. We have closed deals and we are on a ramp up mode.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Finally, can you just go back through, you said that volume was positive 4.8; pricing was negative 1.6, and then you gave a couple of other elements. Can you just walk through those again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the basic element for the volume was 4.8, pricing was 1.5 negative. Therefore, we should shifted more work also, almost 120 basis points we shifted from Q3 to Q4 offshore on our yearly basis we shifted 150 basis points, and that resulted in a 155 basis point different revenues. And the exchange in backlogs, 117 basis points positive because the rupee depreciated this quarter against dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's on a fiscal basis or on a quarterly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a quarterly basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Quinteros. The next question is from the line of Mr. Sandeep Shah from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Can you just give the volume growth in the international business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think the growth in the international business and the domestic business, if you really look at it, have not varied much, so there will hardly be any difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you throw some light in terms of the onsite utilization quarter-on-quarter in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The utilization, we measured for billable projects, we don't report onsite separate, offshore separate because we cannot move people.  And the overall utilization at the end of the quarter is 39.1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to reiterate that we don't keep a bench onsite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. I just want to have color whether it has dipped or increased quarter-on-quarter. Okay. The next question is on the BFSI. If you exclude the insurance, can you throw some light &#x2013; how's the growth in the BFS part of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, as I said in BFS we have had a business situation, we have specific clients in the banking and financial services sector in the U.S. where we have had ramp up challenges, and the expected growth has not been delivered. So if you isolate the insurance sector, the share of the BFS will slightly dip.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So insurance segment has grown quarter-on-quarter in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually absolute numbers, I think there is no problem, but in terms of the share, I think the dip will be only in the BFS sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And tell me. Is there any reclassification in the travel expense within cost of any revenue and the G&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there has been a reclassification. So what we did was that instead of taking it to other quarters and so on, this has been taken in just this quarter. And that is why you find us having increase in one place and decrease in another place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one should assume this trend here? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As far as our annual is considered, if you had a positive fourth quarter revenue there is no problem, but just that we gave effect to it at one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the rental expenses have increased. Is it the trend one should continue assuming going forward? Like 1.1% has gone up to 1.5 in this quarter within cost of revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rental has been, it is a question of will rental continue to go up? No, the answer is no. But the rental expenses have gone up in this particular quarter because new facilities have come in and we have expanded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, because you grossed around 1% for the last five quarters and certainly down to 1.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are at this level and the absolute numbers, we are very careful about, in terms going for more rental places because a lot more facilities are coming, our own facilities are coming up. So the absolute amount will ensure a slow growth, but at this moment in time, we are about 1.5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The next question is from the line of Miss Natalie Gosh from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good evening. Just wanted to understand on the large deal pipeline, what are the kind of &#x2013; what is the size and what is the pace of discussions and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Natalie, the large deal pipeline, we have mentioned that there 25 deals of 50 million plus we are pursuing. And it is thoroughly well distributed across the market and across industries. We are pursuing deals in telecom; we are pursuing deals in financial services, retail, manufacturing, utilities and also in life sciences and pharma. So it's a very diversified portfolio, and also the &#x2013; across markets, U.S., Europe and the continental Europe and U.K. and also some of the emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you sort of find the addition to the pipeline having slowed down a bit? And I think there's a number of 30 mentioned earlier in February. Are there delays in decision-making and are you seeing more competition from some of the larger players there, the global players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, actually this quarter we have closed six large deals and actually apart from that we also closed one large deal in the TCS financial services BaNCS business unit. So, on the services side, six large deals and one on the financial services and this is a first also we closed. So I think the closes are happening and as I mentioned a couple of them are very good size. So I don't think that there is an impact on the deal pipeline or in slowness in decision making.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and just on the &#x2013; while you don't give guidance, I mean, just in terms of the next few quarters, is it fare to assume that this will be a significantly back ended kind of year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a question tough to answer because I'll end up giving you guidance. But basically what we are saying is that from our point of view we have started ramping up on some of the contracts that we closed in March and our Q4, very much dependent upon the ramp-ups of few financial services clients. And whereas going forward, the plan also takes into account some of the clients in other sector. So there's going to be growth but how much back-ended that is something that I cannot comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And one final question on the campus offers that you have made, what is -- in the eventuality that let's say the market sort of slows down more than anticipated, what is the scope one has to sort of delay some of these joining dates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take that and just say that we have, as you've mentioned, we have offered 22,450 offers through the various technical campuses. And at this stage we do not see or we do not anticipate any delay as far as the joining dates are concerned, which is what are our business strategy. So that is what I wanted to come out and if you look at past, we have never delayed any joining and we have kept our promises and kept our offers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And just in terms of pattern of joining, is that sort of spread out or should one be expecting most of them to join in 2Q and 3Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah so they -- maybe take the trainees when they come in, initially they go through training programs. So that is the way we do it. And so when they come in they will be done from quarter to quarter, they will be back and they will go through this training and that will be the scenario through which they will enter the organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Gosh.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  The next question is from the line of Anthony Miller from Arete Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm a little bit worried about the pricing trends because I hadn't expected to see a 1.6% drop this quarter. That is, I think you're the only one of the companies that I've met that's have announced so far that actually saw their revenues go down by quite that much.  So what is it then that gives you the confidence of what is now a far more muted comment you're making on pricing as you're saying stable for renewals and stable with an upwards bias for the new contracts?  Why are you confident that pricing won't actually go down over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time we are basically commenting based on what we are seeing.  We have closed six deals this quarter, and we are negotiating some renewals.  And the new contracts that we have closed have been closed at a price that I indicated.  That's basically average or average price plus with an upward bias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because you said that one of the reasons why pricing was lower this quarter because you were doing some I think you said pre-transitions.  And if you're sort of closing the large numbers of deals why wouldn't these continue and therefore why wouldn't effective pricing in fact come down?  Is pre-transition something new and something peculiar to the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it depends on the size of the deal.  If the deal size is very large then we work out the transition, pre-transition. Then what is the investment that we have to make in pre-transition, and then we determine our overall pricing based on that.  The clients are okay with that.  So the pricing with which we closed, the total impact for everything all kinds of expense whether, we are making an investment in transition. Sometimes we make investment in communication links.  See there are different aspects to the deal.  We factor everything into the pricing, so the net pricing --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, do carry on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So net, net pricing impact is what I'm telling you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because you also alluded to attrition, and I did notice attrition track up this quarter. And again most of your competitors are seeing attrition still trending down.  Why is attrition up this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Attrition, if you look at probably mid-quarter it has gone up marginally. And there are two components of attrition and primarily what we did was some of the post-recruit that we had during this particular year, some of them that came into this particular quarter, then the one that has caused the attrition level to go up marginally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, this was forced attrition from trainees who didn't make it through to qualification, are you saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not only trainees.  We have a very leveraged performance appraisal process within TCS. And it's basically performance-driven culture and it is from non-performance point of view.  That is one aspect that has contributed towards this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.  So are you saying that voluntary attrition -- what is the status of voluntary attrition?  Did that also go up or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Voluntary attrition if you look at it, it's been more or less stable, more or less a decision level that we had in the last quarter.  That area has now gone up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see.  Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Miller.  The next question is from the line of Mr. Pankaj Kapoor from ABN Amro Asia Equities . Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hi.  Just continuing on pre-transition that you spoke of.  This, if my understanding is right, is only for the large deals that you won in this quarter?  Or does this also involve some of our regular contracts or new contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are predominantly for deals we won recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So it could be fair to assume that this is something which is not a precursor to any kind of volume related kind of a discount that clients will be asking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  You're right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And sorry, just a comment again on the outlook that you're looking at for the business in the near term, given that the couple of BFSI client you spoke of not ramping up as planned and some of the other clients also slowing ramp-ups. Is there any kind of a view that in the next couple of quarters we'll continue to see a sluggish growth and pick on later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See Pankaj what we have done is in our planning, we have taken each of those clients where we have had these ramp-up issues.  And we had a realistic ramp-up plan for them across quarters based on the dialogue we've had with them.  So in our business plan for Q1 or Q2, the way we see, we have only accounted for what we think will come at this part in time.  If situation changes, then that's something that we'll adjust accordingly.  But at this point in time we have made our plans as I described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And Maha, just a final question on the margin outlook given the environment that you are having and the outlook that you're building on the pricing and other factors.  What's the take on the margins and where do you see them excluding any kind of FX impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have -- actually talked about the maintenance at QR level. We have done quite well on an annual basis. And SG&amp;A we have indicated certain things with regard to the increase in SG&amp;A.  But given that there are certain moves that are taking place including offshore that I talked about. Yeah, we can manage the margins. What it will be, I'm not going to be talking about right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, enough.  Thank you and all the best.</p>

          <p>Thank you Mr.  Kapoor.  The next question is from the line of Ms. Kanchana Vydianathan from Pacific Crest Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thank you.  I guess my first question is I'm wondering at this point, have you seen any of your existing deals being cancelled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, none of the deals have been cancelled except there is one deal in Chile which announced today that the government has awarded that deal to us. It's $70 million of over 10 years and that deal has been cancelled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with respect to the issues that you're having in the banking financial services, now the client issues that you are seeing, is it only in North America? Or are you also seeing this in the U.K. and Continental Europe, with respect to banking financial services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is only in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just looking at your revenue growth in U.K. for the past few quarters, I mean the sequential growth seems to be pretty muted.  Can you help us understand?  I know you have pretty strong quarters in June and September, but December and March has been quite weak.  What is the reason behind that? And are you expecting a pick-up as the year progresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I've explained the reason for the dip this quarter is the specific client situations as I explained.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even in Europe?  Even in U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in U.K.  You see, in U.K. and Europe primarily this quarter we have  moved some work offshore. I think we have 120 basis points improvement in offshore leverage that have come from the U.K. this quarter.  That's the reason that we're not U.K. and Europe, that's why you're not seeing that.  But we do expect a pickup in the next couple of quarters, yes, next quarter, Q1, Q2, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And one question, I guess with respect to as you're doing your internal forecasting, and I was wondering if you could go back and look at the forecasting maybe that you did at the beginning of the year. And right now if you're going back and revisiting it, have your internal forecast numbers actually come down -- for the revenue growth for FY '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've not revised the FY '09 numbers, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So far, you have been growing above the industry average. And according to NASSCOM the industry estimate is still 24 to 25% year-over-year growth until fiscal 2010. So would it be fair to assume that you would still continue to grow above the industry average?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give any guidance, Kanchana.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Vydianathan.  The next question is from the line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I had a couple of questions.  First on the pre-transition. Is this practice which is consistently followed or is this something restricted to only deals closed out recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't have the specific deals, Saluja.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has been consistently followed. It is a -- the very deal specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is for Maha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also situation specific, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is for Maha. Maha, your receivables days still continues to be pretty high, at around 100 days. And it has, the situation has not really improved over the last two or three years.  Now is there a structural issue out over here? And I just like to know the reason for accounting for that receivables cycle as such?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you do an analysis and so on, there is also -- it's also a function of when the billing takes place.  As you know, we have a mix of time and material and turnkey projects. And this is essentially effects of the total amount that is outstanding at the point in time it gives the total sales and that's how we arrive a result.  Actually the 0 to 30 days bucket, there's a fair amount of outstanding which roughly corresponds to 48 days itself there. We do find the structural issue as far as receivables are concerned.  We do not have too many outstanding beyond 180 days, 180 days bucket, there are some outstandings which we need to collect especially since we deal with a number of government clients and so on at different places.  But there is no structural problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Saluja.  The next question is from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Joan. I wondered if you could give us some color on -- I know you said some contracts have slowed a little bit. Just from a ramp perspective, I know you said you're sort of seeing a ramp now.  Has the decision process or the ability to commit changed within the last month or two?  Maybe giving you a little bit more confidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah as I said it is completely specific client situation.  So except barring those clients where we have had issues, I think there is -- and all other client situations, there are no issues.  And this is primarily in the U.S.  And in those clients where we have this situation I think we can't comment on anything with a lot of certainty because the clients cannot comment on anything loss ultimately.  They are delayed and some clients have started again.  Some have said that it will not happen in Q1, will happen in Q2, so those kind of issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess asking it in a different way, then is it safe to assume that the financial situations or the ability to spend by the client has improved, thus they're starting the projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again it is very client specific. Again in those specific clients where they have issues I can't say that whether it's improved because they are going through this and they are sanctioning ramp-ups on a case by case basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in regards to the model and the operating metrics. The normal thought process would be that if there was a slowdown which it seems the group is sort of showing that in their numbers that the models would adjust. And the way that they would probably adjust is the labor market would cool and we would see wages come in and attrition rates stay pretty stable. And it's also that maybe pricing would be a little bit flat.  Are you seeing any adjustments in your model and/or putting any adjustments and therefore what's going on in the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's an excellent question, but at this point in time, the first thing is that have not slowed down on our capacity building.  So if we see all these signs that you indicated then we'll start slowing down on our capacity building.  At this time in point we are continuing to build capacity -- sorry, continuing to recruit -- as everyone is continuing to recruit, then there is going to be demand on the people and attrition is not going to slow down.  That's something that we are going to watch out for, it is a fair point.  But at this point in time we're not seeing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just lastly, if there is weakness, I know we've pointed towards BFSI and TiVo. Can you categorize maybe the areas where you think we'll see continued weakness? And will that show through in the numbers more next quarter rather than this one because, of course, a lot of the spending decisions were made three months ago?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the sectors where we will see growth of retail, utilities, pharma and I think the financial services outside of the U.S. with also some growth in the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mr. Foresi.  The next question is from the line of B. Singh from Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sir. This is Bhuvnesh from Credit Suisse. I just wanted to understand the slowdown in this quarter. First, did the slowdown come more likely in say the end of the quarter towards the end of March? Or was it more likely that it came by in the beginning, that January onward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely from the towards the end of January onwards -- towards the end of January, early February. That's why we indicated in February when we first saw the sign, February 12th or something we had the analyst conference and we did indicate our caution immediately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Maha, was there a reason that -- if we had two months lead when the slowdown had somewhat begins that we could not adjust our hiring plans or cost plans accordingly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bhuvnesh, you don't do that on a quarterly basis.  I mean as Chandra had also been indicating, we are not really looking to a slow down in FY '09 in any manner. And therefore the hiring plans will continue. See, there are components that you'll have to look at. In Chennai, the employee cost does not go up only because of new additions.  But if someone joins in middle of November.  That person will be getting only one and half month salary in the last quarter.  Whereas in this quarter that person will be getting a three months salary.  So there is automatically going to be an increase.  And also we have certain process of annual appraisal of people who join mid-year and so on. There are certain increments and so on that are coming in. So it's a factor of the full booking if you can call that in terms of one quarter.  There is an additional addition that continued, that we have seen. It is the most robust addition amongst all the IT companies in this area. And that will continue. And there are certain increments and so on when they will complete one year up when they join and so on in between. So many of these factors have taken into account and we have not slowed down on our recruitment of asking people to join.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And one last question.  This quarter there has been somewhat slowdown from Asia also in terms of quarter-on-quarter revenue progression.  Any specific reason or is it just Q-to-Q fluctuations that we are looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not just a fluctuation.  And also one thing that you to have remember is the nature of the projects that we do in the emerging markets, Asia Pacific or India or Latin America, we have more project work.  The percentage of project work compared to annual revenues is significantly different.  Vast majority of them are project work and depending upon the lifecycle of the projects and the efforts we are spending, the revenue recognition will happen.  So it is not a tandem ramp-up situation in these markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir if I may just one last thing.  Do you see any signs that this slowdown can affect outside U.S. maybe U.K. or Europe could also be impacted?  Is that a possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bhuvnesh, we acknowledged you'll ask, so you are in this one.  But at this point in time all we are saying is that we're not seeing that trend but we're going to be very watchful of the situation.  But at this point in time we are seeing a positive pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Singh.  The last question for today is from the line of Mr. Harmendra Gandhi from Lehman Brothers.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question.  In your internal forecast for FY'09, do you think BFSI will grow as well as the company as regular trade or do you think it will underperform the company as a growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harmendra Gandhi again, it will amount to giving guidance, and we don't give guidance for a specific industry or for a geography.  So I can't tell you but the indications are that the U.S. financial sector probably may have an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So do you see it having a larger exposure to BFS may get impacted more than tier one peers?  Is it a fair assumption to make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we also have a good amount of financial services and insurance revenue outside the U.S.  And we have one contract outside, in fact, we announced one large financial services in the last quarter in the U.K. and this quarter we announced a large insurance in the U.K.  So we are -- that is well diversified to handle that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Gandhi.  Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question.  I would like to hand the floor over to the TCS management for their closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And what I wanted to summarize was the yearly performance both in terms of the growth leading to pipeline $7 billion, almost $1.5 billion over the year and the profits exceeding $1.25 million for the entire year has been both good and satisfying as far as we see it.</p>
          <p>The capability building and the capacity building has taken place, and we are continuing to invest for the future both in people and the infrastructure.  And to give you an idea of the number of people we are going to be recruiting including the offers that has already been made in terms of entry-level professionals joining us.</p>
          <p>We will invest in markets beyond the U.S., the U.K., Europe and the emerging markets.  And we will see certain salary hikes around 10% and the momentum and the deal pipeline is fairly good and the utilization was reflected by the end March to 79% or so.  We will continue to focus and stand by our customers as they go through certain challenges but more importantly, we see great partnerships with some of these customers in the future.  Thank you so much for being with us this evening.</p>
