          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Total 2011 Results Announcement Conference Call. All lines will be in a listen-only mode during this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Christophe de Margerie. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I will be standing by.</p>

          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome. My name is Martin Deffontaines and I'm in charge of the IR team. As we do every time in Total, a few words on safety and, to start with, we have in this room three safety exits, one here and two in the bottom of the room, so in case &#x2013; there is no drill scheduled for this afternoon, so in case of alarm, and there is a fourth one on the left at the bottom, so in case of alarm, quietly and safely you follow the green signals.</p>
          <p>I will give the floor to Christophe, and we'll start with the formal presentation and we will manage to give room for our Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon to all of you and thank you for being here to have an open discussion on our Total year results and yearly results and, more than this, our future views and the strategy of our group. Well, first of all, to mention that all the executive members are in this room. Jean-Jacques Guilbaud, who is, in English, what is your title in English?</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:05) g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in French. In no order, Yves-Louis Darricarr&#xE8;re, in charge of E&amp;P and Global Upstream, Patrick Pouyann&#xE9;, in charge of the new division Refining and Chemicals, Philippe Boisseau, in charge of Supply and Marketing and, the last but not the least, Patrick de La Chevardi&#xE8;re, our extremely expensive CFO. They will participate in the debate. We'll try to make it as short as possible so that we can answer in the Q&amp;A and we'll ask the members of the Executive Committee to participate when it is applicable.</p>
          <p>So first the key figures, which is, implementing the new dynamic. 15% in the improvement in our safety records. It's important, and we will back to it with upstream. We are now close to reaching the goals we had which is to join the team of the best in the class, still have some additional improvement to do in the downstreaming, but you will see the upstreaming is now there.</p>
          <p>The production, I'm sure we'll come back on it. Production in 2011 is almost exactly in line with our commitment, 2.35 MBoe/d, and the strong commitment for additional increase in the near term and long term. Three giant discoveries, it's the message in terms of exploration is back, exploration is back in our wish to be more aggressive, more boldness. So here three giant discoveries, they are &#x2013; we have always a discussion with you on the third one because the two first are equal, Azerbaijan, Guyana, the third one is Bolivia, but, I mean we could discuss on some others.</p>
          <p>The important element, the reserve replacement rate, which has been the challenge for our company for many years, close to 200%, that is the figure net of the price effect. That's great, but it's also linked with the policy we have had for now a certain numbers of years. And with the new acquisition we've made recently, proved that it will be for continuity and not just one short rate. The adjusted income plus 17%, $16 billion, it's what it is. It's not a bad result, but we will see that when we compared to certain of our competitors, it's true that we still are a little bit behind. When the price of oil climbs, we still are a little bit behind our competitors. And that's part of the strategy we've had that we've explained to most of you when we presented the Upstream last year. We want to have more and more asset in our portfolio which are more, we say, linked with the price of oil, the same way we are doing it with the price of gas. It's important. It's not yet totally done, but it's on the way.</p>
          <p>And $22 billion net investment, which is in control and we'll come back to it in terms of the commitment of Total to stay at an average of $23 billion net in the years to come. And it means that it's done with a lot of this year's acquisition and divestment. In the years to come, we'll have to make it still at the same level with definitely additional divestments, I come back on it. The new dynamism of Total is there. 50 in an industry like us, if you don't take 50 as really the priority that has been proved by others, we can just say that's not at all our wish and we are doing everything to make it in a clean way. Production growing, exploration bonus, recovering in our reserves, replacement rate is there. The adjusted net income should continue to climb. Definitely for doing this we need investment, a profitable investment and profitable investment with cash.</p>
          <p>The four drivers to deliver upside, remember we've opened the subject of unlocking value. I can tell you that it's something in which we believe. In France that's been a subject of discussion, a little bit difficult to understand what means unlocking value. Unlocking value means you have it under your feet. You sometimes know it, but you don't believe it. Now we know that we can deliver and we have certain areas where it's still doable, LNG and deep offshore, exploration, I said it, the restructuration of the Downstream and Chemicals and definitely a real active portfolio management.</p>
          <p>And what I mean by real and we will say it in details, is that we only sell assets to match gearings or to make the cash flow what it should be, which is, of course, good reasons for selling, but we also want to manage our assets in a way where when we don't see benefit anymore, when we think just there's no upside, we sell it. Which means that we might sell more in one year and less another one, but still it will be under the guidance of the $23 billion net on average. Financial strengths, Patrick will tell you why it's not only words, but we have a gearing which is at 23% by the year-end. We had a lot of additional &#x2013; what do you call <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:39) working capital, but it's under control. We have all the capabilities, I'll come back to it, to meet our commitment in some of investments and the dividends.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence, we are a heavy industry company with a lot of responsibilities, but also a lot of force of profits. It's nice to explore, it's nice to discover, but if you don't develop, no message about other companies, it has no value. So the message is in Total, yes, we can also explore, but we are certainly among the best of the class in the way we are developing our projects with new, innovative technologies and definitely with a clean understanding that we need to make it in a clean way, on purpose these clean points. And increasing cash flow on the period 2011 to 2015, we'll come back to it again.</p>
          <p>So a quick word on what is supporting our strategy, what's important, I've always been clear on this, and until further notice, even for those more pessimistic people in this room I know well, well, until further notice, we are not yet at 70 points. I'm sorry for this, especially when we know that when price of oil is lower, Total is reacting in a better way. But at the end of the day, why are we investing, because we believe in higher prices. So we still are very cautious on the way we use these prices, $100 for long-term plateau, $80 for short-term plateau. We'll come back to it, but definitely today we are at $111 for 2011.</p>
          <p>Today we are, I don't know, I've heard almost at $119; just before we landed it was $118.7. I don't mean I'm pulling it every minute, but I was just checking it before I came. And that's linked today definitely with geo-politics and the weather. But at the end of the day, it's still there and, frankly, I know that a lot of people want it to be lower. I don't know why, by the way, except if they are consumers. But if they are buyers of an energy company's shares, you should appreciate that we need higher prices to make it long-term and profitable.</p>
          <p>And that's the way we see it, because we don't see how it could decline with OPEC, what we call extra capacity going down. And definitely on the top of it, still an increasing demand by 1% per year, that's our estimate, but 1% per year makes it at the end of the day, which is in 20 year's time, a lot of additional oil and the decline, of course, of oil fields, which is normal. Which means on that slide, in eight years' time, as you can see, we need to replace almost 50% of the existing production with 40 million barrels per day. Today we produce 88, and that is linked and coming from, at the same time, additional demand and pick-up.</p>
          <p>Increasing demand for gas, which is good news for those who are moving more and more to gas, which is the case of our company. While you remember, I've discussed it many times, we have more than ever, these three different areas, zones, whatever it is. The U.S. was a very low price, $2.5 per million BTU, the &#x2013; let's say, spot Europe which is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:48), which is raising today to $10 per million BTU, $11 per million BTU. And Asia, which is more than ever, especially after Fukushima, linked to the oil price. And today, the higher oil price is not yet in the price, and we are already selling, we have been selling gas to Japan and some other countries, at levels which I shouldn't even say, but let's say it's more than $17 per million BTU. So, it's almost eight times, or very close to eight times, the price of United States.</p>
          <p>So good news, bad news, it depends for whom. But we continue to consider this as very important for our LNG project. Why LNG? Because LNG is the best way to be able to move from one area to the other one. And, for instance, to move from the states if it happens, we will see this probably soon for us, but to go from low price of gas to higher price of gas. Definitely, we'll continue to increase our share in LNG where we consider that we have a real competitive positioning.</p>
          <p>Performance, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Yes, good morning. Good afternoon, everyone. A strong performance for 2011, mostly driven by Upstream, $16 billion net income, 90% of it coming from the Upstream division at $14.5 billion. The return on capital employed of the Upstream is set at 20%. Downstream, it's more difficult obviously, the return on capital employed is a low, 7%. We faced a very challenging market last year and the 10% return on capital employed for the Chemicals. The overall group return on capital employed is at 16%, and honestly, mostly driven by Upstream.</p>
          <p>What we did last year, we fully repositioned our portfolio. We sold $15 billion of assets during the period 2010, 2011. If we compare Total to its peers, we sold the value of 15% of our capital employed. We are ahead even of BP, and we know why BP was selling assets. We reallocated funds through some acquisitions, $17 billion of acquisitions. We acquired about 5 billion barrel of oil equivalent of resources at a price below $3 per barrel. And something we would like to share with you is that the asset sales is definitely integrated in our strategy today, and it's part of it.</p>
          <p>The cash flow, I know you like it very much. The cash flow for year 2011 was $28 billion, it was $24 billion in 2010, and $19 billion in 2009. This cash flow was used to fund the organic investment that $20.6 billion and, of course, a dividend of $7.4 billion and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:52) acquisition was financed for basically increase of financing. The cash flow was increased by 50% during the period 2009, 2011, and the gearing end of the year was 23%.</p>
          <p>Now, can you come back to the &#x2013; yes. Sensitivity, very quickly, $10 per barrel of Brent is $1.7 billion of cash flow and the net sensitivity I will give you is the divestment of our Sanofi stake, which leads to a $3.2 billion of cash. We own about 3.2% of Sanofi today. And that's for me, the end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Patrick, and I think it's always important to have the CFO delivering the message on performance. On the branches' performances, as Patrick was saying, we start with Upstream. It's not the first one, is it? Thank you. We start with Upstream, and the safety about Upstream. I was telling you that we've been improving our records in the project by 15%. Here just for Upstream, and in Upstream with 1.3 for the GRIR, which is the recordable injury rate. We reached a 1.3 level, which is making Total one of the best of the class. It doesn't mean that we've achieved everything. It's always the most or the biggest of our concern, but definitely, it has been Total lagging for many years behind the others. Today, we are among everybody and I am not allowed to say it, but I will say it.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; at the end of September Total was the number two in terms of this recordable injury rate percentage. Now, what is important, last message, sorry, is message of what we call the post-Macondo. Don't think that Total is not still thinking about it, it's often left on the side, but we consider that it has been a major concern for all of the industry. We have had three task forces, as you know, in place and they are still moving hotly to produce and deliver additional ways to improve the safety of our operation. Even if we think we are good in it, we know that we can still improve on it and especially the impact of potential spills.</p>
          <p>Upstream performance in first production, that's normal. Before talking about the future, you need to talk about what happened. We said that 2011 will be a year of transition, flat. It's not totally flat, but it is without entering into the price effect, the portfolio changes declined. We can talk about this in details whenever you want and especially in the Q&amp;A session, but if you just want to say how we did it with minus 1.3%, it's only with Libya. So Libya by itself is just responsible for the 1.3%, so without Libya, it would have been just flat, the way we said it. And when we come back to it, we have a commitment to increase our production on an average by 2.5%.</p>
          <p>And the cash flow generation, which is a part of our common concerns during this period, we have on one part of the slide the cash flow generation on the realized price, so it's fully realized price of our portfolio, the price at which we sell on an equivalent barrel position plus 32% to give you the figures for those who don't have it, it's 57% for 2010, 75% for 2011 and the same 32% in terms of cash flow per barrel equivalent, which is moving from $22 per barrel of oil equivalent to $29 per barrel of oil equivalent, so it's cash flow well leveraged with the environment.</p>
          <p>On the reserve replacement rate, first the adjusted level at the Brent price at the end of the year. We have now 1P reserve, proved reserves of 11.4 on a billion barrels. There is a debate even within Total to know whether or not it is a historical figure, I believe it is. If it's not, it's by 0.2 or 0.3, but it's a good result definitely. We are moving from 3 years of proved reserve life to 13 years, and as I was telling you, we think we're in the good direction to continue on that way. On the proved reserve replacement rate, after the price effects, we're moving to 1H5. If you want to move to the so-called organic growth, on which we could discuss for length, we have an 85% increase.</p>
          <p>Next. Portfolio of resources, quickly, just to say that by technology, as usual, we are in almost all the areas where there is possibility to access the new reserves, that's what we called the by technology. In terms of region, you can see where it is. But what is more important is that all the acquisitions we have made, and I want to remember you to tell you that when we make acquisition it's mainly to buy resources, sometimes 2P and limited part of 1P. Our role is to move from resources to 1P, so we don't acquire one thing or little. But what is important is our new acquisition. And in more than 40 years now of resources and coming from long-term plateaus, you have the split, but definitely we have been increasing our resources base I think a few years, almost 45 years, but we don't state it on this slide. We prefer to say more than 40, but more than 40 is more than 20 and more than 30.</p>
          <p>Improving visibility for production growth. Also all those projects, just to say that in 2011 we have had seven startups, including the Ofon 2 in Nigeria and an additional five to come. Those are the projects which are bringing the growth of our production. They are there, they exist, they are not at stake, even if it's always a challenge, it's a challenge well managed by the E&amp;P teams, so we are quite proud of what has been done by Total in 2011, and which we continue in 2012.</p>
          <p>Exploration strategy, I'd like to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:04). We have three major discoveries I was mentioning at the beginning, Azerbaijan with Absheron. I understand that the test is on the way. If you want to ask a question to Louis, he will be delighted to answer. He's not always delighted, on that one he is, so it means good news. French Guyana and Bolivia are the other wells we have on which we've made discoveries. But it means at the same time not only more wells, but new acreages, more aggressive ones, just like the one we've done recently in Ivory Coast or in Angola. I'd like to say as a joke at this point and I'll repeat it because I like to repeat jokes, we are maybe not in Brazil, but we are in Brazil in Angola hopefully.</p>
          <p>An ambitious exploration program for 2012, 2013 that the numbers of wells, to give you the exact figures, we were at 48 wells in 2011. We moved to 65 in 2012 and 2013, which means that we've a strong portfolio of assets but also a strong wish to make the discoveries on those assets. I'll not say what are all of those, but definitely it's a mix of conventional and frontier, but always targeting what we call elephants and big cats. Definitely for doing this we needed to increase our exploration program, our exploration investment program, by 20%, which means $2.5 billion by and for 2012.</p>
          <p>Strong production growth by 2015. So we maintain, of course, our commitment of 2.5% increase as an average for &#x2013; so to make everyone again happy with this, because we have always the debate of 2010 or 2011, when we talk about 2.5%, it's starting at the end of 2010 or the beginning of 2011, which is the same, until 2015. And on this period an average of 2.5% growth, which means by 2015 an additional 600,000 barrels per day and of which 95% is producing or under development, which means committed, and that's important.</p>
          <p>When we're asked always are you committing yourself? Yes, we are, because it is there. So, the contribution of the startup to the cash flow and to production, so you have on the left part the 600,000 barrel per day I just mentioned. You have then the operating cash flow of these start-ups during the period at $100 per barrel. Today we are at $119. $10 billion in 2015 and the startup in terms of cash flow per barrel bringing $50 per barrel equivalent in 2015. So we don't only deliver production, we deliver production which are profitable and, of course, profitable meaning cash.</p>
          <p>LNG to value creation, just keep in mind that are we the second larger LNG player or the first, I don't think we are the first, but are we the second or the third, doesn't mean anything. We are well positioned to increase the value of our portfolio of assets and definitely on the top to value the trading of those assets and to trade the LNG contracts that we have in our portfolio. Philippe, I already mentioned his name, Philippe Boisseau is not an executive member, but he's in charge of something else, of our LNG trading. And I can tell you he is delivering net operating income. So be it through trading or through our Upstream portfolio, we consider definitely that LNG even being extremely capitalistic is bringing more cash to the company than the average portfolio.</p>
          <p>Three LNG projects, just to say that it's good to use what we have, it's even better when you have other projects in mind. So Ichthys has been launched, Angola will deliver soon. Gladstone has been launched but is not yet delivering. So that's underway and we have other ideas in mind to continue to develop our activities in a part of our business which we consider as one the most important and relevant parts of the Total portfolio.</p>
          <p>Total means rather important investment, so we don't escape the subject, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:39) such a debate on Ichthys. Ichthys is under normal, I would say, costs per barrel. It's heavy, but it's what it is. It's profitable, so we tried to make it clear in this presentation to say that it represent $1,500 per ton, which is an average of the one of our competitors. Now what's important at the end is not only the size of investment, it's the return on investment, and the return on investment for this project is definitely above the average of our startups.</p>
          <p>Industry leader in deep offshore. Well, you know this, but it's worth mentioning it. And it's the position of management that if only 10% of our production and is 20% of our results. So yes, some people are saying it's risky, but definitely we don't consider it as risky and it's risk and reward and it's proved here with a lot of new project to come on stream or to start in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Upstream investments. To have cash flow you need to invest. So here you have the organic investment, so it's increasing from $17 billion to $20 billion. It's mostly coming from startups and producing assets and, of course, that's normal. Post-2017 because we are preparing the future, so we will not mention more than what it is. What's important for you to remember is what we've always said is strict financial definition of the environment we use for launching those projects. Short-term plateau, $80 per barrel, long-term plateau, $100 per barrel, $120, so when it's more than $100 and even more than $80, it's more than what we are telling you in terms of what our view is on the future.</p>
          <p>Downstream is moving quickly. So, as you know, we've been restructuring our Downstream. I must say it has been quicker than expected, even if I told you that the target date was the 1 of January 2012, I said it was also a way to make it. Now it's true that we not only said it, we made it. We made it in terms of structure and now we have to deliver. So, you are have, two person responsible of now proving that what we decided was right.</p>
          <p>And if you asked them, they will tell you, but I mean just on the side of this, it was needed. I definitely think that doing this we are just one step ahead of our competitors. They are now asking how have you been doing it, why, et cetera. It seems common sense. It had to be done, it's under way and definitely I do strongly believe that this new organization will bring a lot of cash and, more than this, competitiveness of our assets in what we call mature areas like Europe. Yes, you can make money in Europe, but you need to change and to be more definitively counting on synergies and cost cutting.</p>
          <p>On the commercial part, we considered it was better to have marketing on this slide and not any more Refining. There is less and less link between refining and marketing. There is more and more good reason to consider that marketing is not a real option for growth, it's also an option for acceptability, it's also an option for getting access to new reserves. And if they are examples we can be clear even more it's one of those. But definitely what we want to do is to make it profitable as such and not only as being, by definition, acceptable.</p>
          <p>So, just a message on the notion of integrated platforms. As we say that synergies are not words, synergies are coming from facts and industrial moves, which means that we had often platforms where Chemicals and Refining were just next to each other but not delivering synergies because they were not in the same division. So, it's good to talk about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:20), I know it's one of the short ones, but just believe it. That is why we were serious in saying it's not just by words by fact that this new platforms will deliver their profitability which is there. Let me see...</p>
          <p>So our commitment &#x2013; sorry the commitment of Philippe and Patrick with the support of Executive Committee and the Board of Directors is to bring a 5% increase in profitability in the four years to come, which is to say a 5% increase, we make it as a split between the, let's say, major platforms, which is a 1.5%, worth mentioning. Portfolio changes, that's already almost done, which is still part of our portfolio, which was having a lower profitability than the existing one. So when you sell CEPSA, you don't only get cash, you also increase your rate of return. And more than enhancing, which is important part, these efficiencies and synergies 2% with the 2010 environment, it should bring us to 14% return. That definitely for the mix of Refining, Chemicals and Marketing, which does not exist anymore but we have to compare things with things, it will be shared between the two divisions of the company.</p>
          <p>Outlook. Well, first one word on CSR, it doesn't mean that it's not an important part of our strategy. Our view is that &#x2013; somebody told me don't talk about it. I said, yes, we need to talk about it, but just to say one simple word, it's part of our strategy. It's not only a strategy, it's a priority, and more and more important where we operate without CSR, there's no chance we can develop our business. So we'll not enter into details, ask if you want, but definitely it's integrated in our strategy and it's integrated our decision of launching projects.</p>
          <p>Budget and commitment. Here you have the $22 billion of 2011, you have our commitment for the average three years to come, which was $23 billion, but I will certainly come back on it. But you have here the budget for 2012, it's $20 billion net investment. I know you like to have the organic budget, so the organic budget is $24 billion, with divestment of $4 billion, which should bring it back to $20 billion. And with $20 billion in 2012, it will help to have the average of $23 billion for the three years to come. Definitely, 80% is basically to Upstream, and out of the $4 billion asset of divestment, we already have $2 billion &#x2013; oh, no, more, because that's in dollars. It's not exactly 3, it's &#x20AC;2 billion, so then use the currency rate you want for billion dollars, but already you have out of the $4 billion, $2 billion coming from the side of Sanofi, so I do believe that in fact at the end of the day, we're probably selling more than $4 billion of assets.</p>
          <p>Ample free cash flow to fund growing investment and dividend. So you have on the right part, our commitment of keeping the average net investment for 2012, 2014, which are the three years I was mentioning, $23 billion average. You have $20 billion for 2012. We have a robust cash flow and you should just see the dividend of 2011, or paid 2011, which is $7 billion, you will see that our cash is definitely above $30 billion at $100. It's still at almost $30 billion at $80, which I don't expect it to be what we will see. So it's plenty of room, low risk to just make the financial capabilities and the financial strength of our balance sheet at stake. And Patrick is there to keep this under control.</p>
          <p>So strong balance sheet and return to shareholder, I've just mention it. And in just taking the adjusted net income and dividend, we have the same ratio. Well, we keep this 50% payout average target for our dividend to help you to make your calculation. In 2010 it was 50%, 2009, 66%. It's here. Probably doesn't matter because I know the figures by heart. Yes, it is here, but they are the same, which is good. And the 45%, if the Annual Shareholders' Meeting is accepting the dividend, which has been yesterday approved by the Board of Directions, is to maintain the dividend of $2.28, I know the figure by heart, but that's the challenge we have with Patrick. So that's 45% of payout, which is a competitive return, at least for the time being, because with the today's rate is the yield is almost at what 5.5 with the share value of today, which is close to &#x20AC;41.</p>
          <p>So to end my presentation before the Q&amp;A session, while implementing the new dynamic, not the new Total, but the new dynamism for creating value for 2012 and beyond, but not beyond petroleum, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:15) but the first priority to safety and acceptability, which is the same with responsibly. We need definitely to be more aggressive, bold, on our exploration which we have been. Production growth is important, 2.5. And now we strongly believe it's not only words but it's almost committed, which I mean delivered. Increased cash flow for our start-ups, which is again the commitment of the company, making the downstream after restructuration profitable and the strong management of our portfolio. And to make it in short-term, words or short words which is more the truth, first we are back to growth and profitable growth, increasing cash flow, which is today a strong concern of our investors.</p>
          <p>We really need to be careful, to have cash flow you need to invest. No investment, no cash flow. I like to read certain papers saying that it's good to have cash flow, don't invest. Believe me, I know what it is and we don't last long. Ability to invest, what's important is definitely being able to spend the money when we consider it's worth doing it on a profitable way and a long-term view. And last but not the least, focusing on unlocking value before making a strong investment; it's better to deliver the value from what you already in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So in my opinion, but that's my opinion, but that's to be yours, a good year in 2011, proving that we are meeting our commitments. We're ready to do more than this, deliver all of the growth which is needed for this company to come back to the normal price of our share. That was part of my speech at the beginning, but it's also an important message for those who consider still that the value per share of Total is not the right one. Believe me, I strongly share this.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I'll go to the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:05) On the cash flow numbers, you gave <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:15) as an average. Given the ramp up of your production, anyway you'll give us what you think the 2014 exit rate might be within that target for the cash flow? And then given where the oil prices are and that after using cash for CapEx and dividends, what would be your use for any additional cash flow you might have, whether it's an investment, the higher oil price, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:40)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:50). Now, I can answer Refining and Chemicals, you want to answer on this question? Okay. I will not answer to all of the figures in detail, we can answer on the one-to-one if it's a bit too long. Definitely, when you look at our portfolio, and I've been telling you what it is with the numbers we have today, the cash flow coming from the new operations is definitely higher than what we have today as an average.</p>
          <p>Now, I know the subject and I know because we've been discussing it many times. I know that the decline of our assets is definitely based on assets which usually have high return and high cash flows. And when we told you replace in fact that again lower cash flow, sorry, high cash flow by lower cash flow, it's obvious that it's true. Because I mean, when we had those assets, they were built at the time where the price of oil was lower, the cost was lower, so we had at the end extra high return.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the point of making new investment, which are today with lower returns than the ones we are replacing. First, what is important is we are more than the average of the existing portfolio and, second, as far as we believe that is important to have a vision on prices. To launch a project we use the 80-100, but if you ask me what you believe for the year to come just as it has been the case in 2011. And even if it's not only for &#x2013; I'm not being brilliant but I remember I told you when I was challenged by most of you to say it will be below 100, but it's 110. Good news, bad news? I don't know what it is, but I strongly believe in the long run it will be high and the problem will be just the problem of the tax and the share between states and companies.</p>
          <p>So definitely we believe that in the new operations, even today they are delivering what we consider as the normal double-digit rate of return depending of short-term plateau, long-term plateau. We definitely believe that on the side of the three years to come, the next to come after 2015 will be even more rewarding. Why? Because it has been our policy and the policy of many of our competitors is to move now only to project with high return. I mean high return where the price of oil is increasing. So no <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:48) at any cost, no fixed margin at any price, but just trying make it. I know this doesn't totally answer your question, but I mean I promise you we will answer to this in detail when we meet with Barclays and some others. But that's my way to answer in a global way then we can enter into to more details in terms of our figures.</p>

          <p>Hi, Christophe. It's Iain Reid from Jefferies. I have three quick questions. I think you or somebody in Total said a month or so ago you guys expect to see your current fiscal terms in French Guyana when you actually start developing Zaedyus. Can you tell us where you think you're going to move to on that basis? And secondly, <mark type="inaudible" /> (50:37) still waiting on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:44). Have you got any thoughts as to when we'll start to see that one? I know it's a moving target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer on the second one. Who wants to answer on the first one? I want to have my executive members.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understand the question was what kind of fiscal framework do we anticipate for Guyana discovery. Well, I will not answer precisely on this question because it's difficult to give any idea to anyone. So that it's true that today the government take on Guyana is not particularly low, but it's not particularly high. So I still hope that we will end up with the fiscal framework which will allow us to develop this discovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely at the end of the day, I mean, the good thing and the bad thing was globalization. I mean, I think everybody knows what is the normal split between states and companies, so I don't think it will be strongly different from others. And if I have to say something, unfortunately, I don't think it will be United States in context of corporate tax. Okay, income tax, too, by the way. But that's a private thing.</p>
          <p>As Shtokman is concerned, being the director of the company, I would have liked to leave. Particularly the first one, but &#x2013; well let's say that we are definitely more confident on Shtokman than we were at the end of the year. We got the approval to get an extension of the license. What I mean by the license is the right to participate through the license, which you know we have not the license holder, that has been done at the border between Christmas and the New Year. So, nice way to spend your holidays, and at the same time, it was good news. It proved that the Russians are more than ever extremely willing to get this gas. Will it be &#x2013; and I'm opening the subject broadly, will it be still a mix of LNG and gas pipe? We don't know.</p>
          <p>There is a chance it will move to gas and that the energy part will be shifting differently. Now, I mean, I cannot say more, but just to tell you that we have good ways of making this project, as all of our project in Russia, profitable. In any case, I mean, I cannot change what I've been saying, if it's not, we will not accept to participate through any FID. But I believe that the FID will be taken. Might not be exactly in the way it was structured at the beginning. Is it a clear answer?</p>

          <p>Hi. Theepan Jothilingam, Nomura International. Just one question actually. I was just looking at the portfolio and the targets around sort of a net investment at $23 billion. It seems this year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:47) But I'm just wondering sort of going forward, I mean, it sounds like from your comments that the risk of that $23 billion number on a net basis is perhaps is a little bit higher, but that's where it should come out. I was wondering what your thoughts are there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you want to have the list of the divestment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, necessarily. But I'm just wondering it sounds like the message is that Total will be a bit more aggressive on portfolio rationalization, but then you've given a number of $20 billion this year, but then there's $23 billion going forward, so it's a little bit more, so I'm just wondering whether there's actually a sense, is there a risk that number can come down and that's why you can see, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, we talked about the $23 billion before the $20 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's actually important. I give you the $23 billion last year before I give you the budget because we have this way of doing things in Total. We don't give a budget until it's being voted by the board. It has been voted at $20 billion net, in fact, at $24 billion minus $4 billion. That's what it is, so they are facts and it will be delivered. So it's lower than $23 billion. It's good you mention it. Which mean that through the that, it delivers with a certain capacity for growing our net investment.</p>
          <p>Now, are we going to deliver the net? Yes, we are. And that's why we use this presentation. I was upset, I said this to my friend of the company who said that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:23) couldn't deliver. It's slide number eight on the percentage of our sales of assets for the period 2010, 2011, when you have been told you don't know how to sell, you never sell, you only buy. Well, we are the one which is being the first buyer? No, the first seller of the industry, more than even BP and without Macondo. So how much can we do to prove that we are doing things when we said?</p>
          <p>And I would not go to the point of saying that today the investment net is $23 billion, if I give you the divestment, you will get the organic. In fact, if you try to get the budget, which are a key for my board, you will not get it. And I am absolutely confident. And during the one-to-one we will tell you which assets could be for sale and ready for sale. And independently of the $23 billion, as we said, it's a new management of our assets who will make it.</p>
          <p>Now I mean, if you consider that you don't believe, I mean, you don't believe. I cannot force you. But we proved it, we will continue. We have a list of assets to be sold and when we said $23 billion, it will be $23 billion. At the same time, with $23 billion, do we get and keep a strong balance sheet? The answer is yes. You will bring sufficient cash flow to pay dividend and even increase dividend? The answer is yes. So now the question is do you want a list of everything we'll be doing in the three years to come? The answer is no.</p>

          <p>Okay. Can I try something else, just on Angola? Perhaps I think it shows on one of the slides you're <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:10) maybe if you can give a little bit color on maybe what block or relative to some of the news that's come out, I think that'll be great.</p>

          <p>John Rigby from UBS. Two questions, one is you've obviously just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:48) Utica transaction. So that's finally an entry into the U.S. after many years. Is that a prelude to something bigger, in that now you're in there, you may as well get larger? It's a big place and you've got a small position. Are you getting more comfortable with operating the U.S. and does that mean that you'd be able to do more transactions either onshore or offshore?</p>
          <p>And second is just going back to the financial framework that Theepan was talking about. When you look at your net number over the next few years, are you clear already what you think the pluses and minuses are or do you have a sort of list of &#x2013; a longer list of potential disposals which will be dictated by what your organic spend is likely to be over the next two to three years? And if something organic, inorganic comes up, what would you feel previous position, would you likely let your debt rise or would you go back to that list and look to sell something else to sort of offset that additional investment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd talk about the second one because it's linked to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:02) it's against WTO rules. I'm joking. But we have the first list and the second list. First list is the one which is part of our project and plans, and the second list is the one which is to be used in case we really need it. But normally the first list should be not only good for maintaining the cash rate, it should be, but also good in terms of asset management.</p>
          <p>I'm repeating that we've changed our strategy. We're not anymore selling for meeting cash flows or gearing even, we want to maintain our gearing, but we are confident in our gearing. So the second list, as you said, would be to be used if we are wrong in our estimates in terms of price and things like this. But today, frankly, we've think that with the first list we will manage easily and maybe especially the price of oil and gas outside of the United States remain at those levels, which are above the prices we are using in our presentations as it is today, I mean <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:12) today is at $11. Okay, the weather is cold, but okay it's cold, so it was warm, now it's cold. But it is at $11.</p>
          <p>So, again, we don't see any reason for the time being to go to the list number two, but it exists. And this list is just to be used in case we will be facing a problem which, frankly, we don't see today. But to also at the same time answer to the question of Japan. We are proud of having investments. I mean, I don't want to always say that, okay, we are concerned about investment. I mean, we are concerned about organic investment and the only thing we want to do is to reduce our investment. It's not true. We want to have a strong investment base of good assets. And maybe that's not exactly what you want to hear.</p>
          <p>You would like to hear that we will increase our cash in selling assets when we believe in higher price of oil and gas. I disagree with this. The strategy of Total is to invest in profitable projects, with cash and return for the company, more even cash flow in the future. We have ups and downs, sometimes we invest more and then we have cash low, whereas a company like a Shell, which has been investing billions of dollars, which is now getting cash. But if you are not investing, then you will not have cash today.</p>
          <p>When they have been investing everybody was shouting, crying. Now they have cash, everybody is saying, bravo. If you don't invest, you don't have cash. If you don't follow your strategy on a long-term basis, you die. What's important is to have strong criteria for developing new assets, a strong criteria in terms of balance sheet, keeping your gearing and making it in a way where you give a priority to your shareholders. So when you ask me the question, where the priority? The priority is definitely not to sell assets. It's to sell when it's needed or when it's worth doing it, which means not any more profitable assets, which I mean, assets with no upside.</p>
          <p>And we could be very well one year selling more because we have opportunities to sell, because we don't consider an asset is good, which means that we will have a gearing below 20%, which is not our target, but why not? And then we might have to go to 25% But, I mean I would like to have our investors to understand that it's not to keep 20% fixed on a year-by-year basis which is a good way to manage a company.</p>
          <p>The company needs a certain flexibility based on trust. It's difficult not to make it as 20%, 21% and 21% and 20.5%, and today we have all the capacities to, at the same time face our commitments and also face our wish, especially in this world where there is a need for new assets, there is a need for new productions. I mean, why should we get out of that? So we will take and continue to invest on a sound basis and definitely not at the expense of our shareholders, because they have the priority for the money they're bringing to the company.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you, because I like to open the subject easily, we are talking on purpose of working capital. I knew the word, but I was trying to bring Patrick into the discussion. Well, we've had the numbers of working capital at the end of the year which was far higher than expected. It's very difficult to predict the working capital on one day. That's a balance sheet, it's one day. And we know at the end of the year, especially when the prices of oil are high, I mean, you have a lot of income to be paid, it's showing our working capital plus or minus and it can change the figures very quickly.</p>
          <p>I mean, when Patrick gave me, his team, not him, and what I call expectation on what could be the working capital, what we had at the end was different. Company is not richer or less rich, it's what it is. So it's more about gearing from 22% to 23%, okay. I would have preferred 22%, but it is a same company with the same balance sheet, with the same strengths but it's moving with those kind of things. So, again, what is important is to give you our targets for gearing we said 20% to 30%, in fact, we're much more in the 20% to 25%, and definitely in the recent years much close to 20% on purpose. That is to give our investors the credibility of the way the Total strategy is moving, respecting our balance sheet, respecting the dividend.</p>
          <p>And then we will have to sell assets. Normally, we will have the wish to sell assets. When we sold CEPSA, it was not because we were forced to sell CEPSA. We sold it because we sold it was good for reducing our exposure on refining and even marketing for that one in Europe, and it has been done. It was good for the strategy of relationship with Abu Dhabi. And at the end of the day it was part of our commitment to reduce the refining capacities to 500,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>When we sold CEPSA, again, I'm not criticizing, I'm listening to you. But nobody is taking into account the fact that we've reduced our refining capacity by 256,000 barrels a day. But as far as it was part of the 500,000, that does not exist anymore. So, we should have set 756,000. I said, why? We set 500,000. So, if it's coming from CEPSA and not coming from something else, that's what it is. That's management. And what is important is when we said 500,000, we did more. Should we do more? Yes. Do we think we still have to adapt our refining capacities in Europe? Yes, it will be done on the right time. We've done it on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:00) we're not the only one moving, it helps.</p>
          <p>Remember the discussion we've had two years ago in this room about who should be the first to sell <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:10). Now, I mean, we are at the moment. But we're fit to manage it. So that the way our company is managed and I strongly believe that with Louis and his team we proved that we're now a good sellers, that we have assets to be sold. But it's been definitely &#x2013; I know that you like to know the list but I cannot say. Now, you know our portfolio, you know which assets are long-term or short-term, it's easy to understand what it could be. But I cannot go further on or be more explicit.</p>

          <p>Sorry. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:57) There is a debate and I was listening to the Exxon, what's it called? On the Exxon <mark type="indiscernible" /> (70:13) Meeting and good questions you asked the CFO, because I mean the CEO was not present. He's keeping himself for the next one. So I've heard that they were extremely confident in the gas price in the medium and long-term, but for the time being, they are focusing on developing part of the assets which are liquids-rich.</p>
          <p>Well, I mean, you heard the answer for Utica and Total, maybe a little bit more conservative view on the price of gas than our colleagues. But in terms of assets going to Utica, which is rich in liquid reserves, it was worth doing it because at the same time we are profitable with a very low price of gas, thanks to liquids. And, second, if this company I was just mentioning is right on the price of dry gas or the dry gas part of liquids will make this project tremendous. But it's a good way to have access to reserves in the States at a good price.</p>
          <p>Does it mean that we will go further than this? This time, the answer is no, for one simple reason. First, we have large now base of gas in the U.S., especially in shale gas. We have the part in the south which is not as rich, so which needs to be driven a different way. And you heard that Chesapeake was extremely careful in sometimes reducing the numbers of wells they are drilling. On Utica, we are much more in an easier positioning.</p>
          <p>But for the time being, this one, we've said that it was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:50) because it was rich in liquids. So it's a project which is, in fact, thinking that on the short or medium term, oil price will be high, and in the longer-term, as far as you have huge reserves base, it's still important to have gas dry, or dry after the liquids are taken out in the United States. That doesn't mean that we are going to develop something larger, it doesn't mean that we will be buying a company, even if, who knows, but I mean there is no such plan today in our vision.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Eileen <mark type="indiscernible" /> (72:35). I had two Upstream questions. So first Argentina. I <mark type="indiscernible" /> (72:45) of unconventionals. You are in the country. What is your view on the economics of this project, particularly in a very uncertain political environment currently? And my second question on Azerbaijan where you have a lot of conventional gas, can you talk a little bit about how we turn that &#x2013; we avoid turning that into stranded gas, i.e., what pipeline routes and when? It seems to me we've been talking about some of these pipelines for as long as we've been talking about Shtokman. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question was about Argentina, yeah. We consider that there is a high potential for shale gas in Argentina. That's why we took more permit with this objective. It happened, as probably you know, that the permit that we have had for a long-time are also perspective for shale gas, so when you combine our existing permits with our perspective for shale gas which, I mean, at least the ones which are American, and the permits that we acquired quite recently, all together we consider we have a nice acreage in terms of shale gas. And in 2012, we have a number of ways to work this acreage.</p>
          <p>Regarding the new, very recent move of the authorities, for the time being, it does not apply to gas flows, to maintain what we call the gas flows, plus which is the incentive for gas, but what they removed is the incentive that they had put in place for oil. But as far as we are concerned as a company, we are not in a situation to take advantage of the oil plus incentives, but we took advantage of the gas flows, and for the time being it has not been changed, and they say that it will not be changed.</p>
          <p>So, that's all what I can say. The second question was about Azerbaijan, do I take it? Regarding the pipe situation, before up-sharing, we have already the issue of the Phase 2 of Shah Deniz and what I can say is that this issue is progressing quite well, and I am quite confident that there will be a solution, a pipe solution, to unlock the delivery of gas and that to avoid to have the gas turned and I believe that before Absheron comes into production. Today, I don't think it is on a critical path of our development of Absheron.</p>

I must say that I look forward to comment a little bit on &#x2013; it's not going to start producing in three years' time. So, its purpose was much more we need gas to prove that we can play a role. So, today, the question is much more modest either to continue to know exactly what is a discovery which seems to be very attractive to make the necessary delineation, and then to develop the field. But in terms of access to markets, I don't think there is any reason to be concerned, so it's already unlocked. Now the problem is we need to deliver, and I can say that we will get much more, I would say, pressure to deliver the gas than to wait and see. Now it's also politics.</p>

          <p>Hello, it's Martijn Rats from Morgan Stanley. I have a question about your new project pipeline. The nature of question is this, ever since you communicated this target of $32 billion or $33 billion of cash flow from operations over the next three years, I must admit,, we've been struggling with everything else you've told us to kind of fully explain that. And listening to the presentation today, it sounds like a possible explanation of the gap between of what we thought we could get to versus that number is a very high cash flow coming from the new projects that you're starting up.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 21, it looks like the project you're starting up between 2011 and 2015 are generating roughly double the cash flow per barrel compared to the existing portfolio. That point is dramatically higher. If I then look at slide 16, which shows the projects backing up that increased gas flow, it does looks like it's fairly typical list of oil projects, I'm sure you're going to tell me they're fantastic projects but those are fantastic projects in your current portfolio.</p>
          <p>What is it in these projects that will allow Total to generate double the cash flow per barrel, whilst the general trend of the industry over the last number of years has been to develop the easy oil first and, therefore, profitability has been on a like-for-like based on the downward strength? What's so special about this list of projects that is going to &#x2013; that it will allow you could generate double the cash flow per barrel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What can I say, that I checked the number, which is true? It was checked by the CFO, because that's all <mark type="indiscernible" /> (78:33) presentations. So, I can give you the list for the projects with the dates, and then you'll have to make your own calculation. But the result is coming from the cash flows of each of those projects which are in our startup dates. Now, you can question the startups in terms of dates, you can question the investment cost. I think we are usually quite conservative, but here, I have a list of all the projects and I'm sure that the financial team will be more than happy to give you those fields and production in details and then the result is made from the computation of the E&amp;P.</p>
          <p>So I cannot say you more that it is a result of all of those startups and then you can challenge it one by one. So as far as I cannot do it myself, it's not true, to give the kind of hot potato to somebody else, but I deeply consider that those have been done in the right way. So, we will definitely answer to your questions, I mean, at the appropriate time. So, I cannot give you the list today, but I mean, I'm sure that we're ready to answer on the way we achieve this number.</p>
          <p>I'm sorry, but, I mean, unless I answer to each of the fields, I cannot tell you why and especially in the list, it's true that you have fields with I would say high cash and some with less. And especially in terms of timing, in terms of plateau and in terms of cost. Now, it's a mix of everything. You have North Sea, we often forget North Sea, that's why you need <mark type="indiscernible" /> (80:20) North Sea still exists. Even the U.K., given we don't like the new tax regime. So it's very difficult to say that it's going to be a lot of cash at the time we are telling the government that it's not true, but it's still not so bad in comparison. But it's less than what it should be. I mean, I cannot be more normal than this, but it's what it is.</p>
          <p>So, you have the North Sea, you have Nigeria, you have Norway, that's the North Sea, too. You have Ichthys, which is a good project. You have part of Argentina, Italy, Congo, that's all of those who are making it this figure. So unless you answer in details, I tell you more than those figures that's correct, and ready to be challenged.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter Hutton from RBC. Three fairly definitional questions really. Can I ask in the Downstream, by how much should we expect the capital employed to decline between 2010 and 2015 to help to the rate of return?</p>
          <p>Second question is and this may be perhaps related to Martin's question a little bit. Can you give an indication as to what the average operating rate of Pazflor was in the fourth quarter and what it was operating at the end? Because, obviously, we see that there was certainly one of the projects which is helping on the road.</p>
          <p>And the third one is, you mentioned what the organic reserve replacement rate was, but I'm afraid I missed it. Could you confirm that? And if there's any differences between the oil and the gas side on the organic side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the first one, so we do not expect to have the capital employed decrease. Part of the profit or the value we want to deliver is coming from new projects. So we're investing in Dubai, we're investing in other projects like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (83:48). So these attract capital and in fact we are more in our plans as it probably increase. In fact we need to decrease in Europe but to increase in other projects which are more profitable, which is part of the 1.5% you have seen of gain in the schematics we have given to you.</p>
          <p>So the strategy today is on controlling the capital employed in Europe, and improving the profitability of European activities, which are quite low today. So, it's part of the efficiencies and synergies are directly related to Europe. And then we have other projects which are much more profitable on the emerging countries, especially Korea, Qatar, and Dubai coming on stream.</p>
          <p>Now, we have been selling a large part of our, what we call Specialty Chemicals, which are not part of our long-term strategy. And we still have the portfolio of Specialty Chemicals, which are of good quality, which have been improving their returns largely, and as you have seen, when we say 10% return in chemicals in 2011, it's mostly coming from those Specialty Chemicals. So you have to be careful with what you might keep in mind of what was the return on those assets in the old days, which means only four years ago when they were very low return, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (85:25) more than the average return than the group, which means above 16%.</p>
          <p>So we never talk about those assets because, first, they are not huge assets. And, second, I mean they are probably not in our core business. So I don't want to be more explicit but I mean part of those assets, we can sell if needed. It's not only E&amp;P, it could be those. Again, careful we need to be because of certain flows, but at the end, we do it. Resins have been sold, but <mark type="indiscernible" /> (86:06) has been sold, so keep this mind <mark type="indiscernible" /> (86:14)</p>
          <p>But at the end, it's true that in terms of refining a chemical, we believe that outside of Europe which is too mature, close to raw, and what we will do is be more not only adapting ourselves, but to invest in places where we know and think there is a long term, otherwise we will not invest. But for those countries, like I don't like to talk any more about emerging countries because as I've said this morning now are emerged and it's time to recognize this. I mean, yes, we still believe that and for this we can go into more details, it's a product of the long-term and today we see it, as in lot of places, becoming short. So, today there is an economical crisis, but just to consider that you have to get rid of all petrochemicals activities, just to please I don't know who, that's not our strategy.</p>
          <p>So as Patrick said, we'll be very careful in the way we increase our capital employed in the Refining and Chemicals. It will be reduced in terms of percentage versus the rest of the group, but it's obvious, when we invest 80% in the Upstream <mark type="indiscernible" /> (87:30) 1912, but at the end, I mean, the Downstream part in relative terms will be lower. But lower doesn't mean we will use the capital employed, but again, we will follow the same rules for the rest of the group, if they are not economical, we'll not do anything, so it means we are going to be extremely strict on any decision on the specific part of our core business. Oh &#x2013; Pazflor?</p>

          <p>Regarding Pazflor, we are exactly on track with our plan and we reached <mark type="indiscernible" /> (88:15) to be precise. So, we have another 17,000 barrels per day to reach the total of 220,000 barrels per day. And we will be able to achieve it when we have some national <mark type="indiscernible" /> (88:40)</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (89:13) over the year. As you know, it is a proven reserve, so there is absolutely no impact of any exploration discoveries in that, but clearly of course, even for our acquisition, most of the acquisitions are acquisitions of things which are in the yearly path of the cycle and it's a deliberate strategy. We are not buying the production, we are not buying the proved reserve. So here, again, most of the year and entirety of what we have done in year 2011 in terms of preparation of the structural exploration of discoveries of these opportunities has, of course, no impact this year on the organic rate of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (90:17)</p>
          <p>At the same time, if we look at the decision the FID we took, which there are number of them and here, some decision have the full impact in terms of organic reserve replacement rate, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (90:35). But some of it, like gas to LNG, are nonconventional gas. And as you know that in nonconventional gas, you are not able to book in 1P a large package of reserves that you believe over the years when you are progressing with it already. So there is a slight moderation, I'm sure, coming from the impact coming from that. In terms of liquids and gas, I have not the precise...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer, I had time to read my notes, so it is just to help you, not to take care of the lead. But I think it's more interesting, by the way, to get split on resources <mark type="indiscernible" /> (91:24) as we will explain. Because, I mean, the 1P on a one-year basis of 1P, what we've been seeing for instance in 2011, it is playing an important role. It is officially more gas than oil but, economically, it's more oil than gas for two reasons. First, the liquid content is very high. And second, all the gas is sold on the crude reference. So at the end of the day, it's not a real gas project, even if we're producing gas.</p>
          <p>On the resources, the figure of 40 years resource life, on the slide you have the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (92:06) country, 35% long term plateau, 35% Canada, Australia, Russia 30%. But in terms of split between oil and gas, it's 55% oil and 45% gas, so it's roughly where we are today in terms of production. And when I'm asked what is your target, as I said to the board yesterday so I have the same answers for you and the board, I said 50%-50%. Why? Because I cannot say more than this. But today, it's true that definitely even on the long-term view, it's roughly 50%-50%, and on the resource base 45%-55%. Now, it will be more interesting for you to get into the details of what is gas linked with the U.S., what is gas linked with U.K, what is gas linked with the Far East? And that then has to be studied on a case-by-case basis, but roughly with 45%-55%, you are in the market. <mark type="inaudible" /> (93:20)</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. First off, one of the charts I liked last year was in September was the decrease in cost and timing overruns relative to budget that you were doing back in September from 2005 to 2010 and the decreasing trend. Could you just say whether that's still the case in 2011 or you do expect it to be the case or what sort of pressure you're seeing from your service contractors? I think it allows us to build confidence in the returns and in the organic growth potential of the company.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it's actually back to John's question about unconventional gas in North America. Your entry mechanism is always through the middleman through a Chesapeake, et cetera, whereas in Europe and South America, you seem to going through a private company or directly through a license. Why is it that you have to pay that more expensive entry price when you're looking at the U.S. unconventional bid, can you not go in almost below the radar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll lead on the first two questions, even if you have to follow what I said last time, but I think you know what it is in terms of contractors and inflation. Well, on the last one is this question if do we pay more or less is always fascinating because it always depends what you buy and how you make it. And we always very transparent in the way we are, I would say, announcing our contracts and our agreements. And it's true that when there is a carry, we say there is a carry and this carry is added to the cost of acquisition of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (95:15) and it's used by some of you as being the total amount and you divide by X or Z and you find a price, which is your price.</p>
          <p>I'm surprised when we've been ourselves making all comparison with all the other buyers <mark type="ph" /> PETRO (95:33) and others, well, I've seen that for our high-liquid content project, Utica is one of the cheapest acquisition. So I mean it would be interesting to compare our views. But, I mean I can tell you we don't think that Utica has been done on the high price level. Now, is it true that Chesapeake when they acquired the surface in the year, I don't know when, we're happy to do it and clever. And it's true that Total is not an expert in buying farms and land and our expertise is much more in producing. But when do you look at everybody being in the industry like us, nobody has been in the land business. We all have been acquiring, most of us, we've been acquiring assets from those smaller companies, but which at the same time, cannot develop their assets without us. So it's a good win-win. I don't know what is the price in terms of per barrel cost of acquisition really on Utica, but it's what? You have it?</p>

          <p>No, no, no. In terms of dollar per barrel because I don't care about the whatever by square meters, I don't understand this. I mean, I like to be in this business, but we're not. So in terms of &#x2013; $3? Okay. So I mean, $3. I mean, okay, is it good or bad? I don't know. I think it's a good acquisition and I think that all the others and to start with the biggest one, XTO. I think Utica is a far more interesting. Now it's my view, let's share it in making our comparison, but it's true that reading sometimes certain of your papers and ours, I have a difficulty to understand why we are so different.</p>
          <p>But when we pay the price we pay, first, then the carry for how long, there is a short-term limit. They have to do this, this, and that, otherwise, they don't get it, and have to take everything to account, while I deeply think that Utica is a good deal. Now, I mean, was it better three years ago? Yes, certainly, it is the reason not to do it today? Certainly not, or you never do anything when you lost it one day. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (98:10) global energy, okay, we could have done it at a far better price, but we didn't. It is then a good reason to say as far as we couldn't get it at that price, we will never acquire it. No. So, okay, sometimes we are late, sometimes we are newcomers. In Angola, we are coming among the first in those pre-sold, same in Ivory Coast, in Brazil better, in Argentina good. But the way company is driven, but on Utica I think we made a deal which is externally lucrative, thanks to this liquids content.</p>
          <p>Now, it's true that if you use $60 for liquids and it's a bad deal. So, it's all depends on what are your assumption on the price of oil because it's a very rich content, I mean, that rich. While it is true even if we have been at the time trying to think about it, we considered that our job is not to acquire land, because that's specific business. It's true that at the end you pay more, but, again, it's not our business and I don't see that a lot of big companies would find themselves in the good position in making these land acquisitions. The cost is to pay the price for somebody who has been doing an interesting job, but as far as we are not Marxists. We don't care that Chesapeake is doing a good deal as far as we're doing a good deal too. Otherwise, I mean if you say, okay, they are making too much money so we're not going to participate to the deal. Okay, that is Marxism. Last one?</p>
          <p>But, I mean, to answer it's important that I think the question has been heard by our team and let's check your figures between what we have and what you have. I think it's always interesting, especially to get your notes and I would myself I'll be interesting to get to yours so that I can understand why we have maybe a difference of opinion. So, it's interesting. Thank you.</p>
          <p>So, last one?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I'm Nitin Sharma, JPMorgan. When you think of reserve replacement, how important or how much emphasis do you place in organic reserve replacement, especially in light of the recent increase in your acceleration spend? And is there are target or an ambition that you've got for organic reserve replacement even an average, three-year average, five-year average basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Old question about organic versus nonorganic. Frankly, I think we have to move a little bit on that boring discussion because I am a little bit surprised to see so much pressure on organic. When it was organic only, you were saying where is the nonorganic? And then when we are buying assets, then they become reserves and that's why we buy them. So, it's good at the end they become reserves. So if they are coming from what they were, what counts is how much cash it will deliver, at what price we will acquire them. If it's coming from explorations, it is true that normally it's better. But I mean at the end, what is exploration? It's to get access to exploration blocks, you have to pay for it.</p>
          <p>So what means organic? It means anything you're doing by yourself. Well at the end, there is very little you're doing by yourself because usually you don't create organic reserves from existing fields except when you're good at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (101:50) and the North Sea, when you're capable from old fields to revise the fields and to find new 2Ps and 1Ps with new technology reversing. That is the real organic, is when you're capable from oil in place and gas in place to increase your reserves. That is organic.</p>
          <p>All the rest is not organic. Exploration is not organic. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (102:20) which means acquiring resources not only not developed, but not even 2P or 1P. It's not organic, but it's all based on the technology of Total. So at the end, what counts is what kind of 1P reserve do you have, how much cash that they will bring and how much capacity we have to bring additional reserves in our portfolio. But I mean this organic, non-organic, I will leave it to the finance division because, frankly, I don't see as the CEO of Total I am bringing more on, okay, I'm doing better in organics than in non-organic. I'm doing better when I deliver growth and profits. If it's coming from organic or not, I will leave it to the experts.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much confidence can you place on the strategy that is reliant on acquisitions in terms of growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In these days, because I am a young old man -they were not talking about organic and non-organic. We were talking about reserves. And Total was known as extremely good because of its capacity to make those good acquisitions of non-developed resources, by definition resources are not developed. And that was our expertise and then, of course, we are now doing the exploration. But I mean, what is important in a company is to prove that we can make acquisitions. I mean, Patrick was in charge of the new acquisition in E&amp;P and the result of this, he has been promoted. Well, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (104:15) because it's not the E&amp;P. But, frankly, that's the way it is. The capacity is now resource-based, and you say what is coming from organic and non-organic.</p>
          <p>And all of what we have in terms of resources are not all organic, but &#x2013; I'm sorry to be a little bit not following your point, I will leave it to others, it might be of interest. But, frankly, this new approach of organic, let's speak cash. I mean, we all want to talk about cash, let's talk about cash. But with organic and inorganic, I mean, I'm not sure that we're going to make money. But what's important is how much we believe that our resource base will become 1P and 2P. If it organic or not, if you would give me the definition of what is organic on your side, I might answer because, frankly, maybe I am what I am, but I don't understand the importance of what it means.</p>
          <p>Uganda is not organic. Is the new view we have on Argentina in the shale gas, is it organic? I don't know. When we acquired the blocks it was not for the unconventional, it was for the conventional. Now we find there is unconventional, is it organic, you believe? It's organic, you see. But I would say it's not. But again, I don't think it's important.</p>
          <p>How much do we believe that we would be able to continue to improve our replacement reserves? Very strongly. And do I think this is a one spot? No. As has been said by already Martin and his team, when you look at the all the acquisition we've made, which are whatever resources that we changed in 2P and 1P and that 1P developed. And that will be the real base for growth and cash of the company. But, again, to say that there is a magic number for a percentage of replacement in organic for 1P, I don't think we have a target, do we?</p>
          <p>But, again, yes we are very optimistic and to deliver additional 1P reserves in the years to come, but we'll do our best to explain then if it is coming from one side or another side.</p>

          <p>Okay, I am sorry but I think we have to stop there and have a chance have a drink. Thank you for joining us. Your questions are always of interest because I can't understand where you are expecting something new from Total or more investment. It's clear, cash, everybody is asking the same. I mean, do you consider that it's worth believing in high price of energy, because for me that's a very important point.</p>
          <p>Yes, we don't change our vision. We still believe that energy, especially hydrocarbons, will remain high and maybe higher. It doesn't mean that we'll be using more than 180 to launch our project, but we strongly believe that it will be becoming more and more difficult, not for us but generally speaking, to have access to reserves and that's why the price will remain high. So, if we are capable to maintain our costs low, if we are capable to definitely control the management of our projects and at the end putting the utmost priority on security and acceptability, yes, we will deliver the growth you expect from Total, and, yes, definitely even I know that I shouldn't end with this. Yes, I strongly believe that the share of Total is strongly undervalued.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
