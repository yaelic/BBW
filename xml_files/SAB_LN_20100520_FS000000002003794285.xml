          <p>Welcome to the SABMiller 2010 Results Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to SABMiller. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to SABMiller's results presentation for our F10 financial year ended 31st of March 2010. With me today as usual is Malcolm Wyman our CFO.</p>
          <p>First the formalities, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the current best judgment of the management, but include risks and uncertainties and the company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines. I'll get started.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased with the strong competitive performance of our businesses in markets where consumer spending has remained weak through most of the year. We remain concerned about the lingering effects of the economic downturn on consumers, particularly the delayed recovery in employment among key beer consumer groups. This is more of a problem in developed markets and in Europe in particular than in many emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Our ability to hold volumes flat in the downturn combined with our tight grip on revenues and costs has delivered underlying EBITA growth of 6%. And our adjusted EPS delivery was very strong, up 17% with the operating performance enhanced by lower finance costs and a reduced tax rate. Free cash flow was also well up at over $2 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>The strength of our leading local brands has stood us in good state. This has supported firm pricing with organic constant currency unit revenue growth of 4%. We've also been successful in building local premium brands, which sit at what I've described as the sweet spot of profitability with significant volume scale and higher unit margins. I'll return to this in a few moments.</p>
          <p>We've made further cost reductions across most of our businesses this year protecting profitability and in some cases funding increased marketplace investment. In most cases we're already the low cost industry leader and this reflects our drive for continuous cost improvement. Investment in growth opportunities has continued, most notably in Africa and Asia, to which I'll return shortly.</p>
          <p>Our efforts and the bottoming of consumer spending in some markets have resulted in firming volumes in the last quarter. But in general, spending and employment are lagging in these early stages of economic recovery. Our performance compares well to that of our global peer group, reflecting some market share gains as well as our better positioning in attractive beer markets. Our organic growth strategies are clearly working, optimizing local brand portfolios, routes to market and operations. Our commercial capabilities and growth initiatives are set to continue to deliver strong results over the medium term.</p>
          <p>I'll now walk you through some of our divisional highlights for the year. First in Latin America, economic conditions showed some signs of easing, particularly in the final quarter. We've succeeded amidst some challenging situations delivering lager volume growth of 3% for the region overall. In Peru, we've continued to beat the competition whilst improving the segment mix of the market.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, notwithstanding an excise increased which has been ruled unconstitutional, but which persists for now, volumes have grown recently, reflecting strong market execution by our people and easier comparables. And in Honduras amidst serious political turmoil, our team took action to safeguarded our supply chain and distribution and customer service and enabled commendable overall volume growth of 5%.</p>
          <p>We've continued to focus on upgrading the beer category, building our brands, further developing the portfolio and winning at the point of sale. By revitalizing and expanding our brand and pack portfolios, we've increased our share of alcohol in the majority of our markets.</p>
          <p>Our premium brands represented 9% of our F10 volume, almost double their share in fiscal '07. Firm pricing, positive mix and cost productivity delivered excellent EBITA growth of 17% and a big improvement in margins, despite the challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>As regards MillerCoors in the United States you'll have heard the teams' remarks on recent performance earlier this month. Trading conditions have remained difficult with high unemployment the key driver, particularly among demographic groups to which beer consumption is somewhat skewed. We hope to see some improvement in the top line later this year. However notwithstanding the subdued economy, pricing in the U.S. beer industry has remained firm.</p>
          <p>The integration processes going on deep within the JV are progressing well; in cost synergy realization as well as in market facing processes to create a more powerful competitive business. This work covers the JV's own systems, our interfaces with distributors, better channel execution tools, deeper local market opportunity assessments and finishing touches to the integration of the former Miller and Coors brand portfolios.</p>
          <p>All in all this work is starting to show in improved competitive performance within key market segments. MGD 64 and Blue Moon continue to do very well. And Coors Light, Keystone and Miller High Life have all gained segment share.</p>
          <p>And in the weak import market Peroni Nastro Azzurro continue to grow and this will be one of the center pieces in the JVs new import and craft business led by Tom Cardella.</p>
          <p>Europe has continued to be impacted by economic weakness, by high unemployment and tighter credit. The beer market is also impacted by increases in excise in many of our markets, necessitating large price increases to recover them. However, we are pleased with the competitive performance of our full brand portfolios in these circumstances.</p>
          <p>Our lead versus the main competition has widened considerably in Poland and Romania and we've held share in check despite our relatively premium position there amidst negative channel and segment mix trends in the market.</p>
          <p>In a market such as Italy, which is less about volume growth for its own sake, we made significant improvements in the value extracted via a more focused approach on key brands, channels and the amount of volumes sold on promotion. In the U.K., we are pleased with the continued strong growth of Peroni Nastro Azzurro in the on-premise and in national retailers.</p>
          <p>And in Russia, we grew our market share behind innovation on our premium brands. However, we retain a cautious outlook given the further regulatory proposals the government are considering which may restrict the location of beer sales and consumption.</p>
          <p>Africa delivered a robust performance across many of our markets on the back of investment in capacity and marketing. Organic lager growth of 6% was driven by the local premium portfolio, which grew 65% with nine new brands launched in the last 12 months. In particular, Mozambique returned to growth ending up 11%, reflecting improved availability and distribution in the North.</p>
          <p>Uganda delivered a strong performance through both underlying market expansion and continuing significant market share gain versus our regional competitor. Castel continued its run with volume growth of 12% across francophone Africa and Angola. Government taxation both helped and hindered us in Africa with Zambian volumes assisted by an excise reduction, while Botswana's lager volumes were severally impacted by a social levy on alcohol introduced in November 2008.</p>
          <p>Profitability in Africa was restrained in F10 by our upfront growth investments with a step function in new capacity, as well as temporary headwinds in Angola and movements in commodities and currencies across the continent. But overall momentum and top line growth is strong and we expect profitability to follow suit going forward.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our Chinese operations continue to enjoy a disproportionate share of market growth, with CRSB organic growth of 10%; over double the likely market rate of growth albeit with some market slowing more recently.</p>
          <p>Our national share now exceeds 20%. CR Snow's success in building high market shares and stronger profitability is now showing excellent results in the central region, notably in the Anhui and Zhejiang provinces where our share now exceeds 70% and 35% respectively.</p>
          <p>The development of the Snow brand including the recent launch of a portfolio of premium variants is key to our continuing growth in market share, and in unit revenues and profits. Margins continue to develop in a two steps forward, one step back manner as the organic improvement is offset by expansion which is dilutive in the short term. We saw this in the second half which was also affected by one-off events.</p>
          <p>Our Indian operations remain challenged by regulatory hurdles in several provinces and we are taking several steps to improve profitability in this difficult market context.</p>
          <p>Vietnam remains in the start-up phase domestically and has started an export operation, whilst in Australia, our Greenfield brewery is set to commence local production in June. We're very pleased with our progress in Australia with volumes up 32% and continued share gains for Peroni Nastro Azzurro.</p>
          <p>Our South African operations recorded pleasing progress on all five of the local strategic thrusts, which we highlighted last year, despite the fact that the economy went into recession for two quarters and competition intensified.</p>
          <p>Significant improvements in operational efficiency have enabled a large increase in market facing investments. These investments have centered on renovating the largest four brands in the portfolio and on servicing the most important classes of trade. The company stands well positioned to leverage its scale advantages and build on its brand strength in such a way that category growth is maintained within the new competitive landscape of South Africa.</p>
          <p>The launch of our black economic empowerment deal was widely recognized as innovative and genuinely broad-based and has provided a welcome boost to the government policy makers' vision for societal transformation. Also in South Africa, volume and competitive performance from our associate Distell was strong, led by rising sales of cider and ready-to-drink beverages.</p>
          <p>Turning now to progress on the group's four strategic priorities which we've pursued consistently over recent years to deliver value for shareholders. The first of these is creating a balanced and attractive spread of global businesses.</p>
          <p>GDP and population growth are two drivers of what we call the embedded growth of a market. This chart illustrates the proportion of SABMiller's and the peers' markets, which are expected to offer low, medium and high embedded growth prospects. It's clear that SABMiller is well positioned with the highest proportion of volume in high growth markets, indeed double the exposure of the second peer and considerably less presence in the low growth areas.</p>
          <p>And while this rising tide is helpful, it's not sufficient on its own. We'll continue to excel and differentiate ourselves by creating and driving the growth of the beer category with our skills and commercial capabilities.</p>
          <p>Nowhere is this now more evident than our rapidly growing African operations. In Africa, our footprint is already far larger than that of any of our peers. We're leveraging our commercial capabilities in the region and we're investing to build a beverage industry and sustain our growth.</p>
          <p>We've just this last month completed a two-year capacity expansion program adding 4 million hectoliters in capacity. This has held back profit growth in the short-term, but will in future improve our scale and profitability as we increase utilization of the new capacity.</p>
          <p>In Angola, Mozambique and Tanzania we're opening new sales territories to reduce transportation costs. In Nampula in Mozambique for example, our new brewery has allowed us to expand north of the Zambezi. Where the country is density populated, it has per capita lager consumption of less than two liters per capita per annum versus 35 liters in Maputo.</p>
          <p>We expanded capacity by 50% at our plant in Jinja in Uganda, allowing the team to meet rising demand in wider rural areas. And we are in the early days of expansion into Nigeria and Southern Sudan.</p>
          <p>In addition to expanding our lager footprint in Africa, we're accelerating our development of full beverage portfolios. Margins are initially diluted given the start-up investments and additional complexity. But ultimately, this provides operational and financial scale benefits in small and fragmented markets. For example, we acquired the Voltic Water business in Nigeria and Ghana, where it's enhancing our existing Ghanaian soft drink and beer business by combining the production facilities as well as a single route to market.</p>
          <p>We acquired Rwenzori, the leader in bottled water in Uganda. And we've made a significant new entry into Ethiopia acquiring Ambo, a venerable local water brand and entry port &#x2013; point into the broader beverage market.</p>
          <p>In Zambia, we acquired the maize based non-alcoholic Super Maheu brand range providing growth opportunities domestically and in other African markets.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our second strategic priority; developing strong relevant brand portfolios that win in their local marketplaces. Within this strategy our initiatives to develop local premium brands have proven to be very successful. In all our markets premium domestic brands represent a point of national pride, a badge of distinction and way to satisfy demand for affordable luxury. These brands are typically priced at 10 or 20% above the mainstream brands and represent a sweet spot of the beer profit pool combining as they do significant volume with higher margins.</p>
          <p>We're making consistent progress across regions with the relevant local premium brands from around the world shown here on this slide. Blue Moon and Leinens and Henry Weinhard's in the U.S., Club Colombia and Cusque&#xF1;a in Latin America. Lech, Pilsner Urquell and Kozel in Europe, Castle Lite in South Africa, a host of new and similarly positioned national premium brands across Africa. And in Asia the launch of premium Snow variants, which is enabling better revenue management. Prices often more than double the average in the beer market.</p>
          <p>As you can see here on this slide despite the economic pressure which inevitably results in some down trading, the success of these initiatives has been most visible in Latin America and in Africa.</p>
          <p>In Africa the launch of the line local premium brands has stimulated growth.</p>
          <p>The star has been Mozambique's Laurentina Preta, which is up 87% with other strong performances from Maluti, and Lesotho and Ndovu in Tanzania. Nile Gold in Uganda and Mosi Gold in Zambia are following suit. Castle also enjoyed strong growth in markets such as Zambia and Tanzania.</p>
          <p>In Latin America local premium brands have also been winners. They have grown at a CAGR of 18% in the last two years. This success has been based on specific consumption occasion insights, packaging innovation and expanded distribution with attractive merchandising. In the past year Cusque&#xF1;a grew 7% in Peru.</p>
          <p>Development of our international premium brands is underway in the region too. This is a longer term process linked to the development of a middle class and we're investing at an appropriate pace.</p>
          <p>Looking at our portfolio initiatives in Latin America more broadly, we're addressing different consumption occasions with five consistent product and package initiatives across the region. We're introducing smaller bottles in hot and humid areas following the success of Aguilita in Colombia. A smaller Pilsner pack was launched in January in Ecuador and by March this already represented over 8% of the total mix in the larger city Guayaquil.</p>
          <p>Lighter beers are also being launched and developed to increase consumption frequency. For example, we launched Aguila Light to target drinking at home with meals with an easier drinking formulation and lower alcohol content. It's now the third biggest brand in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Multi packs are being introduced in both on and off premise formats and we're rolling out alterative alcoholic beverage flavors to satisfy non-beer drinking consumers in bars, discos and other entertainment venues. And in non-alcoholic drinks, Pony Malta in Colombia and Ecuador, Malta Vigor in Panama and Maltin Power in Peru are proving successful.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our third strategic priority which is to raise the sustainable profitability of our local businesses. Results of our efforts in Latin America are clear with an EBITA CAGR of 16% and margins increasing by 320 basis points since the Bavaria acquisition.</p>
          <p>Our focus on both revenue and cost management has produced an attractive return on our initial announced investment of $7.8 billion, plus subsequent cumulative net CapEx. We've exceeded our cost of capital by the fourth full year post the acquisition, a year ahead of schedule. This is an impressive result particularly in light of the economic downturn and demonstrates the successful implementation of our strategies.</p>
          <p>And at MillerCoors the management have been able to attain significant synergies and savings since the formation of our JV in 2008. At the time of the JV formation, we aimed to achieve $500 million in synergies within three years and the JV has delivered nearly two-thirds of this so far. In addition we announced $200 million in additional savings for the JV from existing and new cost efficiency programs by the end of 2012 on top of the $50 million in pre-existing savings programs.</p>
          <p>The combined cost reduction this year has accounted for a total of 375 basis points in margin enhancement, which has kept us on track to deliver a return on capital in F11 in excess of our cost of capital in the U.S. as we forecast when we created the JV.</p>
          <p>The consolidation and expansion of our Chinese business continues with organic profitability growing firmly. This is diluted in the short-term by our Greenfield projects and incremental acquisitions; investments for a stronger platform in future.</p>
          <p>The Snow brand is now offered in six key variants, targeted at different occasions. Through disciplined management of these brands and pack variants in each class of trade, the long awaited premiumisation of beer category in the modernizing on and off-premise trade is starting to appear.</p>
          <p>CR Snow's ability to use its scale in these distribution channels and also the supply chain has resulted in improved revenue management and working capital optimization. This has enabled the continuing reinvestment to sustain market share growth and to extend scale advantages.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that in November we announced a number of interrelated strategic capability initiatives aimed at standardizing and simplifying the business, sustaining our competitive lead and commercial capabilities and cutting costs. The development and deployment of these systems is on track. Our global sourcing operation has been established in Switzerland. We will soon go live with a new back-office system in our South African operations and within our corporate office in the U.K.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the front-office system is now running in 37 of the 41 Peruvian distribution centers, which serve over 90,000 customers with the remaining scheduled for go-live in June of this year. We've outsourced the shared service center in South Africa and by the end of June 2010 we will have done this on three continents.</p>
          <p>Supply chain process and system enhancements are underway in South Africa and in Latin America as lead markets for the group. And working capital improvements are already in evidence with better controls and efficiencies generating $333 million in savings already this year.</p>
          <p>In conjunction with these far-reaching business capability program initiatives, we are continuing to develop the SABMiller organization. We're working to optimize regional manufacturing to improve cost efficiency. In general, we're focusing country management roles more intensely on our commercial functions, and to do so we're functionalizing or removing non-strategic administration from countries.</p>
          <p>And we are tailoring our commercial management approach by market type including our market structures themselves, our level of investment and our marketing support. Taken together, this continuing organizational evolution will both maximize efficiency and increase our local competitive focus.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand over to Malcolm to review our financial results for the year before I conclude. Malcolm?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. As in the past, my presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis, as this better reflects our underlying performance and profitability.</p>
          <p>The group has delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth in the year. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 17% whilst adjusted earnings per share growth of 26% was achieved in pounds sterling. Final dividend is US$0.51 per share which brings the annual dividend to $0.68 per share, an increase of 17% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>In a year characterized by difficult trading and economic conditions, we delivered another strong performance with lager volumes in line with the prior year on an organic basis. The resilience of most of our emerging markets particularly in the second half of the year offset volume declines across other markets, illustrating the strength of our global footprint.</p>
          <p>The strength of our local brand portfolios enabled continued share gains across many of our markets including China, Peru, Poland, Romania and Uganda. Soft drinks volumes across our Africa and Central America markets grew 2%.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency group revenue grew 4.2% for the full year up from the 3.1% growth reported at the half year. Revenue growth and tight cost management combined to raise EBITA over 6% on both a reported and an organic constant currency basis. Organic constant currency EBITA margin increased 20 basis points, somewhat lower than the increase reported at the half year.</p>
          <p>The group delivered double-digit earnings per share growth, leveraging a 6.5% year-on-year improvement in reported EBITA into a 17% growth in earnings per share in U.S. dollars. A lower effective tax rate reduced financing costs and lower profit attributable to minorities principally due to our purchase of the 28.1% interest in our Polish subsidiary Kompania Piwowarska all contributed to the strong earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Group revenue grew 4.2% on an organic constant currency basis with all regions delivering revenue per hectoliter growth. Strong pricing taken in the prior year coupled with some selected price increases taken in the second half of this year underpinned the strong group revenue performance. Revenue per hectoliter grew 4% in Latin America as a result of pricing and positive mix, with good growth in our premium brands.</p>
          <p>Despite down trading across many markets in Europe, revenue per hectoliter grew by 6%, reflecting pricing taken in the prior year and principally price increases taken in the Czech Republic and Russia in the second half of this year to recover part of the significant excise increases.</p>
          <p>In North America, MillerCoors grew revenue per hectoliter by 3% following price increases across all beer segments. In Asia, revenue per hectoliter grew by 2% with pricing gains in the first half offset by negative regional mix in the second half in China. And South Africa delivered good revenue per hectoliter growth of 7% following prior and current year price increases across our beer and soft drinks businesses.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the strong full year group revenue growth, second half net producer revenue was impacted by the cycling of strong price increases taken in the comparative period of previous year and the recovery of high excise increases in the last quarter of the current financial year.</p>
          <p>Despite lager volumes level with the prior year, we delivered a strong performance with organic constant currency EBITA growth of 6.3%, reflecting firm pricing, improved effectiveness of marketing spend and fixed cost containment, offset somewhat by an increase in cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>As expected, constant currency EBITA growth slowed in the second half affected by the cycling of strong price increases taken in the prior year and higher levels of marketing spend and fixed costs in certain markets.</p>
          <p>With some early signs of improved economic conditions, we have increased marketing spend in many markets over the last six months behind our strong brand equities. Fixed costs have increased in the second half of the year in markets where additional capacity has been commissioned, but will be more than offset by the expected utilization of this capacity in the current and future years.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, EBITA grew 6.5% as our major operating currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar in the second half versus the prior year, reversing the adverse currency impact reported in the first half. All of our key operating currencies strengthened over the last six months relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, lager volumes increased by 3% and full year organic constant currency EBITA grew 17% despite the challenging economic conditions endured for much of the year. This reflects strong sales execution and brand portfolio development across the region. Pricing taken in the prior year, positive brand mix, firm cost control and benefits from prior year restructuring initiatives led to a margin increase of 190 basis points for the year.</p>
          <p>Latin America's second half performance compared to the first half was negatively impacted by the cycling of above inflation price increases taken in the latter part of the previous year. In addition, fixed costs in the last six months were higher than those over the same period last year as fixed cost reduction programs were cycled.</p>
          <p>Colombia lager volumes made a strong recovery in the second half, resulting in lager volume growth of 3% for the full year. In Peru, volumes benefited from improved trading conditions in the fourth quarter, ending the year with lager volumes in line with the prior year.</p>
          <p>Ecuador delivered a robust performance throughout the year with a 9% growth in lager volumes. Our premium brands continued to perform well with share growth in all key markets. Organic soft drink volumes growth of 5% was primarily due to strength in Central America where soft drinks volumes grew 9% despite the difficult trading conditions.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our lager volumes declined 5% on an organic basis adversely affected by challenging economic conditions and rising unemployment. In particular tax credit conditions and restricted consumer spending prevailed during the year. This was compounded by significant excise increases in some key markets during the second half of the year leading to price increases.</p>
          <p>However, a resilient performance by our local brand portfolios led to market share gains in Poland and from Romania while the Czech Republic and Russia both held share. We achieved growth in the premium segments. EBITA for the full year grew by 4% on an organic constant currency basis. And under difficult trading conditions it is encouraging to report EBITA margin growth of 60 basis points for the year.</p>
          <p>The results of our North American segment comprise our 58% share of the results from the MillerCoors joint venture and 100% of Miller Brewing International. The comparative results for the prior year comprise the results from Miller Brewing Company as a standalone subsidiary for the first quarter and our 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture together with 100% of Miller Brewing International for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>On this basis North America delivered EBITA growth of 7% in a tough trading environment affected by economic conditions that deteriorated through the year. Both MillerCoors lager sales and sales to retailers for the year excluding contract brewing, decreased by 2% on a pro forma basis due to weakening consumer demand.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors ongoing synergy and cost reduction programs remain on track to deliver total annualized benefits of 750 million by the end of calendar year 2012. A total of $400 million annualized synergy and cost savings have been realized since the formation of the joint venture on 1 July, 2008. These synergy figures are for MillerCoors as a whole and SABMiller shares 58% of these amounts.</p>
          <p>In Africa organic lager volumes grew 6% despite generally difficult economic conditions, which were manifested in weaker local growth and currencies, increased inflation and higher interest rates. Our operations in Uganda, Zambia and Mozambique along with our associate Castel delivered strong full year lager growth which helped to offset volume declines in Botswana and Tanzania.</p>
          <p>Uganda produced lager volume growth of 24% assisted by additional capacity and new product launches. Zambia's lager volume growth of 17% was supported by excise reductions, while Mozambique benefited from the commissioning of new capacity in the north of the country.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Botswana lager volumes were severely impacted by the 30% social levy on alcohol. Soft drinks volume grew 4% on an organic basis with good growth across the region.</p>
          <p>EBITA performance in the second half of the year was adversely affected by higher raw material costs resulting from weaker local currencies, increased marketing spend and higher fixed costs. Higher marketing costs were incurred to support new businesses and the launch of a number of new brands, particularly in the local premium sector. Fixed cost increases arose from additional capacity in Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania and Sudan.</p>
          <p>In Angola, supply chain problems and delays to the opening of our soft drinks and brewery plants led to additional one-off fixed costs in the second half. The combination of all these factors reduced EBITA growth of 15% at the half year to 4% for the full year and resulted in a 90 basis point decline in EBITA margins.</p>
          <p>The strong performance from CRSnow, our associates in China, resulted in full year organic lager volume growth of 7% in Asia. China volumes grew by 10% on an organic basis assisted by increased capacity and further market share gains by the Snow brand.</p>
          <p>Asia's strong first half EBITA performance was adversely impacted by losses in India over the second half of the year as a result of reduced sales volumes and increased fixed and marketing costs. Full year lager volumes were down 14% in India, due to regulatory increases in the key states of Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and excise increases in Karnataka and Rajasthan. However, trading conditions showed signs of improvement in the fourth quarter as these regulatory issues eased.</p>
          <p>In Australia, our joint venture business delivered strong growth with Peroni Nastro Azzurro continuing to take share in the premium sector. A stronger second half volume performance which benefited from a buy-in ahead of Easter in April resulted in lager volume decline in South Africa of 1% for the year compared to a 3% decline in the first half.</p>
          <p>EBITA on an organic constant currency basis grew 2% with price increases taken across beer and soft drinks, and real fixed cost savings offsetting higher raw material costs and a significant increase in market facing investments. Marketing expenditure behind our key lager brands increased significantly over the second half of the year with increased investment levels in media and trade marketing. Mainstream volume growth was achieved through Hansa Pilsener, and Castle Lager. Our Castle Light contributed to volume growth in the local premium segment.</p>
          <p>Investment in customer facing route-to-market activities, direct distribution and improved customer service levels was increased during the year. Full year raw material input costs were up approximately 4% on the prior year on a constant currency U.S. dollar per hectoliter basis. The rate of raw material cost increases slowed further in the last six months of the year with the group benefiting from lower brewing raw material prices.</p>
          <p>Lower distribution costs throughout the year driven by lower international oil prices and some distribution efficiencies benefited overall cost of goods sold. Full year local raw material costs were negatively impacted by transactional foreign exchange costs resulting from adverse currency hedges and committed commodity arrangements in many markets.</p>
          <p>Total costs of goods sold were up approximately 3% on a constant currency dollar per hectoliter basis in the year following a 12% increase last year.</p>
          <p>Total exceptional charges of 507 million have been taken against profit before tax in the year. As announced at the time of our interim results, our business capability program is underway and we have incurred exceptional costs on the program of 342 million in the current financial year.</p>
          <p>Integration and restructuring costs of 78 million predominantly relate to charges associated with the closure of a brewery in each of Poland and Slovakia along with restructuring expenditure in relation to the Bogota brewery closure in Colombia. $18 million was the group's share of exceptional costs incurred by the MillerCoors joint venture.</p>
          <p>An impairment charge of $45 million was incurred in relation to property, plant and equipment, following the announcement of the closure of the Bogota brewery in Colombia. Other costs include $11 million in relation to broad the based black economic empowerment transaction in South Africa.</p>
          <p>As Graham has mentioned earlier, we are happy with the progress of our business capability program. Tangible working capital benefits have been realized significantly ahead of target where $333 million of the 563 million working capital cash inflow generated this year has been driven by improvements identified or initiated through business capability projects.</p>
          <p>The ongoing rollout of new systems, processes and outsourcing arrangements will lock in these working capital inflows. I believe that there are opportunities for further improvements, but the rate of working capital cash flow &#x2013; cash inflow from the business capability program will be lower in the next financial year given that the benefit delivered this year of 333 million is close to our announced three year target of 350 million which we discussed at the interims.</p>
          <p>Costs are in line with our expectations. Exceptional costs for the year are slightly under the projection we made at midyear as some elements have been deferred into the next year due to phasing of expenditure.</p>
          <p>I will now move onto group financial considerations. Our normalized EBITDA which includes dividends from the MillerCoors joint venture was up 1% on last year. Normalized EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points for the full year, principally due to the higher cash exceptional costs incurred in the current year.</p>
          <p>Our group wide focus on working capital delivered excellent results, with all regions contributing to the strong full year working capital inflow of $563 million. This result generated a year-on-year working capital cash inflow improvement of just over $1 billion, when compared to last year's results.</p>
          <p>Business capability initiatives contributed 333 million to the working capital inflow, as I mentioned earlier. Capital expenditure of $1.528 billion was $619 million lower than last year as a number of capacity related expansion projects initiated in the prior year were completed earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure in U.S. dollar terms was however somewhat inflated by stronger underlying operating currencies. Free cash flow improved by over 1.9 billion versus last year, benefiting from the net working capital improvement and lower capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>The group effective tax rate of 28.5% was 170 basis points lower than last year's rate of 30.2%, as a result of a more favorable geographic mix of profits and ongoing tax efficiency initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our underlying net debt position has improved from the prior financial year-end due to strong cash flow but this has been offset to some extent by the impact of the appreciation of our currencies against the U.S. dollar and the value of local debt in operating countries.</p>
          <p>Our financial structure improved further with gearing falling significantly to 40.8% and with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 1.8 times. We undertook a major refinancing in July 2009 with a successful debut 1 billion euro bond issue having a maturity of 5.5 years and a coupon of 5.5%. We have also renewed existing facilities as required demonstrating the financial strength and reputation of the group in banking and capital markets. Committed headroom available to the group is in excess of $3 billion as at the 31st of March.</p>
          <p>A reduction in floating interest rates has reduced our overall cost of debt with our average interest rate for the year of 6.3% down from last year's average rate of 7.7%. Our weighted average interest rate as at the 31st of March 2010 was 5.7% shown as shown on the slide, down from 7.1% at 31, March 2009. The majority of our debt continues to be held at floating rates benefiting from continued low market interest rates.</p>
          <p>The pie chart on this slide shows our net debt profiled by currency after the impact of derivatives. As you can see, we continue to maintain an appropriate and balanced net debt currency profile given the spread of our businesses. As we report in U.S. dollars, we also keep a reasonable portion of our debt in that currency. The maturity profile indicates that the majority of our debt matures after two years. We currently have substantial headroom available to refinance more than the amount of debt falling due in the next two years, in terms of existing undrawn corporate committed facilities and cash resources as well as significant in-country banking facilities.</p>
          <p>The GDP outlook for our emerging markets in 2010 indicates an improvement in economic conditions but a broader recovery in consumer spending is not expected before the second half of our financial year. Raw material input costs are expected to be flat to marginally down in the current financial year. The benefits of lower brewing raw material costs, in particular reduced barley and hop prices, will be offset to a large extent by higher sugar and packaging raw materials. However expected firmer local operating currencies against the U.S. dollar will have a favorable impact on many of our raw materials costs in some of our major markets.</p>
          <p>We will continue our focus on cash generation this year. The significant working capital improvements achieved in the year will be consolidated and where possible extended, but at a reduced rate as much of the benefit has now been taken.</p>
          <p>We expect to reduce capital expenditure to approximately 1.1 billion over the next three years. And in line with this capital expenditure for the current year is approximately or is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, some $150 million lower than the year under review. This reduction reflects lower capacity related expenditure with the completion of a number of large capacity projects in Africa and Europe last year. We anticipate that finance costs will increase marginally in the current financial year, as expected higher interest rates in the second half of the year more than offset lower net debt levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, our effective tax rate should remained between approximately 28% and 29% this year, reflecting a level which we believe is sustainable given the current composition of the group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Malcolm. So, to conclude. Although the economic environment began to improve for some of our emerging market businesses in the latter half of last year, a more general recovery in employment and consumer spending is not expected until the second half of the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Price increases will be taken selectively, predominantly in the second half and we expect raw material input costs for the year to be flat or marginally down. We'll continue to implement our cost productivity initiatives while increasing investment in our brands. The group's brand equities and its financial position remain strong and we're well positioned to manage through current trading conditions and to take advantage of a future recovery.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, we'll be happy to take questions now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Graham, you did touch upon this several occasions in your prepared remarks, but just delving a little bit more into your somewhat more cautious tone for the first half versus second half. Coming off of sequentially improved results over the course of last fiscal year, I was just curious if there is any reason why you think that some of this momentum won't continue in the first half. Or are you basically saying that we should just expect a better second half versus the first half?</p>
          <p>And also in that regard I'm curious as you're seeing a recovery in markets and looking a little bit more about improvements in consumer behavior, where are those improvements coming from? Is there better on-premise trends? Are people trading up again? Basically where is that momentum coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you say, we are cautious about momentum. I suppose actually one of the reasons for that is that we think that the financial commentary that we see around us and encounter directly has got a little bit ahead of itself in forecasting the end of the overall recession. We think that the &#x2013; well, we know that the fourth quarter in particular of our results is flattered a little bit by the inclusion of Easter by comparison with the previous fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So there's a timing of Easter effect in there. There were also some localized effects to do with the price increases and excise increases that have affected the balancing of the balance of trading between the quarters. So what we see overall is that in our more emerging markets in particular, there's a more robust tone than there was. I would exclude from that Central and Eastern Europe where the tone hasn't really improved as yet. But the emerging markets have been ahead of the developed markets in their recovery and in their growth.</p>
          <p>Now we do see, we read about and we see some signs of green shoots, but it's patchy, it's patchy by geography, and it's patchy, patchy in timing, it's a little bit sort of one step forward and two back in some cases. So what we're really saying is we don't see a broad based recovery certainly in the first half of the current year that we're in. We're not entirely sure that there will be one in the second half, but we think that there are enough perhaps forward signs for us to be a bit more confident about the second half. But overall the tone of our remarks I think you have to see against the background of other economic commentary much of which we think has, as I say got ahead of itself. Okay.</p>
          <p>As far as improvement in consumer indications in concerned, I mean, having said what I've just said about for instance, the U.S., we do see some signs of improved behavior there. We see a mild recovery in on-premise across the board, particularly in the more, in the casual dining segment, that's doing a little bit better. We see some hardening in some off-premise channels as well. As far as consumer behavior is concerned there's nothing really else that I can point to.</p>
          <p>One of the features of these economics times is that, in beer as well as in other consumer segments there's relative robustness and health at the top of the market and at the bottom of the market. And the center is squeezed or the center is perhaps a bit soggier. So, for instance, in the U.S. the below premium portfolios are doing reasonably well. The crafts are doing well and they're at high prices. But the mainstream lights in the middle are still not showing any signs of an uptick.</p>
          <p>Now that's true in other markets as well. We see broadly similar trends for instance in Europe and elsewhere. We mentioned in Africa that our launch of local premium brands has been extremely successful. So, there is a trading up dynamic still at work, although times are relatively hard and the affordable segment right at the bottom is growing as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could also ask the reason for not taking most pricing until the second half, is that due to the consumer environment still being soft and you think it's a better opportunity to wait or is it a timing issue, why is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know we use the words selective and judicious about timing, about price increases. I mean the first point it's very difficult to generalize about pricing around the world because we don't take central decisions about pricing and nor should we. They are taken very much based on local market conditions, competitive conditions, tax commodity effects and so on.</p>
          <p>We had a pretty strong round of price increases in the second half of the previous financial year, fiscal '09 going through into the first half of fiscal '10 which we've just reported on. Some of that was commodity based, some of that restoring of margins because of it and some of it due to tax increases. There's been less of that in the second half and we expect less of it in this first half. We expect a resumption in the second half of this year. But they are unique situational reasons around the world &#x2013; this is our reading of what the markets require, what our best response is rather than because of any policy edict from London.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Graham and Malcolm. Three questions please. You've announced brewery closures in Colombia and Poland and the Czech. Are those the benefits of those closures, will they show up in this fiscal year &#x2013; coming into fiscal year '11 or is that going to be slightly further out?</p>
          <p>Second question, in Africa clearly margins fell as you invested strongly in higher fixed costs in marketing. If you look forward to fiscal year 11 are we likely to see further margin contraction in the first half reflecting fixed cost investment and then the operating leverage kicking in, in the second half? Is that the right way to think through? And the third question around raw materials, you've guided to unit raw materials being flat or maybe slightly down; is that likely be true for overall COGS as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just on that last point you made about unit COGS, I think we've guided with raw materials and COGS to be flat to slightly down. So we're expecting both of those to be as I've said flat or slightly down for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Malcolm. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on your closures question, Trevor, the benefits of those are felt relatively quickly. But they're not dramatic in the broader scheme of things. And in fact Europe has seen volume, fairly severe volume declines. So although some of the closures for instance, the Azuga closure was planned at the time of the acquisition, it was really in response to declining volumes and to avoid cost de-leveraging, I suppose.</p>
          <p>Colombia to some extent as well the Colombian closure of the Bogota brewery was contemplated for long &#x2013; medium and long-term cost reasons and efficiency reasons. But the decision was crystallized for us. There was certainly help in crystallizing the decision based on the Colombian tax increase.</p>
          <p>So yes, I mean, relatively rapid payback from those closures. But they're closures in &#x2013; to really respond to downward &#x2013; in response to downward pressure. So it's difficult to separate out the benefits from them much.</p>
          <p>As far as Africa costs are concerned, yes the investment in fixed costs is inevitable. And it follows the opening of new capacity and also new marketing efforts as well as marketing costs in general. I think the benefits will start to come through more strongly in the second half. But we actually expect some benefits from or some use of those facilities in the first half itself. So, certainly in Africa I would hope that we've seen the worst of that compression and it would surely improve from here, but probably as you suggest more in the second half than the first.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just coming back to Latin America, there was a very tough margin comp from the fixed cost reductions. And I guess some of those fixed costs came back. I'm just trying to think about how the operating leverage is going to look going forward, maybe assuming slight improvements in volumes for the region if Colombia ends up being stable as you guys think. Should we start thinking about normal operating leverage going forward or are there other things to consider in that region?</p>
          <p>And then as a second question, if you're willing to share, I know you don't like giving monthly trading updates, but how has April and the start of May gone? Just to try to put in context what the timing of Easter would have done to the full year volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your question on operating leverage in Latin America, yes, I mean in general I think one would expect &#x2013; we expect the operating leverage from the growth in general to come through. But one does have to be a little bit cautious about that because remember that the growth is not uniform across Latin America either. And Colombia is still feeling the effects of the tax increase and that is our biggest market there.</p>
          <p>The other markets are profitable. But you do have to be a bit cautious about projecting operating leverage in aggregate across a whole group of markets. Because the situation is quite different between I mean, just to pick 2 at random Colombia and El Salvador. So &#x2013; yeah but in general I think the &#x2013; we should benefit in a reasonably standard way from operating leverage going through   from the growth.</p>
          <p>We don't give monthly updates as you say. I mean I think all I can &#x2013; let me just say a couple of things. One is the April, the Easter effect which you have pointed to; that is more pronounced in South Africa almost than any other market. Although it is &#x2013; it does have an effect in Latin America as well, not much effect in America at all and moderate effect in Europe and obviously nothing at all in Asia.</p>
          <p>So Easter does sort of bedevil comparisons somewhat. There's also been climate by the way. I mean we have pointed to very cold, extremely cold conditions across much of the Northern Hemisphere in spring. Hopefully starting to look better now, but it's been a very cold spring and early summer in Europe as you know as well as the U.K., much of the U.S. and in particularly in China where they've had flooding in the south, and very severe snowstorms and so on in the north so that's another factor affecting current trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a bigger picture view of the world and how it's progressing? You have your medium term guidance for all the regions, certainly we're not expecting that this year, but how would you think about this year compared to that and compared to the year that you've just reported?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What medium term guidance have we given on IRR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just in general that you have depending on region, you're expecting more volume growth than what you've reported. You're expecting price mix in line with inflation generally is the trend across the regions, margin expansion. And you add it all up together you end up with very strong operating leverage and strong organic EBIT growth. We're certainly not there yet, but how would you see fiscal year '11 versus that target versus what you just reported?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's Malcolm Wyman here. Just to answer that, obviously we've seen a slight improvement in trading conditions over the last quarter and you've seen that our margins are up and we've had growth in revenue and EBITA. So we're moving back towards the medium term guidance, but as you know we're below that this year. And I think going into F11, it's more about macroeconomic factors and demand. We've put a lot of investment in. We've seen signs of improvements, so we've got more capacity coming on stream in the growth areas. We've put marketing behind a lot of our brands. For example, the marketing cost in South Africa in the second half was up 50%, in Africa it was almost double.</p>
          <p>So there is a lot of investment going in there which impacts the margins and probably slows down us getting to the increased guidance levels that we give. But as we go into F11, we expect to get some benefit from that. So I think we're making good progress over F11 but we wouldn't expect to get there in this coming year. And of course that all depends on demand and macroeconomic factors into the following financial year. But I think we're on the way and it's &#x2013; we'd certainly say we're seeing ourselves getting towards it rather than moving away from it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentleman. Just a couple of quick questions. Firstly for Malcolm, could I get a bit more the understanding on your guidance for the finance costs which you're saying are going to be up marginally on the year? If I understand correctly your average cost of debt was 6.3 for the year gone, but closing out at 5.7. Are you saying that that 5.7 average cost of debt is going to move up so significantly that it will more than mitigate the fall-in in net debt, just to understand how we get to that guidance there?</p>
          <p>Then on the EBIT momentum into the first half of this year, given some improvement in volumes, should we expect a pick up on the 1 to 2% that we saw in the second half of the year just closed?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the Asia business the region's moved back into loss in the second half. I assume that's all India related but I just wanted to get a feel for whether that is a sort of rebasing of the Indian losses lower, or whether we could expect some degree of a reversal in the year we're in, now that some of these regulatory or market related issues are starting to move into the base? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well Chris, just covering those first of all the finance costs. They are obviously hard to read and it depends upon again macroeconomic circumstances, but in looking at our outlook and trying to give guidance you can see that we've been reasonably cautious in the first half and then looking at a broader recovery in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now I think in line with that we have assumed that there may well be a pickup in inflation and interest rates in the second half. And of course when interest rates do turn they may go up faster than one thinks. So we've built that into our thinking and again it depends on macroeconomic situation and demand because if that does not come through in the global economy, interest rates will stay lower for longer. However, I think we'd rather have the pickup in demand and consumer spending than lower interest rates. So we're working on that type of thinking that we've put into our outlook and that type of thinking would mean that finance costs would pick up and maybe move up faster than otherwise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>That's the P&amp;L cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The P&amp;L cost, so with debt falling, your average rate must have moved &#x2013; you must be achieving an average rate moving up quite a bit above 6.3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, so we're saying that we expect that, half two &#x2013; sorry, finance costs are expected to increase marginally. So you will have net debt falling and we expect that interest rates would move up reasonably fast in the second half, if our scenario of stronger economic growth and stronger consumer spending globally comes to pass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's fair. Thanks, Malcolm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just moving to the rest obviously the EBITA &#x2013; the organic EBITA growth at constant currency in the second half was reasonably low. And I think we'd just point to those factors of the increased investment in capacity and also in marketing, and so there's a substantial increase in that half.</p>
          <p>In this half particularly in Africa, where we've put down capacity and we would expect volume and more profitability to come through. So obviously we're not going to give guidance for EBITA into the first half. But if you look at the levers that are there, we would expect profitability to improve in Africa based on the fact that capacity is now coming on stream. And of course that does make a difference to the underlying growth given that fixed costs have gone up considerably, probably about a third in Africa and that marketing spend has gone up, almost doubled in Africa.</p>
          <p>And then finally in Asia, yes, the loss in the second half principally has to do with India and also a little bit with Vietnam, which is now a subsidiary since we bought up the 50% balance. But towards the second half of the year, the regulatory problems that we had were beginning to ease and we saw better trading in India. And in Vietnam things have started to pick up in Vietnam in that we are exporting quite a lot more, so trading has improved in both of those areas, but they contributed to the loss in the second half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Holland of Evolution. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Can I just pick up on something that Graham said towards the beginning, which was a reference to the Colombia excise tax being ruled unconstitutional? And I think you said that that will be reversed. Can you give us a bit more detail on that in particular, when that reversal might happen?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Botswana is there a second round of social levy increase coming up? And thirdly, could you just tell us a bit more what's going on in India when you refer to this regulation, could you be a bit more explicit as to what is actually happening there, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all right, running through those. In Colombia the tax increase &#x2013; the issue of the tax increase in addition to the size of it, of course was the fact that it was promulgated as part of an emergency decree. And the President's right or the government's right to use emergency powers to do that was contested, and in fact the government lost. But what the courts said was that yes it is constitutional, but we are not going, despite that we are not going to order that it be reversed. It can stay in place until some date in December of this year by which time we think that the government will have introduced normal legislation essentially to cement it in place.</p>
          <p>There is some activity going on about what that &#x2013; what form that legislation will take, so there may be some perhaps amelioration of the situation in the final form of the legislation, but we don't know anything about that as yet. So unconstitutional but nevertheless can stay in place which is a curious outcome you might say.</p>
          <p>In Botswana the climate is still unfriendly toward alcohol, let me put it that way. There is no immediate indication of an increase in the social levy, but there are other restrictions which are being placed on general trading. So it's a relatively unhappy situation. A lot of that of course is now pretty much in the base or settling into the base in Botswana. So we don't know of a second round as yet.</p>
          <p>In India the major regulatory dispute has been in Andhra Pradesh, also Uttar Pradesh and it's to do with pricing and essentially with state control of wholesaling and retailing. Andhra Pradesh is our biggest and most profitable market. And that situation has pretty much normalized i.e. gone back to where it should be, which is the major reason why as Malcolm said, laterally trading has improved and we expect it to continue to improve, certainly off the very poor base of the F10 year.</p>
          <p>I expect reasonably substantial volume and profit restoration in India. As I say there was issue in Uttar Pradesh as well and there are in fact tax increases and things that have been applied in other states in India as we said in the announcement. The regulatory climate in India is extremely difficult and we expect it to continue to be difficult for, I think, many years to come. However, the particular confluence of problems that we experienced in F10 we are cautiously or we're optimistic that those &#x2013; that that is over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just coming back to Botswana just very briefly. And you say there are more restrictions to come, would you anticipate volumes will be down again this year, perhaps not as much as they were in the year you've just reported but down again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I can give an actual projection for that. I think the worst the worst of the effects of the legislation have been seen already. So I don't expect dramatic decrease due to legislation in the coming year, no. But the Botswana economy has also itself taken a tremendous pounding; it's not just alcohol related as you probably know, it's to do with the mines and so on as well, exports.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a couple of things. First of all, just wondered if you'd give us an update on the regulatory situation in South Africa, both with regards to the Western Cape. Has that stopped incrementally causing you problems yet? Is it any closer to being resolved? And also, is there any sign yet of how the review of excise tax that was announced in the budget, any sign of which way that might be moving.</p>
          <p>And secondly a financial question relating to the investment in joint ventures and associates, I see in 2010, 353 into JV's, 76 into associates. Could you just clarify how much of that is Snow and what sort of figure for investments in JVs and associates should we be looking at in future years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Malcolm to handle the number on that last question. Let me just talk about the regulatory environment first. In the Western Cape the problems we think are &#x2013; well, they are in the base already. And in fact the situation has eased somewhat on the ground in the Western Cape, although there is no end in sight to the regulatory standoff dispute there.</p>
          <p>We have not been able to make our views prevail with the authorities. We think that the situation there is very poor public policy but we haven't got anywhere with it. However, it's not getting any worse, and on the ground things are probably improving. On excise, the answer is no. There has been no further movement or indication as to what the government or the Department of Finance may have in mind with its excise review. So that remains for the future.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Malcolm, do you want to talk about the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Jon, you're talking about the investments that we've made this year, net increase in investments of about 350 odd million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In JVs and then the 76 in associates. I can't remember whether Snow is an associate or a JV, and I'm just wondering this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just if you are talking about the investments in joint ventures and associates we have a net increase in investments of 353 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that's what you're referring to and that's mainly MillerCoors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's for CapEx and working capital and we have a &#x2013; if you'll recall the MillerCoors JV is a very specifically structured JV which is partnership. And what they do is that they don't have any tax or financings. We handle that all ourselves as the partners and they declare dividends equivalent to their EBITDA up to us. And we supply them with any requirements they need for CapEx and for working capital. So you will see a fairly large figure going in, which is this 353, or part of the 353 million. But remember we received dividends from JVs or from MillerCoors of over 700 million this year. So one comes out on one line as a dividend from the associates and then any cash requirements they have we reinvest which is 353 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And is that running at a abnormally high rate or is that roughly equivalent to what it would normally be do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think, that's it's not unusually high but it's not the total figure. The 353 million. We've got investment as well in another joint venture, which is Australian joint venture where we are building a brewery as you know north of Sydney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is some investment there which is probably, well it definitely wouldn't be repeated next year. So it's not running at an abnormally high level. It's probably closer to the 300 level for MillerCoors itself. Bearing in mind that this takes not only capital expenditure, it takes cash requirements for working capital and we've also put in some cash because of their requirement to help top up their pension funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And obviously that's in addition to your guidance of 1.4 billion CapEx for the rest of the business is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the 1.4 billion CapEx excludes our MillerCoors operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's out of the CapEx guidance we give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Norman of Evolution. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen. Firstly, a question on the United States. Are you confident that the robust pricing that that industry has displayed will continue? Yes there are green shoots and signs of recovery in the entr&#xE9;e, but you talk about the lagged impact of unemployment and particularly with those people where there are over indexes, so some comfort on that would be appreciated. And secondly, just your best estimate of how your market share in South Africa ended the year about which there has been some debate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well in the U.S., the answer is yes, we are on balance confident about pricing in the U.S. Or we don't see any reason to have our confidence shaken. At the beginning of every selling season, early summer there's always alarm stories about scan backs in California and deep discounts here and there and everywhere. But those don't seem to have really taken root. There has been some fairly substantial promotional activity by some of the importers as you probably know. But overall we think that pricing is still pretty firm.</p>
          <p>Yeah, and I mean the other point to notice is that, there seems to be some pressure upwards in the below premium segment to close the gaps between the below premium and the premium levels. But that's all on the upside rather than the downside. So yeah, I think that's all I'm going to say. Sorry the second question was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Estimate of market share in South Africa as you close the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, market share in South Africa is the estimates have moved around a little bit. I mean we estimate market share overall to be up in the 88 to 89 sort of range right now. And where we do think that will go? Well, we obviously wouldn't like to see any further erosion in it. I think at or around the current level would be for, over the next little while would be a reasonable outcome. There is an unknown in that which is the degree to which brand houses' difficulties with establishing its new returnable bottle system are really affecting actual sales off-take. So, there may be a little bit of wiggle room around that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our last question comes from Chris Pitcher of Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies for taking the last question with a follow-up. Could I just ask two things. You mentioned some of the currency movements going into this New Year. Could you give us a feel for in South Africa, what rate you've hedged F11 at for dollar commodities and what the level of cost of goods or input costs that is. Just to give us a feel for the year-on-year move please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well that from &#x2013; I can't give you a specific rate obviously because we still haven't hedged everything into F11 and we hedge it at various rates and we've got a whole range of commodities. But I can tell you that in F10 we had quite a lot of our commodities covered at reasonably high rates in the tens in rand to the dollar. Now some of that is running off and obviously much more of the coverage has been done over the last year at lower rates since they came down in the last nine months or so. So we would expect to see a reduction in the level of the rand/dollar rate for F11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are we talking in the region of sort of 100s of millions of dollars of benefit potentially to come through the South African P&amp;L as a result of the currency move or a couple of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not talking about major swings like that bearing in mind that the whole idea of our risk management process in managing commodities both in hedging commodities themselves and the currencies is to in fact layer on coverage on an ongoing basis, so that we take out the wild swings from up and down. But it &#x2013; so that means we never get the really high amounts, but on the other hand, we never really get the benefit of the very low the sort of trough. But so there is not &#x2013; you're not talking about 100s of millions of dollars, that's a lot of rands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but enough to certainly shore up South African margins in the current year even with an increased step-up in investment?</p>
