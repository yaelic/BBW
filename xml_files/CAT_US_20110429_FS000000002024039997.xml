          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we will open up the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group President and CFO, Ed Rapp, with me on the call today.</p>
          <p>This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording, or transmission of any portion of the call without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investors section of our Caterpillar.com website. It will be in the area labeled Results and Webcasts.</p>
          <p>This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1-A, Risk Factors, of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2011, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release.</p>
          <p>Okay, this morning we were pleased to report financial results for the first quarter of 2011 that were significantly better than last year's first quarter. Sales and revenues were over $12.9 billion, and profit was $1.84 a share in the quarter. Sales and revenues were up 57%, and profit was up over 400%. It was the best quarter for profit in our history.</p>
          <p>You'll also see in this morning's release that we raised full-year outlook for 2011 sales and revenues and profit. And to start this morning, I'll summarize the results. Then Doug, Ed, and I will take your questions.</p>
          <p>Also in this morning's release, you may have noticed that we have made changes in our reporting format, including revised segment disclosures. As a part of the strategy update that Doug rolled out last year, the company was reorganized around end-to-end businesses managed by our group presidents. That's how we are managing the company, and that's now how we are reporting.</p>
          <p>This morning's release is structured around those new segments. We're reporting sales and revenues by segment and geography, and operating segment by segment. And we're providing sales and operating profit commentary by segment.</p>
          <p>The segments that make up our Machinery and Power Systems businesses include both the sales of new equipment and aftermarket support for the businesses they serve. While there is a more complete description of each of the segments in the glossary in today's release, and I encourage you to read them, in a nutshell, the segments are: Construction Industries, which are essentially the businesses at Cat that support customers in most types of construction all around the world, everything from compact machines for a landscaper to larger machines to build a highway. Then there is Resource Industries, where we serve customers in areas such as mining, quarrying, and forestry. Next is Power Systems, which encompasses reciprocating engine and turbines across industries serving oil and gas, electric power, marine, and industrial engines; and our rail related businesses, including new locomotives from EMD and rail services from Progress Rail.</p>
          <p>We're reporting Financial Products as a segment, and there is an All Other segment. The largest sales contributor to the all other segment is External logistics and Remanufacturing. Again, I'd encourage you to read the glossary in this morning's release to better understand what is in each segment.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's get to the numbers. And again, sales and revenues were up 57%. Now in that number, Financial Products revenues were nearly flat, and Machinery and Power Systems sales were up 63% or $4.7 billion. Now in that 63% increase in sales, Construction Industries were up 71%, Resource Industries up 84%, and Power System sales were up 51%. Another way to look at the $4.7 billion increase in sales, $4.1 billion of it was from higher sales volume. And most of the sales volume increase was driven by customer demand, with first quarter dealer machine sales to end users up 61%.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the first quarter dealers did increase new machine inventory about $800 million from year end 2010. And dealers commonly increase their inventories during the first quarter of the year to support higher end user sales levels that usually occur during the spring and summer selling seasons. We do not expect to see this level of increase during the rest of the year. In the first quarter of 2010, by comparison, dealer machine inventories were about flat with year-end 2009.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to the higher volume, $295 million of today's sales increase was from improved price realization. $264 million was from the acquisition of EMD that was not included in the first quarter of 2010. And currency impacts were positive to sales by $94 million.</p>
          <p>Sales improved in all four major geographic regions: North America up 72%; Latin America up 90%; Europe, Africa, and Middle East up 67%; and Asia-Pacific up 35%.</p>
          <p>Now the increase in North America may seem surprising, with the continuing depressed level of construction activity in the United States. Housing starts are at historic lows. Commercial construction is still very weak. But in the face of weak construction activity, sales from our Construction Industry segment were up 92% in North America. While the growth rate is dramatic, remember, it's coming off of a very low base in 2010. And sales of new construction equipment in North America remain well below the 2000 peak. In fact, new machine volume is still only about half of the 2006 peak levels.</p>
          <p>Now most of the machines sold in North America we think are likely replacing aging machines in customer fleets and in dealer rental fees. During the recession, customers cut machine purchases much more rapidly and deeply than the overall construction spending decline. As a result, their fleets both shrunk in size and aged. And we're seeing that in customer fleets and we're seeing it in dealer rental fleets. We believe customers are beginning to buy enough machines now to slow or stop their fleets from continuing to degrade.</p>
          <p>Let's be clear, though. We do not think this is any kind of a bubble. It's not that customers are buying more than they need. And judging by what we're seeing in dealer rental fleets, we're not seeing increases in either fleet size or a reduction in fleet age. We believe they are essentially buying enough to keep their fleets from continuing to degrade.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a few statistics about North American dealer rental fleets that illustrate that point. Let's start with BCP [Building Construction Products] products in rental fleets. That would be small and compact machines. Rental fleet sizes are still very close to the recession low, and the fleet is older than it has ever been. In fact, the rental fleet for BCP sized product is even smaller than it was in the 2002 recession and about 50% older than it was then.</p>
          <p>It's a similar story for earth moving products in rental fleets. Despite higher sales to dealers for rental, the size of their fleets continued to decline during the quarter, and remains both smaller and older than even the 2002 recession.</p>
          <p>Dealer rental fleets for excavation products also declined in unit volume in the first quarter, despite much higher sales to dealers. Ad fleets were at their lowest levels since we've been tracking it. And the average age of the fleet is the oldest on record.</p>
          <p>Now when actual construction activities, like housing starts, commercial building, and road construction begin to improve, it will likely place additional pressure on customers and dealer rental fleets to both improve fleet age and increase fleet sizes. In short, new machine sales in the United States, while better, are still depressed and far below the peaks of 2006. When construction activity begins to improve, we expect sales will continue to improve.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to construction activity, mining and power systems improved in North America; but again, from low levels in the first quarter of 2010. Mining activity and higher commodity prices, including coal, have encouraged customers to invest in large mining equipment. And higher sales to oil and gas and electric power customers, along with the acquisition of EMD, drove the increase in Power Systems sales.</p>
          <p>Outside of North America, sales continued to improve in the developing countries around the world. Machinery and Power Systems sales increased in the developing countries of Africa, the Middle East, and the CIS. Sales were up 90% in Latin America and 35% in Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>Economic growth in developing countries has been good and is driving investment in infrastructure and increased demand for commodities, and that continues to be good for our business. A wise man at Caterpillar once said, "The road to progress begins with the road, period." And that's what we're seeing in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In Europe, sales improved as well, and the reasons were similar to those in North America, to slow or stop the deterioration in age and the size of customer machine fleets and dealer rental fleets.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's turn to first quarter profit for a moment. It was a record at $1.225 billion, and that was almost $1 billion higher than the $233 million from the first quarter of 2010. Profit per share was $1.84, more than five times the $0.36 a share from the first quarter of 2010. Higher sales volume was the primary reason that profit improved in the first quarter of 2010. Price realization was also a positive at $295 million.</p>
          <p>Now partially offsetting the higher volume and improved price realization, manufacturing costs were $219 million higher. Most of that increase was a result of higher period costs to support the large volume increases and from higher incentive compensation. Material and freight costs were also slightly higher. Considering the size of the volume increase, the scale of capacity increase projects we're working on, and commodity related pressure on material costs, cost control in the first quarter was good.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A and R&amp;D costs were also up $219 million, and driven by higher inventive compensation, costs to support new product development programs, and the impact of the much higher sales volume. While costs were up some, as a percent of sales in our Machinery and Power Systems businesses, the combined SG&amp;A and R&amp;D went from about 15.9% of sales a year ago, down to about 12% of sales this year. And that reflects our continued focus on controlling period costs.</p>
          <p>Now currency at an operating profit level was also negative. It was positive to sales $94 million, but the impact on operating costs were negative $118 million. In total then, it was negative to operating profit $24 million.</p>
          <p>Below the operating profit line, other income was $17 million. And that was down $46 million from the first quarter of 2010. And most of that reduction was mark-to-market losses on interest rate swaps that we put in place in preparation for the Bucyrus acquisition, and costs for bridge financing related to the Bucyrus acquisition.</p>
          <p>Moving down the income statement to taxes, there are two points of interest to note on income taxes. First, the quarter reflects an estimated annual rate of 29%. That's a point lower than the 30% rate from the first quarter of 2010, but it's a point higher than the 28% level that was in our full-year outlook that we released back in January.</p>
          <p>Now the second point on taxes is that the first quarter of 2010 (that's a year ago) included a discrete charge of $90 million, and that was in addition to the taxes at the estimated annual rate. That charge was related to the enactment of U.S. healthcare legislation last year.</p>
          <p>I'll cover one final point and then move on to the outlook. And that point is incremental margin, a subject I know many of you are interested in. Now we put a Q&amp;A on incremental margins in our release this morning. It's question 14 on page 17 of this morning's release. And consolidated sales and revenues were up $4.7 billion. Consolidated operating profits (these are off the face of the statements) were up $1.325 billion. That's an incremental margin rate of about 28%. But to do it apples to apples, you need to exclude the acquisition of EMD. And if you do that, it was more than 29%.</p>
          <p>Incremental margins were good in Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and in Power Systems segments. We executed well in the quarter and did a good job of controlling costs. As a result, consolidated operating profit as percent of sales was 14.2%.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's a quick review of the quarter. Let's move on to the outlook. To start, I'd like to clarify what in the outlook and what's not. In 2010, we announced three acquisitions that were large by Cat's standards: EMD, MWM, and Bucyrus. We closed EMD in the third quarter of 2010. It's in our results today, and it's in our full-year outlook. Because we have not closed either the MWM or Bucyrus transactions, neither is included in our outlook. And that's our longstanding policy; we don't include acquisitions until after they close.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, this morning we raised the outlook for 2011. We now expect sales and revenues to be between $52 billion and $54 billion, and our previous outlook expected sales and revenues to exceed $50 billion. In our new outlook, we expect profit in a range of $6.25 to $6.75 a share, and that's up from our previous outlook that expected profit near $6.00 a share.</p>
          <p>While our 2011 outlook is improved, the increase would have been greater if not for the impact of the disaster in Japan. Our facilities in Japan were not damaged by the earthquake and tsunami, but many of our suppliers in Japan were. As a result, we are experiencing sporadic production disruptions at many of our facilities around the world. These disruptions are having a negative impact on sales, factory efficiency, and costs like premium plating. While the situation has steadily improved in the aftermath of the disaster, it will likely have a negative impact on 2011 sales of about $300 million, and negatively impact operating profit by about $100 million. And the most significant impact is expected to be in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the improvement in the profit outlook, higher sales volume was by far the main driver. Overall, the net of price realization and operating costs isn't much different than our original outlook for 2010. Price realization will likely be a little bit better, but material and freight costs a little worse. On balance, though, the big driver in profit outlook is sales volume.</p>
          <p>Below operating profit in the outlook, we do expect more headwind on the tax rate. And again, we raise our full year estimate from 28% to 29%.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's it for the outlook and sales and profit in the quarter. Before we take your questions, I'd like to quickly touch on three additional points, and they are employment, cash flow, and investment in capacity. Since the end of the first quarter of 2010, we have added almost 21,000 people to our global workforce. About half our full-time Caterpillar employees, and about half are in our flexible work force. In total, that represents increase of 19% in the total global workforce. That's very positive news for employees and the communities they're located in.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, Machines and Power Systems operating cash flow improved over 50% from the first quarter of 2010 and was over $1.6 billion in the quarter. Our Machinery and Power Systems debt to capital ratio dropped from over 47% at year end 2009 to 34.8% at year end 2010 down to 30.4% at the end of the first quarter of 2011. That's a drop of almost 4.5 points from year end. Cash and short-term investment on the balance sheet almost $4.9 billion at the end of March as we're accumulating cash in our efforts to minimize or eliminate the need for new equity to fund the acquisition of Bucyrus. All in all, very good cash flow for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, investment in additional capacity is very high on our list of priorities. In fact, our current outlook for 2011 is capacity constrained for some products, such as excavators and many of our large mining products. We are investing in capacity increases around the world to be prepared for 2012 and beyond, including substantial investment in the United States. In fact, more than half of the $3 billion that we expect to spend on capital expenditures in 2011 is being invested in the United States.</p>
          <p>Expansions that have been announced around the world include: capacity expansion for mining trucks in Decatur, Illinois; a new loader powertrain facility in the U.S.; expansion of our BCP products in North Carolina; a new engineering design center in the United States; a new excavator facility in Texas; a new factory to manufacture locomotives in Muncie, Indiana; capacity expansion for mining trucks in India; significant increases in excavator capacity in China; a new factory for small wheel loaders and backhoe loaders in Brazil; a new mini-excavator factory in China; a new internal logistics center in China; and a new factory to produce 3500 Series engines in Tianjin, China. As we move forward, we'll continue to evaluate capacity needs based on our expectation of future demand.</p>
          <p>Okay, that summarizes this morning's release. And with that, Doug, Ed, and I are ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm wondering I guess if I could just start with a little bit of a philosophical question. Mike, you talked about how sales is being driven by some replacement in the fleets and that, as you pointed out, a lot of the fundamental drivers like construction spending and so forth haven't really kicked in yet. How long do we think we can continue to drive these types of strong sales just based on that type of demand? And when do we need the actual end markets to really start to kick up for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I would put a time on it. But what I would tell you right now is I think we're in a position where dealers would like to increase rental fleet sizes. I think they would like to improve the quality of fleets. For a lot of product, we are producing as much as we can, like excavators, for example. We're capacity constrained. So I think there still needs to be more, I think, upgrading of the fleets even before thinking about real, I would say, construction led demand from construction spending.</p>
          <p>Now this is going to sound like maybe an odd comment, but in a lot of ways, this has been pretty good for us. I think that as the U.S. roared back with big housing starts, a highway bill, improvement in commercial construction, it would have been very, very tough given the strength in emerging markets, I think, for us to deal with that. That's why at the end of my little intro there, that's partly why we have all those investment capacity additions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add to that, Mike. It's Doug Oberhelman here. I'm not going to put a timeframe on it either. But if you really look at what's happening in the U.S., it's a very slow recovery from very low numbers for us, which means all that is in front of us. Rental fleet rebuild, customer aging fleet rebuild, and then construction activity, so Mike is exactly right. We are in a very good position in this recovery where we can really get our factories in order, we can apply our CPS, Cat Production System, disciplines, and get this going so that when that construction activity rebounds in the developed world, call it the U.S. and certainly Western Europe, we're going to be ready. But I don't know; the economists on the call would have a lot better view of when that's going to happen than I am, but that day is coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And if I could just follow up, Mike, I understand the new segment reporting is closer to the way you guys look at things. But it leaves us a little bit high and dry as we try to think about forecasting and modeling, and I'm wondering. Based on the margins that you guys reported for this quarter, are those the right type of margins to think about going forward? Was there anything big seasonally or any other type of special situation that would mean maybe that 29%, for example, in Resources isn't what we should think about going forward, or any help you can give with the segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. I'll just point out one thing on the segments. The operating profit numbers that we're reporting, that's how we're looking at it internally. Now in the sales numbers that we're reporting by segment, that's external sales, sales to outsiders. The profit numbers include some intercompany sales as well. And you'll notice in the sales table we have some footnotes below that that show the intercompany sales numbers as well. So if you're calculating actual margin numbers to match up the sales to the operating profit number, you'd probably want to include the intercompany as well. That's why we provided the footnote.</p>
          <p>In terms of the quarter, anything unusual, I'm not sure I would qualify this as unusual or not, but we've said this before. This is not a new comment. Fourth quarter is usually seasonally a high cost quarter for us, and the first quarter is usually a seasonally low cost quarter for us. And we certainly saw that the fourth quarter of '10, and we saw that in the first quarter of this year. So typically, it's a pretty light quarter for costs. You've got R&amp;D programs that will ramp up. But in terms of &#x2013; there were no redundancy costs that we called out. There were no big, unusual items that we called out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk about inventories at the dealer level? How much room is there to still grow there? And how do you expect the wholesale and retail sales to compare as we go through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in dealer inventory, there is usually, and when I say usually, you have to temper that a little bit depending upon where you are in the cycle. But usually, the seasonal pattern is that dealers will build some inventory in the first quarter. Their big selling season, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, is spring and summer when contractors are our working more. So generally, they'll build some inventory in the first quarter. Historically, they might then use some inventory, maybe use farm inventory in the second quarter where they have bigger sales. Now for the full year, our view is that inventory will probably go up a little bit from where it's at now, but nothing on the order of the quarterly increase that we saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the retail sales numbers, we started to pick up in the first quarter of last year. In fact, you'll see the Asia numbers percentage-wise look lighter than maybe North America. And I think that probably surprises people in terms of the thinking that North America is weak and Asia is strong. I think when you look at the retail numbers, you have to step back and look at when recovery started. Recovery in Asia started earlier than it did in the U.S. and Europe. And so they're starting to lap now very good numbers. I think as we move forward and the impacts of the 2009 recession or those low, low levels get behind us, I think the retail comparisons will get tougher as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Henry, this is Ed. The only thing I'd add is that if left to their own devices, dealers would want to take the inventory level up. But in a lot of cases, we're allocating product and moving more of that inventory into the PDCs [Product Distribution Centers] and into the line configurations. And that's a real effort to make sure we have the right product in the right places; very different from the way we've managed the upturn last time around.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Mike. We've got a lot of factories around the world, a lot of products. And I'm sure if we went into any one of our factories, the product manager could rattle off a dozen components that they would like more of. But I think on balance, our suppliers have just done a fantastic job of ramping up. If you look where we came from, in the depths of say third and fourth quarter of 2009, production is significantly higher than it was then. We try to communicate as far forward as we can with our supply base. I think for the most part, they've reacted. So I don't have anything specific to call out. It's tight in a lot of areas, but our suppliers have done a great job.</p>

          <p>One of the things that you were just talking about capacity, one of the things that I've been concerned about is the time lag in being able to close the Bucyrus acquisition, and the fact that they're sold out for at least this year in their hydraulic shovel business, which, of course, is a very important asset that you're acquiring. And as you know, they're land-locked in Germany. So from their end, capacity is just flat static right now. Are you already in the process of trying to &#x2013; is this part of what Texas is? Are you in the process of building capacity so that you will be able to quickly add to their existing capacity once you take control of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug Oberhelman here, Rob. We are only going to comment on Bucyrus today about the closing that we still expect in mid-2011. But I will tell you the factory that you referred to in Texas has nothing to do with the mining business. That's a construction excavator plant only. Call it 25-ton to 35-ton machines, unrelated entirely to Bucyrus. And that's just about as far &#x2013; that is as far as we'll go today with Bucyrus. Everybody is working hard to get it closed. We expect in 2011 to get it done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my follow-up has to do with your expectations for dealer inventory growth. I'm interested in both the $800 million in the quarter and your expectations for the full year. Can you talk about where that will be concentrated by segment within the new segments? I'm guessing most would be at DCP, construction in other words.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's where most of it is. There's not a lot of mining inventory. That's a pretty easy one to say yes to. I think geographically, I'll just start off. The $800 million that we're already up in the first quarter, our expectation is that we're probably not going to end the year a lot higher than that; somewhat higher, but not a lot higher than that. So I wouldn't expect big changes from the end of the first quarter by the time we get to year end.</p>
          <p>Now there might be up and down during the year. Again, the second quarter is usually a big quarter for sales to users in terms of actual volume. And so it's not unusual for dealers to take inventory down a little bit in the second quarter. But I don't think for the full year &#x2013; at least our view is that it won't be a lot higher than where we ended the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regionally, all regions were up in the first quarter except Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific actually declined just a touch. And I think that reflects a point that Ed made earlier. Dealers would like to take more inventory if they could. If you could take Asia, for example, our excavator production in China, we're going full out. I think if we could get more products of some things like excavators, we would certainly put more in lane inventory. And I think that dealers could &#x2013; even though we're trying to put as much as we can into lane inventory to get it distributed well, you could probably make a good case for some dealers needing a bit more.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Ted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So I think, speaking for myself and probably for a lot of people, I'm trying to calibrate our expectations around the new reporting format. But as it relates to the incremental margins for what historically was the Machines business, and now I guess we'll call it the construction industries and resource industries, one more quarter into the recovery, it will be great to get your updated sense for how you think the opportunity on the incremental margin side is. And as a second part, whether it's Doug or anybody else on the call, could you just compare and contrast the opportunity that you see within Machines relative to engines when you took over that business and made the dramatic improvements there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the first part of that. When we came into 2011, if you go back to our original outlook, we said we expected incremental margins in the neighborhood of 25% this year, for the full year. And if you look at our outlook today, we've revised the sales number up and we've revised the profit number up. And I think the incremental margins embedded in that aren't a lot different than what we said before. We did a little bit better than that in the first quarter. And if you look at the year-over-year sales increase, the first quarter of a year ago was still coming off of &#x2013; let's just call it recession lows. And sales really started to improve through last year.</p>
          <p>So if you look at first quarter to first quarter, it will probably have the most significant year-over-year, comparatively, increase in volume. And the bigger your volume increase, in a lot of ways, the easier it is to get high incremental margins. So I think it's not surprising that the first quarter is a bit better than what we were expecting for the year. On balance, I don't think our expectations for incremental margins for the year are significantly different than how we started out the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure &#x2013; Doug Oberhelman here &#x2013; I got the back end of the question vis-&#xE0;-vis engines. But what I will tell you is that we have the entire leadership team of the company and we communicate with employees constantly on this idea of incremental margins and profit pull-through. It's a big deal inside our company and it's a motivator to many. The segmentation presentation that we provide this quarter is what our leaders use internally as well. That's the document we all are motivated by. What you see is what we see and how we manage.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, Mike is exactly right; the 25% incremental margin we want for the rest of the year in our outlook is what we expect to deliver. And that's one of the better years in the last many in terms of year-over-year improvement, which we're pretty happy with. It's something that is a key core metric of ours internally. The Executive Office; that is all the group presidents and myself look at this continually. And that's how we do our business planning and so on and will into the future because the history of '06, '07, and '08 is still pretty fresh. And the success we had &#x2013; I think your point on the engine business is the one we modeled the Machine business after, and we're seeing that here in the last couple quarters as well. Certainly, the first quarter is very rewarding for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. That's &#x2013; I'm sorry to interrupt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I was going to ask is when you think about the longer term opportunity, not as much just 2011, if you were to look at the engine segment between '02 and '09, sales growth was similar to your peer group. And yet your margin expansion was 1,200 basis points; the peer average was 200 basis points. And so if we try to apply that construct to the opportunity within what was historically the Machines business, I'm just curious to get a sense how you think about the increased opportunity from here longer term, say over three to five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'm not going to &#x2013; we don't really &#x2013; I'm not going to talk about that five years out. But we certainly have talked about it internally, where we want to be, and that is one of our metrics. And as we've talked to all of you in New York at the Exchange last year, at 2015 the goals we laid out for that really get us to this kind of a profit pull-through. So yes, I think you could &#x2013; I don't know what it is vis-&#xE0;-vis the peer group. But certainly in terms of where we want to be by the end of '15, that's a key piece of getting us there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Longbow Securities; good morning, everyone. And wow is probably the best thing. Could we go back and talk a little bit more about the profitability? You gave us a one-quarter comparison. I hope you'll restate the quarters quickly for last year. And Resources is the one that sticks out when you show a 28.8% margin, I guess. Even if you add back sales, it's 26%. That doesn't seem to be like a normalized profitability. And I think it's a question; we're trying to get a sense of what's a normalized profitability.</p>
          <p>Can you put it into context with the guidance that you gave us? Because what you effectively said for the rest of the year, assuming that you're not being ultraconservative, is that the sales number for the rest of the year doesn't change a lot, but your quarterly profit report goes down 10% to 20% on average from this huge first quarter. So I was just trying to reconcile the two. It has to be at some point, it suggests that the operating profitability would be lower in this segment based on what we saw in first quarter. So I'm trying to get idea of what more normalized numbers would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a couple of things. It is our intention to restate the quarters of last year, and we'll do that as quickly as we can. I would expect that it's likely that we'll have that done before we talk and disclose it before next quarter. I think we'll be able to do that. So that might give you at least some quarterly perspective from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Resource industries include mining, which is, shall we say, more profitable than the total. One thing you need to remember, though, when you're thinking about the numbers in total, there's a line within our segments that has corporate costs. And there are some costs in our business, things like, I'll give you some examples, our Corporate Treasury group, our Tax group, part of our Human Resources group, part of our Legal group, some of the pension costs that aren't related to service costs, they're not included in the individual segments. So you'll see those as a negative when we sum up the segments plus that to get to the total. So if you were looking at Machinery, for example, before as we reported it, we would have allocated all that to Machinery and Engines, and now we're not. So I think it probably will help when we can give you a little bit more historic data. Again, Resource Industries is more profitable than our average segment, no doubt about it.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of the year, I touched on this. The first quarter is usually a pretty light cost quarter. The fourth quarter is pretty heavy. The first quarter is pretty light. You saw that. In addition to that, I think what we're going to see as we move through the year is probably a little bit more headwind on material costs. In the first quarter, we didn't say much about it in the release because it was just slightly negative. It was not a big deal in the first quarter. But as we go through the year, that will likely be more of a headwind as we go forward. And things like R&amp;D costs, for example, I think that will probably go up. And then of course in the second quarter, that's where we would expect to see the vast majority of the impacts from the disaster in Japan. So that's having a little bit of negative on the rest of the year, particularly the second quarter as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I'm driving at is when volume goes up a little bit  from the first quarter and we're looking at a somewhat lower quarterly report, can we get some calibration of where the decline is coming from in profitability? Is it in the segment stuff, or is that the consolidated corporate cost number? Give us some idea of how to handle that as you go through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be in the segments. Material costs would be in the segments. The impact from Japan would be in the segments. So yes, it would be most likely in the segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to follow up, can you give us some idea of how much capacity space you have left for increased volume? In your reporting, are we pretty full out at this point in Resources because you can't expect much change in volume from the first quarter, and the rest of it comes from construction? Give us some sense of where the volume change is that we're seeing for the rest of the year can come from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a little bit of a hard question to answer, partly because some of the ramp up issues one would have, particularly in the short term, aren't necessarily capacity driven. I'll just give you an example. If you look at big diesel engines, we're definitely not at capacity in Lafayette to do more. But there is fairly long supply chain on some of the big key components, and you can't change that production on a dime. So for that, we couldn't take up production rapidly within a month, but that doesn't mean that we're at capacity.</p>
          <p>For things like excavators and much of the large products, trucks, bulldozers, we're running pretty well flat out right now. We're actually doing better. We've been able to get out more I think in both those product areas than we did last year. We've got more investment going in place to try and get that up. So I don't know how to quantify it because you have to look at it product by product, and then figure out what that meant for the supply chain to get it back to the number this year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Goldman Sachs. Mike, the high end of your sales guidance implies low production increases from seasonally weakest sales quarter. Is that a contingency for Japan and broader supply chain tightness? And I'm wondering if you can touch on what your supply on-time deliveries were in the quarter. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it does reflect, again, for a lot of product, we are producing all we can today. Again, the big product, a lot of the big product, underground mining trucks and excavators, which are pretty key products, it also reflects fairly long lead times for some of the other products, and it also reflects Japan. And we expect the second quarter to be negative there. And a lot of that is in products that we effectively don't have capacity to make up later on in the year, again, like excavators, for example. So we do have increases built into the rest of the year in our sales outlook at the midpoint and at the top end. But they are limited somewhat by our ability to produce. Now I mentioned this in my lead in. Our sales forecast, if it weren't somewhat capacity constrained from a demand standpoint, could be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>It looks like your inventories were up nicely in the quarter. Can you give us an update on your lane strategy fill rates? And what are your updated targets for this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jerry, this is Ed. If you look at lane performance in the first quarter, 70% of the volume went out within 10 days, and so we're seeing good performance in that area. As I said earlier, dealers would take more inventory, but we continue to herd it into lanes to make sure we have the right product in the right place. In fact, we actually increased lane inventory during the quarter, as we've continued this commitment that we made in this ramp up of making sure we have the right product in the right place.</p>
          <p>There's more build-out of the PDCs to come in the second quarter, and we've got product diverted into the lanes to make sure we have good product availability and we can maximize those end-user sales. I think you're seeing the benefits of that with the rolling three-month data we've been providing on end-user sales. So I'd say the lane strategy is moving ahead, and the strong demand and puts that under pressure. But we remain committed to. It is one of the things that's going to help us manage this upturn far better than we did the last time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to clarify, what proportion of your lane one target products are you stocking within that 10-day period? Is that that 70% number, or are we talking about out of the product that you stock, 70% is within 10 days? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be &#x2013; the 70% would be across the spectrum of our product line versus that target.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>ISI, good morning, a quick question on the rest of the year implied guidance. Essentially, it looks like you're implying incremental margins of only 10% year over year for the rest of the year. Can you give us a little more granularity on what &#x2013; you went through roughly some of the cost issues. But it just seems like a very low incremental margin for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm not going through the math, but I don't think it's quite that low. And remember, you need to deal with EMD and whatever calculations you're doing because that's adding to sales, at least for the second and third quarter, without adding much to profit. And then remember, we've got Cat Japan in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>But I think there's no doubt, at least in my mind, that we had the most significant volume increase in the first quarter. And just on a quarterly basis, that gives you the most opportunity, I think, to show really good incremental margins. In quarters where there's less volume increase, I think it's tougher. But I think that 10% number is too low. We're looking for about 25% for the year. We had 28% to 29% in the first quarter.</p>

On the Equipment Company first quarter, working capital actually a source of funds; that hasn't happened since '98, and '98 was even an anomaly because that's when you were first selling receivables in the Equipment Company over to Cat Financial. Maybe it has never happened, at least from my data, obviously very impressive. Can you give us some thoughts then on how you're viewing cash flow for the year on the Equipment Company? Again, it's a unique start to the year to have working capital as source of funds.</p>

          <p>David, I'm going to let Ed answer that. But you're seeing the increasing number of never-as-before in front of your eyes, and this is one of them. And we like that part, and that's where we're headed, as we talked to all of you last year, that we're going to be in the territory here the next couple years where we've never been before, and we're starting to see results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and David, it ties into a number of things. One, when we rolled out the strategy, we talked a lot about the balance of the focus on the P&amp;L and also on cash flow and moving it to a top-tier metric. And as we've really driven this and cascaded it down here into the organization, I'd say number one, we're getting good traction on that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we talked about our desire to minimize the need for equity related to Bucyrus. And we've got the organization clearly focused on what we collectively have to do as a group to make that happen. And in fact, if you look at that measured from a debt-to-cap perspective, we finished the first quarter with the strongest balance sheet we've had in more than 20 years. So I think you're seeing the traction come from the deployment of the strategy, the focus on cash flow, and really driving it down through the organization. It came through with good numbers in the first quarter. And as you think about the opportunities that we have ahead of us in terms of the industries we serve, the capacity increases we talked about, we've got the organization clearly understanding that generating strong cash flow is where we're going to fund that growth going forward.</p>

          <p>I know, obviously, there were a lot of positives <mark type="ph" /> this print, but that was probably the most impressive. Are you willing to at least give us some kind of range on how you're thinking about operating cash flow for the year?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we've historically not given guidance on that. What I would say is that based on what we clearly articulated relative to the top-tier metrics, we've rolled out the strategy, the balance of our focus, zero equity in terms of the target, if you would, on Bucyrus, we're going to be all over cash flow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I might just chime in here a little bit. In one metric that we watch and that's working capital to sales, we're benchmarking the best in the capital goods industries, and that's our target here over time. And granted, it's going to take maybe to 2015 to get there. But we're seeing a down payment on that. So I would just generally think about that and the best in capital goods as to where we intend to be no later than 2015.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys, JPMorgan. I'd like to just follow up on David's question and ask it a little bit differently. Doug, would you be disappointed in the businesses if they did not deliver 25% incrementals in each quarter going forward, other than maybe construction next quarter because of Japan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm really focused on 2012 and '15. I would expect the group presidents in charge of these businesses, in this case, Rich Lavin and Steve Wunning, to use those, and they are, as their top-tier metrics. And that's a question that they would have for their teams. I know they're concentrating highly on it. But in terms of quarter-to-quarter stuff, there's so much &#x2013; so many variables and change, I'm really trying to get us to '12 and '15 a big way. And they handle the day-to-day, quarterlies, and everything in their business, Ann. That's the way I look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good color, I appreciate that. And then a separate question, it's a tough question to ask. But Japan is a headwind right now. At some point, I think we would all anticipate that that could turn and could become a tailwind. The way we look at it is we would likely see demand for power generation for the engine business pick up first, and then later some, perhaps much later, demand for rebuilding equipment may pick up. Is that the right way to think about it, and how do you guys think about it internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll comment here, and you're right. This is a tough one to talk about. This will profoundly change the country of Japan for decades. It will profoundly change the way that industry is viewed inside Japan for a long time as well. While there will be rebuilding opportunities down the road, and certainly we've seen Power as we would typically do after a disaster of this kind, lead the way, it's hard for us to really talk about that. We're still making sure our supply chain is right. We were so fortunate that our own Japanese employees and facilities were not hurt. But having said that, every one of our Japanese families have either a relative, friend, or something that has been touched very deeply with this. So we're not pushing that too hard, and I'm going to shy away from that answer, Ann, except that generally and in all other disasters, that's the flow in which we've seen recoveries.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Credit Suisse; and congratulations. Two questions, Mike. I'm going to try the guidance one more time. Your first quarter, you came in at $1.84; Q1 seasonally a weaker quarter, which implies at the midpoint, we're only going to do on average about $1.55 a quarter. I get we had high volumes. Japan is only $0.10 cents. Your R&amp;D was up 30% in the quarter. You're saying 20% for the year. I understand the dollars get bigger, but is material cost that material, or is it we're only in the first quarter, so why set the bar high?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, just broader commentary on Tier 4; Tier 3 was a big issue for Caterpillar last cycle. I'm just wondering how that's going relative to expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. Normally, first quarter is a pretty seasonally low quarter for our sales. I think that trend is probably a little bit muted in situations where you're constrained on production. So I think, again, if there weren't any production constraints, there weren't any capacity issues, I think our sales number, as we said, would have been higher, and you might have seen more of a seasonal pattern. But I think probably because of production constraints on excavators and large product, our expectation is that seasonal variation won't be quite so much. And it is early in the year. There's a lot you don't know. And we do expect that material costs will go up somewhat from here. We expect &#x2013; you're right. Year over year, R&amp;D was up. But if you look at it sequentially as we go through the year, it's going to go up in the first quarter, as it did last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jamie, I'll cover Tier 4. I'd say at this point in time, it in the early innings, but I'd say we're cautiously optimistic. If you think back to when we first got into it, a lot of people were talking about Tier 4 being a sacrifice on fuel economy, I think, almost across the board. Our Tier 4 machines are actually going to offer improved fuel economy. There was a lot of fear about the need for operator intervention. We've almost completely removed that from the equation, so I think customer feedback on that has been positive. I think the team has done a good job of using technology in terms of getting immediate feedback back in terms of the issues in the product development cycle. And we have leveraged our supply base in a number of areas across the platforms of our machines. So I'd say early days, but I'm much more confident in terms of where we're at Tier 4 versus where we were at with Tier 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Morgan Stanley, good morning, everybody. My question is from the outside, the margins, obviously, look extraordinary this quarter and really impressive. I wanted to ask from the inside, when you look at your internal metrics, whether it be rework, quality or <mark type="indiscernible" /> quality, all the things that you talked about in '09, whether it feels just as good, better, or whether you're seeing some of the signs of strain that you saw at last peak in '07 &#x2013; '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be happy to take that one, Rob. It's Doug Oberhelman here. Generally, across the board on internal metrics that we use, those that you mentioned and others, but the biggest one is the external metric, and that's incremental profit pull-through, which in my mind is the culmination of all those things that have to happen internally. We are seeing vast improvement from '06, '07, '08, and '09.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, we are running more and more of our plants have capacity. As we go up that chain, we're working through those. We have a far different and, I'm going to say, far better global purchasing and supply chain management team around the globe that learned from the prior experience and have put in processes that have changed. So without question, our CPS metrics are better, every single metric that we would use and you would see inside our factories as you go through we put on metric boards than they were three, four, five years ago. We're not where we want to be. Our goals are still down the road for us from where we want to be, but we're getting there. And I think I've often said that it's probably going to be late '11 &#x2013; '12 before we really see a lot of those internal metrics get to the goals that we want as we continue investments to make the changes that we have to get them where we want to be. There is some ahead improvement in front of us, but there's no question we are moving up the scale operationally and internally. I'm very, very pleased with our team on that.</p>
