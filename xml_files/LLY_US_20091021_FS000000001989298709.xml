          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by and welcome to the Q3 2009 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, instructions will be given to you at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And I would now like to turn the conference over to the Executive Director of Investor Relations, Phil Johnson. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Steve Paul and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen from Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectation. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast and internet-based replay and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay and to podcast will be available on our website through November 20, 2009.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we again generated strong financial results including volume-driven revenue growth, leverage between revenue growth and operating income growth, robust EPS growth and strong operating cash flow. This financial performance gives us the resources we need to strengthen our pipeline, to deal with the patent expirations coming in the next decade and to respond to our challenging healthcare environment. Now I'll turn the call over to John for review of key events since our last earnings call.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Phil. During the third quarter we took bold steps to reshape our operations. We unveiled a new corporate operating model as well as a series of changes designed to speed medicines to patients, to deliver greater value and to lower our costs. I'll have more to say about these changes in a minute.</p>
          <p>Now aligned with these plans, we offered a voluntary exit program in select areas of our U.S. sales force. We're implementing a new commercial approach in 2010 that's designed to deliver more value to our customers and to be more efficient. We agreed to sell our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site to an affiliate of Evonik Industries.</p>
          <p>This deal provides a continuous reliable supply of human and animal health products to Lilly. It preserves high-quality manufacturing jobs for the Indiana economy and enables us to lower our costs overtime. In regulatory news, FDA approved FORTEO for the treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained, systemic glucocorticoid therapy in men and women at high risk of fracture, and we submitted BYETTA in Japan for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults.</p>
          <p>In clinical trial news, based upon the outcome of the Phase III GENERATIONS trial, we announced that we will not submit arzoxifene for regulatory review. While the study met its primary efficacy endpoints, it did not meet key secondary efficacy and safety endpoints. As a result, we did not feel arzoxifene would offer a competitive value proposition. This decision led to a charge to earnings of approximately $45 million in the third quarter, most of which was booked in R&amp;D expense.</p>
          <p>Along with BioMS we announced the results of the two year MAESTRO-01 Phase III trial, which showed that dirucotide did not meet the primary endpoint of delaying disease progression in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The Company has announced that we're stopping clinical trials.</p>
          <p>On a more positive note, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule for our IDENTITY 1 trial, the first of two Phase III trials of semagacestat for Alzheimer 's disease.</p>
          <p>On the legal front, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, upheld the Company's method-of-use patents on EVISTA. These patterns run through March of 2014. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted a partial summary judgment motion in validating the Company's method-of-use patent on GEMZAR, which had been set to expire in May of 2013. We continue to believe that our GEMZAR method-of-use patent is valid and will be upheld by the courts. We intend to pursue an appeal of this decision with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
          <p>The Canadian Federal Court ruled that Lilly's Canadian compound patent for Zyprexa is invalid. We believe this decision is deeply flawed and that it is inconsistent with the evidence that was presented at trail and with applicable law. We intend to appeal this decision and protect Lilly's intellectual property rights regarding the validity of the Zyprexa patent in Canada through April 2011. Finally, we reached settlement with the Attorneys General of West Virginia, Connecticut, South Carolina and Idaho, resolving their Zyprexa-related claims.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're in advanced discussions with eight other state's Attorneys General. As a result, in the third quarter we incurred a special pre-tax charge of $125 million to adequately reserve for the currently probable and estimable exposures in connection with the State's claim.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to share a few of my thoughts about the changes we announced in mid September, which are the most sweeping in Lilly's history. We're reorganizing the development function within Lilly Research Laboratories. Now a Development Center of Excellence will employ a variety of tools to speed molecules to patients. We're reorganizing our global operation to around five business units. And we're streamlining and aligning our corporate services and general and administrative functions.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we aim to reduce our cost base by $1 billion and lower our head count to 35,000 by the end of 2011, excluding strategic sales force additions in high-growing emerging markets in Japan. There's been considerable coverage of these changes in the media and on Wall Street, much of it focused on the cost savings and the head count reductions. In fact, our key objective is to fulfill our strategy of creating value by accelerating the flow of innovative new medicines that provide improved outcome for individual patients.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to innovation will not waiver. These organizational changes are primarily intended to reduce the time it takes to get medicines to patients, to establish a clear line of sight to our customers and to reduce our operating cost structure, thereby freeing up the resources necessary to fund the innovation that will drive our future growth.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the changes in R&amp;D. Over the past few years we significantly improved productivity and research, leading to an unprecedented number of Phase I starts, 15 in 2007, 17 in 2008 and 13 so far this year. Internal research has been and will continue to be the primarily driver for our long-term viability and must remain intact. As a result, there are no significant changes occurring in our basic research area. While we're reorganizing development to ensure we move these molecules quickly and get the most out of them. We're creating the Development Center of Excellence or COE to address a drug development process that is increasingly complex, slow and expensive, not just at Lilly but across the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, what makes the Development COE different is that we will use one common operating system, one common set of priorities and a singular focus to streamline the development of new medicines. The common operating system will provide our scientists with a simpler way to organize and get work done. Common priorities will help each function in the COE know where to focus their resources and their efforts. And the singular focus means that we'll now have one single point where decisions will be made. Again, the ultimate goal of the Development Center of Excellence is to accelerate the development and launch of Lilly molecules over the next decade and bring innovative medicines to patients sooner.</p>
          <p>Next, in addition to our existing animal health business unit, we're organizing our human health business around four distinct business units &#x2013; one for oncology, one for diabetes, a business unit for established markets and one for emerging markets. Each business unit will be charged with creating a competitive, sustainable business. In addition to commercial responsibilities they will all reach back into development and partner with research to bring forward valuable innovative molecules for their customers. The business unit heads will report directly to me.</p>
          <p>I expect this structure to drive more accountability, to establish clear authority and ultimately to provide our customers with greater value. These changes, the Development Center of Excellence and new the business units will be in place on January 1, 2010.</p>
          <p>We will also streamline corporate and general and administrative function to support the business through improved quality, better customer service and reduced cost. We anticipate that the streamlined function will be in place by mid next year.</p>
          <p>Now, Derica will discuss our third quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John. As I've done on previous calls, today I'll focus my comments on the pro forma non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insight into the underlying trends in the business. Now this view assumes we owned ImClone as of January 1, 2008 and it excludes certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.</p>
          <p>Now let's start our slide 12 with a quick look at our Q3 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and operating income. As third quarter revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew a robust 17%. The leverage between revenue and operating income was driven by a 3.7 percentage point expansion in our gross margin percent.</p>
          <p>The increase in the gross margin percent from 77.4% to 81.1% is due to the favorable effect on cost of sales arising from the effect of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on international inventories that we sold during the period. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar added to the cost of sales in Q3 of 2008, while lowering costs in Q3 of 2009. In addition, this quarter operating expenses which we've defined as the sum of R&amp;D and SG&amp;A grew slightly faster than sales.</p>
          <p>Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 2%. While R&amp;D expense grew 13% due to the increased late-stage clinical trial costs, as well as the costs of terminating the development of arzoxifene.</p>
          <p>Moving down in the income statements, you'll also see a slight improvement in other income due to lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate improved by about two percentage points due to a projected change in the mix of income among tax jurisdictions and also the final resolution of our 2001 to 2004 IRS audit. As a result of these modest improvements in other income and the effective tax rate, net income and EPS both grew faster than operating income of 22% compared to 17%.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to slide 13 which shows our reported income statement, while slide 14 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 results, starting with revenue. As you can see on slide 15, total revenue grew 5% on a pro forma basis which includes a negative 3% impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact, total revenue grew 8% driven by a robust 6% volume growth. This volume growth was consistent across all major geographies. Japan's volume growth was largely driven by ALIMTA, which was approved earlier this year for both 1st-line and 2nd-line non-small-cell lung cancer.</p>
          <p>Also, animal health volume growth benefited from the inclusion of U.S. POSILAC sales after our acquisition of Monsanto's dairy business in Q4 of last year. As you'll see on slide 16, we provided the price rate and volume analysis on a reported basis. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our pro forma non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw earlier on our pro forma non-GAAP income statement. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the impact of foreign exchange rates on our pro forma non-GAAP results.</p>
          <p>Now first, you'll see the 8% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales and operating expenses grew in line with revenues this quarter. The 8% performance growth in operating expenses was driven by an increase of 5% in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, and an increase of 14% in R&amp;D. Our 8% performance growth in revenues translated into 8% performance growth also at operating income. EPS grew slightly faster at 11%, due to year-on-year favorability and other income and the effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>Finally, you'll see in the last column that year-to-date, we've grown revenue faster than both cost of sales as well as operating expenses, which has led to a 14% performance growth in operating income and EPS.</p>
          <p>Now for your information, on slide 18 we provided the year-on-year growth of select items of our reported income statement, both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Comparisons of 2009 to 2008 operating income and EPS are not meaningful due to charges taken in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, let me wrap up my comments with an update of our 2009 financial guidance. If you take a look at slide 19, let's discuss a few high level trends for the remainder of the year. In terms of operating performance, we expect continued volume-driven revenue growth. We also expect revenue growth to exceed growth in operating expenses. And, regularly scheduled maintenance shutdowns at our manufacturing sites should put upward pressure on our cost of goods sold. In terms of the impact of foreign exchange, at current rates FX should have a modest positive impact on international revenue and income.</p>
          <p>However, we do not expect the substantial cost of sales benefit from FX related to international inventories sold in the first nine months of the year to be repeated in Q4. At current FX rates, we can see a significant addition to cost of sales in the fourth quarter. In addition, year-on-year comparisons will be affected by the significant reduction to cost of sales booked in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>With this context, let's move to slide 20 to summarize our 2009 guidance. Given the strong performance in the first nine months of the year, we are raising our previously issued 2009 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to 4.30 to a new range of $4.30 to 4.40 on a pro forma non-GAAP basis. This corresponds to a range of 3.90 to $4 on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of line-item guidance, we expect total revenue to grow low to mid single-digits on a pro forma basis and mid single-digits on a reported basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year is expected to increase on both a pro forma non-GAAP and reported basis.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we expect a significant decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to show flat to low single-digit growth. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the high single-digits on a pro forma non-GAAP basis and low double-digits on a reported basis. Our other income for the year is still expected to be a net deduction of between 200 and $250 million, as well as the effective tax rate for the full year should now be approximately 21% on a pro forma non-GAAP basis and 20% on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be less than $1 billion for the year. Now let me turn the call over to Nick and Ronika for our product review and pipeline update. Nick?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Derica. As you can see on slide 22 and as mentioned earlier, in Q3 we again posted volume-driven revenue growth continuing the trend we've seen for most of this decade. In the lower chart, you will see the contribution made by select products to our worldwide volume growth of 6%. ALIMTA, Cymbalta, Zyprexa and Humalog were the principle drivers. GEMZAR's international volume fell 30% compared to Q3 2008 because of generic competition which cut volume growth of total revenue by nearly 1.5%. Last quarter we discussed underlying prescription and share of market trends for Cymbalta, ALIMTA, CIALIS and BYETTA.</p>
          <p>This quarter we'll take a look at Humalog and provide an update on the launch of Effient. We've seen an encouraging trend in the mealtime analog insulin market during Q3. Humalog had been losing share to NovoLog for over a year, especially in the primary care physician segment. Over the last three months Humalog's new-to-brand share gains have been impressive in both the endocrinologist and primary care settings.</p>
          <p>We achieve these results by applying our increased understanding of the mealtime insulin experience for both patients and healthcare professionals, which has enabled our sales force to have more valuable customer interactions and dedicate more focus to the Humalog brand. The Humalog KwikPen which we believe is best-in-class in the mealtime insulin market continues its strong sale performance.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to Effient, our new treatment for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI. We received FDA approval for Effient in mid-July, we launched in the U.S. in early August and we're diligently executing our launch plan. Obtaining hospital formulary status is critical to the uptake of a hospital-based product like Effient. As we've said in the past, gaining widespread hospital formulary status will take roughly six months. To date, we're on track to achieve our hospital formulary goals.</p>
          <p>As we move forward, in addition to working to gain formulary status we'll be focused on communicating formulary availability to physicians and seeking initiation of appropriate ACS/PCI patients; particularly those under 75 years of age and those over 132 pounds of body weight who have not had a TIA or stroke.</p>
          <p>Peer access is also meeting our expectations of interim formulary status of tier 3 unrestricted. We're especially pleased that as of October 1, Effient has tier 2 unrestricted access with Express Scripts in both commercial managed care and Medicare part D.</p>
          <p>In Europe, despite receiving regulatory approval in late February this year, we're still early in the process of gaining pricing and reimbursement access at the individual country and hospital level. For example, we received a positive NICE recommendation for England and Wales in September, however this recommendation will only become final later this month and then individual hospitals will have up to 90 days to implement this approval.</p>
          <p>We've also received positive reimbursement in access decisions in a number of countries including, Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, New Zealand and most recently Switzerland. France also has recommended reimbursement of Effient; although it will be some time before pricing discussions conclude. We hope to fully launch the products in France, Italy and Spain during 2010. As in the U.S. we're making good progress and expect Effient prescription volumes to build overtime.</p>
          <p>Now, Ronika will provide a brief update on our pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>As we communicated in earlier press releases, we're disappointed about the losses of arzoxifene and dirucotide. Our decision not to submit arzoxifene for regulatory review was based on an overall clinical profile of the compound in light of currently available treatment, including our own of EVISTA. And then the Phase III MAESTRO-01 pivotal trial dirucotide did not meet the primary objective of delaying disease progression in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>Despite these disappointments, we still have a robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 61 distinct NMEs, including 23 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent over half of our late stage Phase II and Phase III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our focus has not changed, advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows on slide 25, since our last formal portfolio update during the second quarter earnings call, we've initiated Phase II clinical trials on IL &#x3B2; an antibody for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and we've moved three more compounds in the Phase I tested, two for diabetes and one for depression.</p>
          <p>As is the nature of our business, we also terminated development of eight other assets, two in Phase II and six in Phase I. You may recall that in Q1 and Q2 we only had one Phase I and one Phase II termination. Running the right experiments to enable early go/no-go decisions and knowing when to stop development is just as important as advancing assets, allowing us to refocus our time and money on more promising molecules. Now let me turn to slide 26 to highlight select milestones between now and mid-2010.</p>
          <p>In regulatory actions we could have FDA action on BYETTA monotherapy and Zyprexa LAI this year and on the Exenatide Once Weekly and Cymbalta for chronic pain in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, the FDA raised concerns about the pharmacokinetic comparability data in our sBLAs for Erbitux in first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and first-line non-small-cell lung cancer.</p>
          <p>Later this year, we'll meet with the FDA to discuss our path forward. Pinning the outcome of this discussion we hope to resubmit the non-small-cell lung cancer sBLA and respond to a head and neck cancer's Complete Response Letter by late this year or early next year. And we expect to initiate a number of Phase III trials in oncology late this year or early next year including ImClone's 11F8 and A12 and our own tasisulam.</p>
          <p>In addition, early next year we hope to begin stand-alone Phase III clinical trials on GLP-Fc and diabetes. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question comes from John Boris with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. First question just has to do with the revised guidance if I just take the midpoint of that range and assign a 10 or 15% growth rate to that. I'm coming up with an earnings estimate that could be in the 4.79 to $5.00 range, I guess not looking for specific guidance even though you'll deliver that in December. But can you help us understand what some of the pushes and pulls are going into 2010 that we should be thinking about from a modeling standpoint?</p>
          <p>Second question just has to do with formulary uptake on Effient, both on the hospital side and TBM side, any color you can give there?</p>
          <p>And then just, last question just has to do with IDENTITY 1. Can you provide an update also on IDENTITY 2? And when do you think you'll have data available for presentation and how will you communicate the results from the IDENTITY Alzheimer's program with your gamma secretase? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The questions,  John &#x2013; we'll go ahead and have Derica respond to your guidance question and I'll probably take your formulary hospital question with Effient. And then Nick will respond for you on the IDENTITY 2 trial. Derica?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, John. John first of all, in regards to 2010, we'll provide more color on that at our December 10 analyst meeting. But let me at least provide some insight in terms of our outlook for the remainder of the year, as you've seen and stated we've revised our guidance on a pro forma non-GAAP basis to 4.30 to 4.40. Now within that, we still expect to be able to continue the solid volume-driven growth, revenue growth that we've seen for the first nine months of this year and that's the sustainable part of our business and so that's where we focus because with that, we get great leverage through the remainder of our operations, both in our manufacturing facilities in terms of full absorption, as well as getting the full return on our marketing and sales investments.</p>
          <p>With that, you also heard me speak about the effect of FX on our operating performance in terms of our financials. And, given where current FX rates are, I anticipate having a very significant cost impact to our cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. And as I stated this time last year, we had a significant benefit to cost of sales in the fourth quarter because the rates were going the other way. If you were to go back and look at history, you can basically track the impact of FX on our cost to goods sold line for the last three years. So, in the &#x2013; Q4 of 2007 was when we had a significant cost of sales due to FX in our gross margin.</p>
          <p>Last year, we had a significant benefit and now that rates are going the other way again, we're having another significant cost; we anticipate another significant cost and it pretty much tracks the dramatic movement in rates when you look at the dollar devaluation in '07, appreciation in Q4 of '08 and then devaluation again and now in Q4 of '09, we anticipate, so that would be our outlook for the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>I want to &#x2013; this is John Lechleiter. John, I want to just add that we've also got some planned manufacturing plant shutdowns in the fourth quarter. We're also going to be continuing robust investment in late-stage clinical trials for a number of assets in our pipeline, so these are things that also will factor into those fourth quarter results and are factored into the guidance adjustment we made today.</p>

          <p>And John, on Effient formulary access, we had a plan essentially that stretched over the first six months or so after approval for us to meet with the various hospitals, have their committees take their decisions and then grant the access that we expect that we will get. We are executing to that plan and things are proceeding according to plan. As was mentioned earlier, we're very pleased to add Express Scripts in both the managed care, commercial business and also in the part D plans. So again, we're executing to our plan, things are proceeding according to plan, but this is a process that will take a few months to play out. Nick?</p>

          <p>John, on the <mark type="inaudible" /> our small molecule for Alzheimer's, as we mentioned IDENTITY 1, the first Phase III trial is completed enrollment. On IDENTITY 2, we have enrolled over half of that study to date, of about 1100 subjects. We expect that study to report out in mid-2012, but keep in mind that this is run as a 21-month study. So, 21 months after completion of enrollment is when we'd expect that study to report.</p>

          <p>Yes, our next question comes from Catherine Arnold, Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering, John, if you could speak to your &#x2013; to two things, one is your recently announced cost saving program and your changes in development. Should we be thinking about the $1 billion in saving as sort of a starting point, given the significant reduction in cost structure for the industry overall and Lilly obviously playing a role in that and also the outlook for the company in terms of some of the products that are going off patent? Could you just frame how we should be thinking about that initial announcement?</p>
          <p>And then you had made some pretty dramatic comments about the organizational changes in the Development Center of Excellence, and I wondered, as we're sitting in your analyst's meeting and we're talking to you over the next course of the year, what kind of metrics will you be sharing with us in terms of us knowing whether or not that was a successful initiative and how that's progressing over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Catherine. I think, right now all we have to say on our plans for cost cutting is what we said on September 14, that we aim to take $1 billion out by the end of '11 and we expect that in concert with this, we'll need to reduce the number of positions at Lilly from a little over 40,000 today down to 35,000, excluding significant strategic sales additions in certain emerging markets and in Japan.</p>
          <p>Obviously Catherine, we're going guided by events as they unfold, as we bring molecules forward through Phase III in anticipation of launches in those out years, we want to make sure we have the right investment behind those products. So I think this is going to be an unfolding story as we move along.</p>
          <p>With respect to changes in development, I think there's a couple of things you should expect, I think you should expect that we can more or less consistently adhere to timelines and target dates. Obviously, this is a business with a lot of risks, there are acts of man and acts of God and sometimes the acts of God set you back, but you've still got to figure out how to recover from those and we've done that historically.</p>
          <p>I think you should also expect to see accelerated timelines. I've got my 30th anniversary with Lilly in two weeks' time, and it's still a 10 to 15 year journey, just like it was in the late 1970's, to move a molecule from the lab to patients. We don't believe that has to be accepted as gospel. We believe that we can apply new tools and new technologies in a more robust fashion, in a more consistent fashion, in order to reduce that cycle time and also to reduce, hopefully, cost and risk along the way. We're looking at tailoring strategies even before we enter the clinic. The opportunity therefore to study early &#x2013; drugs and early stage development in population groups that may be more enriched with people who are more likely to respond.</p>
          <p>You've seen the benefit of tailoring with our ALIMTA sales this month, or this quarter &#x2013; 47% increase and actually the ALIMTA target population today is smaller in terms of the broad lung cancer population than it was when we launched, because we're only indicated today for treatment of other than squamous-cell-type lung cancer. But that data that we have, the benefit for patients in that population, is so clear that it is obviously prompting physicians to choose ALIMTA for those patients who stand to benefit the most.</p>
          <p>So, those are some thoughts on that, you can expect that we will be quite upfront with the kinds of metrics that we think will be, and should be, indicative of progress.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine, Steve Paul here. Let me just elaborate just briefly and we will spend a bit more time on this in December at the analyst meeting. But there are three pillars to this Development Center of Excellence. One is a new operating system that we call Critical Chain, which as John indicates now, has us really operating on time with virtually every project where we've adapted the Critical Chain methodology and we'll be talking about that. We want to increase that to 100% of our projects.</p>
          <p>John mentioned tailored therapies in the stratification piece which is so important for our oncology pipeline. And the third one is something we call advanced analytics, which includes clinical trial simulation modeling which has really helped us not have to repeat trials, which is a major source of timeline delays, as well as adaptive seamless designs, like we've done with GLP-Fc, where you can literally prevent having any downtime between either Phase I and II, or in many cases Phase II and Phase III, and those are going to speed innovation to patients.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you. I have two questions, first on Effient. On the second quarter call, Lilly stated that you expected rapid formulary access across the board, that you expected things to move very quickly and that you expected Effient to perform extremely well where indicated. And now you're saying you expect it to build over time, six months was mentioned, it seems like there's been a change although you're saying it's performing according to plan, so I wonder if you could reconcile that &#x2013; those groups of statements?</p>
          <p>And secondly, Lilly only periodically updates its 2007 through '11 EPS guidance of low double-digit on the earnings line. Is that guidance intact at this time and given the very strong performance thus far in 2009, is there any reason for us not to assume it will be reiterated or even increased at the December analyst meeting? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Steve, thanks for the questions. In terms of Effient, as I mentioned before, we are tracking to the plans that we have for having the scheduled meetings with the various hospitals and with the decisions that, to date, have been favorable on granting that formulary access. For the 2007 to 2011 guidance, you're right, that is something that we do update typically once a year at the December analyst meeting. And with one exception recently, that was when we had the ImClone acquisition, that was significant enough we decided to update that guidance off-cycle. Derica, you want to-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Steve this is Derica. Let me say this, we're not going to update our guidance out to 2011 to date. In fact, I commented even on our '010 outlook and the fact that we will be sharing that at our December meeting on December 10.</p>
          <p>What I can say is that at least a commitment that we've made and how we performed up to this point in time. So if you look at our Q3 results, we generated 22% bottom line growth. If you take out the effect of FX, we were at 11% growth, year-to-date without FX we're at 14% growth. So up until this point in time, which we are prepared to talk about, we are absolutely executing upon the expectations that we've set both internally in terms of our internal goals and what we've shared externally with our investment community.</p>
          <p>And so I feel very good about the performance of the Company, not only this quarter and this year, but actually how we performed over the last several years, which is when we began to talk about that double-digit outlook, bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other think I would highlight for you, Steve, is the 2007 to 2011 guidance that we had issued, we did mention in the past, included an expectation, which we have continued to see, of pricing pressures globally. It did not include, however, a specific estimate for any significant healthcare reform here in the U.S. So there'll be a number of pushes and pulls that would push that number up, pull it back down, that will go into our updated numbers we'll likely discuss in December, that is one that I would flag for you that was not contemplated in the prior guidance that we clearly need to begin to figure out how we best incorporate that going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Couple of questions. Just going back to guidance. So going to 2011, basically takes you right up to the edge of the patent cliff and I think the market is kind of showing you that they want to know what guidance is beyond 2011. And you have more and more companies that are starting to give guidance into that difficult period of patent expirations. I'm wondering when we can expect Lilly to give guidance beyond 2011?</p>
          <p>My second question is, earlier this year, on several different occasions, Lilly has disavowed doing any sort of big pharma mergers and I'm wondering if that's still the Company's view or if that could be the fallback option if your pipeline doesn't pan out over the next couple of years and as you approach that period of heavy patent expiries.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tim, this is Derica again. In regards to guidance and clearly as we look to meet on December 10, we will share more of our perspective on our outlook for that period and how we look to manage through that period. And in terms of '11 through '14, which we call our <mark type="inaudible" /> which is the period of patent expiry for Zyprexa and Cymbalta. And as you look at some of the actions that we've already taken, starting with John's announcements back in September, those are all things that are consistent with our strategies and plans to navigate through that difficult period and for the Company, both in terms of the cost savings, both in terms of the head count reductions. But more importantly &#x2013; and most importantly &#x2013; is our focus on speeding up the development of the molecules in our pipeline, okay?</p>
          <p>In regards to, I guess your last question, which was around M&amp;A, we are solely focused on our number one priority, which you heard Ronika state, which is progressing the assets in our pipeline. We feel very good about the 60 assets we have today in the clinical stage of development. They may not be there in time to recover immediately from the Zyprexa and Cymbalta hit, but clearly it provides us good growth prospects post those events, and that's where our central focus is at this time and it's not on large scale M&amp;A.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. John, two questions please. You've alluded &#x2013; or you've made statements about the $1 billion cuts from total operating expenses and when Catherine Arnold sort of alluded to her views around how you &#x2013; how committed you may be. The question really is, if 23 products are in Phase II, III today, your R&amp;D expenses are jumping quite heavily into that X-Y period, would you be committed to actually doing more than $1 billion, is that sort of a plan that's on the back burner?</p>
          <p>That's question one and then question two. Perhaps more for Steve and apologies for just picking out one program, but if we look at the GLP-1 program, the GLP-Fc, and we look back at the Phase II data and we see some issues with heart rate and we see some issues with diastolic pressure. I am just curious how you actually justify moving the product along. And I'd be interested in your thoughts, especially when John alluded to, there are failures due to acts of God and failures due to acts of man. And I'm wondering, could this be a failure due to act of man? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, I'll start off and talk about the cuts. Clearly, we want to take all the actions necessary to enable us to place the right resources and invest the right resources in the right places in R&amp;D. Part of the effort underway since our announcement in mid-September is a close look at everything that we have in development with an eye to being very clear within the Company. We talk about the single operating system on which assets represent the most significant opportunities and therefore should be considered and invested in as the highest priorities.</p>
          <p>We certainly have other channels and other venues including partnerships of various sorts that we can also use to share costs and risk associated with development of a set of molecules that we think frankly are the most exciting set of clinical assets we've ever had in our history.</p>
          <p>Again, I think we're very resolute on achieving the $1 billion target. At this point in time, I think if we were to go any deeper than that, that would have to be with all due consideration of all the other factors that weigh in, including our desire and the need to invest in this pipeline to make sure that we have a trajectory that augurs well for strong growth as we come out of this period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, let me comment on GLP-Fc. Just to begin, we're very, very excited about the GLP-1 mechanism for treating diabetes. There is no class of drugs that show this kind of glycemic control, weight loss, lack of hypoglycemia overall. And the clinical data on efficacy has been, has really been tremendous, and I include in this Exenatide Once Weekly and our own GLP-Fc.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to cardiovascular liability, let me &#x2013; rest assured, we are very knowledgeable about what we need to do with respect to cardiovascular liability. This drug does not produce at doses that are very therapeutic and very effective increases in blood pressure, okay. There are some small increases in heart rate, a couple of beats per minute. By the way, this may be a class effect for all GLP-1 like drugs. So we are very, very confident right now with the safety data we have. Now, we need more safety data as we develop the drug, but we're constantly monitoring the safety of all of our GLPs in development and feel that this is going to be a very important standard of care eventually for treating type 2 diabetes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, just to be precise, I think the data you may be mentioning was also mentioned post-ADA on a call by a physician. Actually, Phase I data that as Steve mentioned was sort of super- therapeutic doses of five milligrams for example, which is significantly higher than we have studied in the Phase II trial called GBCJ that we had presented this year at ADA and that as Steve mentioned, showed no increases in blood pressure.</p>

          <p>Bert, you're absolutely right. I think IL-17, the IL-17 antibody, the anti-BAFF and BLS antibody LA-294 are our IL-23 &#x2013; selective IL-23 antibody are among the most exciting assets that we have in the pipeline. As you know, we've established proof of concept with all of those molecules &#x2013; each of those molecules in the clinic and they're being pursued for multiple disease indications in the autoimmune area.</p>
          <p>So we're moving on them as quickly as we can. They'll likely &#x2013; there will be some launches likely and indications and there will be continued development. As you know, there's a lot, there are a lot of diseases where those molecules could be effective. And NERI is also continuing along. Don't know exactly the date that we have on NERI in terms of -</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Bert, in regards to the dividend, today, as you can look at our stock price, our yield is around 5.7%. I think that's a very healthy yield, but we've &#x2013; up to this point we've been able to sustain our dividend. In fact, we've actually increased our dividend over the last 40 years. So we understand that it's very important to a very large portion of our investor base. And today, we're generating the cash flows in support of that. So if you look at our payout ratio, it's also reasonable. So I feel good about where our dividend payout is at this moment. I think our dividend yield is too high, but primarily because I think our stock price is too low and undervalued at this state.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks guys. Couple of questions. With regards to the dividend. Would you consider cutting the dividend if you had the right acquisition in place? And when it comes to M&amp;A, is the priority to acquire additional late-stage pipeline assets or maybe incremental sales to offset the patent cliff in the Y-Z years? And the second question is with regards to the gross margin. Using the current FX rates you guys are talking about, what would you say is the year-over-year impact to gross margins resulting directly from currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me try to take those three. In regards to would we consider cutting the dividend, it's very difficult to sit here and speculate and play "what if." It really would depend on what's before us. But as I stated earlier, today, we feel very good about the current operations of the business. Our focus to date is on progressing our pipeline. We know we're going to take a hit with the loss of &#x2013; pending loss of Zyprexa and Cymbalta in our future. Those are known dates and events. The uncertainty in our business around is around our ability to prosecute and advance our pipeline. So that is our number one focus from an asset-allocation standpoint. Secondly, and so we believe we can do that and still sustain our dividend.</p>
          <p>In regards to what is the focus of our business development activities, also, as I stated earlier, it's really not out &#x2013; going to do the mega mergers. We are very active in the space of looking at molecular-type acquisitions, okay, molecules that we believe will complement or enhanced or add to our current pipeline And to date we've been I think quite successful with some of the arrangements that we've been able to negotiate with partners that we work very well with, such as Amylin.</p>
          <p>In regards to your third question around gross margin. If you look to date, we had I think in the fourth and &#x2013; excuse me, in the third quarter our gross margin increased by &#x2013; or expanded by 3.7 percentage points, okay. The majority of that was driven by the movement in FX rate, but it's two different directions and two different periods. In Q3 of '08, our gross margin benefited from FX &#x2013; excuse me, I said it the wrong &#x2013; in Q3 of 08 our gross margin was hurt by FX; in Q3 of 2009, it benefited. So that's what creates the full 3.7% expansion year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, just one last thing on that. Essentially, if you look at the FX impact on sales and on manufacturing expenses in the period, there really was not much of an impact. So it really is related to the foreign exchange impact on inventory sold in the period that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters. And that really drove essentially the full change of that 3.7% compared to last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just further clarification on the gross margin. So the guidance for full year 2009 would seem to imply a midpoint of fourth quarter earnings of 0.79 to $0.89; I believe the consensus is around 0.96. So that would imply a gross margin of around 77%. And I am just &#x2013; Derica, I don't want to focus on this too much. But after the second quarter, the guidance was to assume that &#x2013; we were to assume that gross margins would go back to a sort of normalized level. Can you help us to think about what a normalized gross margin is because the fourth quarter last year you benefited, you had a strong gross margin versus a weak gross margin in the third quarter. And I'm just getting confused. So if you could just help us to think about what a normalized gross margin should be as we revise our numbers for 2010. Thanks.</p>

It's difficult to say what's a normal gross margin because our ability to predict exchange rates &#x2013; foreign exchange rates is, as I think indicated by the movement over the last two years, is impossible. What we have provided in our guidance for the year and its implications for the fourth quarter is that based upon where rates are today, we would anticipate having a significant detriment or a negative impact to our cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter driven by rate.</p>
          <p>You have to go back and Jami the guidance I would give you is to go back and look at the movement over time okay. So you go back and look over the last probably mid-2007 and you will see the swings, but you'll also see the periods of stabilization as well. And I think you can get to kind of what a reasonable range would be. I'm walking a fine line here because we've never provided guidance around our gross margin in terms of an absolute. What we have said is where we see the movement being year-on-year as we progress forward.</p>

          <p>Jami, at the last quarter call, we had mentioned that we did expect for the second half gross margin to decrease compared to the second half of last year; that's still the case. We still expect for that to be true for the second half. As you're mentioning, clearly, that will be comprised of a significant benefit in terms of the gross margin percent in the third quarter and a reduction in the year-on-year gross margin percent in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Probably take one more caller and then pass it to John to wrap up the call for us. Operator, next caller?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just two quick questions, first on Erbitux. Would be interested to hear your thoughts on the CHMP negative opinion on the FLEX data we had earlier in July?</p>
          <p>And then second, can you elaborate a little bit more on the divisions created with the restructuring, specifically given the Company's historic strength in neuroscience and two-late stage Alzheimer's assets. I was interested in why you opted not to have a neuroscience kind of Center of Excellence. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thanks Chris. I'll go ahead and take your first question and have John comment on the second one. So with the CHMP opinion for the first line non-small-cell lung cancer, definitely understand that Merck KGaA is intent on appealing that decision. They're really in the driver's seat with having the relationship and the discussions with the regulators there. So they're probably best positioned to give you more color commentary on how they view that interaction. Clearly, from our observations, our comments and discussions with them, there's clearly a strong view that there is data that's supportive of a reconsideration of the CHMP's initial recommendations and Merck KGaA is intent on taking that out to make sure that we can have that heard fully and hopefully have that recommendation reversed to get approval of the product. John?</p>

          <p>Chris, let me make a comment on the way the choices we made around our business units. Clearly, neuroscience is the single biggest component within our single biggest, largest business unit which is our Established Markets business unit. Our choices of the business unit formation around diabetes and oncology are really driven by our surmising that we're going to be in these two businesses for many years to come. A third of our clinical stage portfolio today are molecules in the oncology area. And with our insulin and GLP platforms, I think it's a pretty safe bet that insulin is a long-term business opportunity for Lilly.</p>
          <p>We hope and believe that neuroscience can also be that opportunity. But that clearly depends on us being able to bring through the next generation of innovative products whether it's NERI-IV, the mGlu2/3 drug or either of the Alzheimer's assets. So we have the flexibility to make different choices down the road. We think the current arrangement is the best one.</p>

          <p>Thanks for all your questions. We're going to be &#x2013; Ronika, Nick and I available after the call to take additional questions you may have. Let me go ahead now and turn it over to John to close the call.</p>

          <p>Yeah, and I'd like to thank all of you for taking time this morning for this update on our Company. We appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly. Let me close by emphasizing a few key points.</p>
          <p>Our strong financial performance continued again in the third quarter as we delivered volume-driven revenue growth, operating income growth greater than revenue growth, robust EPS growth and strong operating cash flow. We remain confident that this type of financial performance provides the resources we need to strengthen our pipeline and drive future growth, to deal with the patent expirations coming in the next decade and to respond to a challenging healthcare environment.</p>
          <p>We took decisive action to reshape our operations, including announcing a new operating model that includes a Development Center of Excellence to accelerate clinical development and the reorganization of our pharmaceutical business into four business units.</p>
          <p>We communicated our plan to reduce our cost structure by $1 billion and lower our head count to 35,000 by the end of 2011. We offered a voluntary exit program to select areas of our U.S. sales force to facilitate implementation of a new commercial approach in 2010 and more recently agreed to sell our Tippecanoe Laboratories manufacturing site to an affiliate of Evonik Industries.</p>
          <p>We continue to stake our future on innovation, investing appropriately in R&amp;D, making timely database decisions to advance or terminate our assets. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress and seeing many of you in New York on December 10 for our annual investment community update. Have a great day.</p>
