          <p>Good evening, everybody, and welcome. Sorry to keep you waiting a few moments. So thank you for joining our presentation this evening on Jardine Matheson's 2011 results.</p>
          <p>To begin with, I'll give you an overview of performance before reviewing some of the major developments in the group during the year. And finally, I'll provide you my some of the outlook for 2012 and our Finance Director James Riley will provide a more detailed commentary and analysis of the results, including those of the individual companies and at the end we'll be delighted to take any questions.</p>
          <p>This shows the level of ownership at the JMH level together with the share of profit which we derive from each of our main operating companies. One of the main events of last year was the increase in our shareholding in Jardine Lloyd Thompson, JLT, by 10% as a result of the successful partial offer which we made that increased the group's interest on an accounting basis from 32% to 42%. The largest contributors, as you can see, to our underlying profit were Astra, Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land and Jardine Pacific.</p>
          <p>The year as a whole, the group's revenue including 100% of the associates rose 22% to US$57 billion. This reflected increased contributions from most of the businesses. The group's underlying pre-tax profit, which is of course also before minorities, increased by 13% to US$4.8 billion. And the underlying profit attributable to Jardine's shareholders, Jardine Matheson shareholders, increased 10% to US$1.5 billion and underlying earnings per share rose by 9% to US$4.13. Dividend per share will be up by 9% for the year to US$1.25.</p>
          <p>On a geographic basis, Greater China provided 40% of group profit, while Southeast Asia contributed 57%. The increasing share of Southeast Asia was primarily due to the excellent results from Astra. In fact, Indonesia accounted for 39% of group profit last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the contribution of the individual units, Jardine Pacific showed good growth, although results varied between individual operations. Jardine Motors performances in Southern China and the UK were somewhat disappointing, despite the operation in Hong Kong producing an excellent result. Jardine Lloyd Thompson had an encouraging year with some good increases in Asia and Latin America. Hongkong Land's residential earnings were held back by the timing of completions as we foresaw in our commentary at the end of last year, but its commercial property profits were somewhat better than had been expected.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm saw like-for-like sales growth in many of the operations with most of its major banners able to generate strong sales and profit increases. Mandarin Oriental experienced increased demand in most of its markets, which helped to offset the impacts of earnings in Tokyo where we went down resulting from the earthquake and tsunami and also some considerable pre-operating costs in Paris.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's operations outside Astra had a positive year, while Astra itself turned in the star result for the group. Its profit contributions to Jardine Matheson increased by 28% to US$561 million, reflecting an excellent performance by almost all its units.</p>
          <p>I'll leave my comments on the businesses there as James will say more in a moment and I'll move on to a brief overview of the key developments within the group during the year.</p>
          <p>In Jardine Pacific, Gammon won new contracts to maintain a very strong order book. JC has been active. It signed a deal just in the last few days for an acquisition in Singapore that'll expand its capabilities there. JOS took a significant step forward when it acquired a major distribution competitor SiS early last year and they had an excellent year together last year.</p>
          <p>Jardine Restaurant expanded with additional interests acquired in KFC and Pizza Hut in Vietnam. Jardine Motors completed the acquisition of a 22 dealership motor retailing group in the United Kingdom, further growing its position in that market. But its main focus in recent years has been growing the network &#x2013; its Mercedes Benz network in Southern China. The outlets there are all built to Mercedes' exacting standards and do require significant investment. Over the past year, we've opened seven more outlets and a further five are under development, which will bring the total to 29.</p>
          <p>Jardine Lloyd Thompson has continued to invest in growth through bolt-on acquisitions and through the recruitment of industry experts. Its business transformation program, which is nearing completion, also delivered increased earnings.</p>
          <p>Hongkong Land's office and retail properties in Hong Kong produced strong results, and its growing Singapore portfolio made an increased contribution. This improvement was however offset by lower profit as I mentioned a moment ago from the residential business due to the timing of completions and that led to a reduced underlying profit for Hongkong Land overall for last year. Several new development sites were secured during the year, including a prime commercial site in Wangfujing in Beijing, residential sites in Chongqing and Singapore, and also some sites in Cambodia.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farms' core expansion strategy is organic growth, supplemented by selective acquisitions. In the more mature markets of Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, Dairy Farm is investing in technology that will improve operational efficiencies and in refurbishing stores to enhance their attractiveness to our customers. While in Indonesia and Malaysia significant funds are being used to grow the network of existing formats. The Dairy Farm group is also making acquisitions, the latest being a majority stake in a Cambodian supermarket chain.</p>
          <p>Our restaurant associate, Maxim's, made an excellent contribution based on the strong like-for-like sales increases despite facing higher food and wage costs. Maxim's continues to introduce new concepts into Hong Kong while growing its cake shops and restaurants in Guangdong. Increased demand led to improvements in most of Mandarin Oriental's key markets and its results also benefited from branding fees arising following the sale of the Residences in the project adjacent to our London Hotel. The group's development activities continue with a new hotel in Guangzhou scheduled to open in late 2012 followed by Taipei, Milan and Shanghai in 2013.</p>
          <p>Astra enjoyed another extraordinary year. To enable Astra's motor manufacturing operations to meet the strong increasing demand there, Astra is now investing in new capacity for both its motor car and motor cycle production with new factories under construction both for Astra Daihatsu and Astra Honda. At the same time, its sales and service network is being expanded steadily. Astra has also stepped up its investment in infrastructure with US$400 million commitment to a greenfield toll road. Once again therefore, 2011 has been an active year for the group characterized by organic growth, bolt-on acquisitions and further investment in group company shares.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd like to give you my thoughts on the outlook as we move into 2012 economies round the world continue to present an uncertain picture. As Europe struggles with its debt problems, demand has weakened, affecting exports from Asia and while prospects are somewhat brighter in the U.S.A they are well short of a robust recovery. In China there are suggestions that economic performance is starting to soften and though we're generally confident that reasonable growth will be maintained some sectors like residential property will probably remain under pressure. Nevertheless taken in the round prospects for most of our markets will remain pretty good, pretty fair and as I explained the group is in excellent financial shape.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen as you know at the end of this month I should be handing over my executive responsibilities to Ben Keswick as Managing Director, Adam Keswick as Deputy Managing Director. I'm sure that under their leadership Jardines will continue to grow and prosper.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand you over to our able Finance Director, James Riley and I'll be happy to answer any questions at the end. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Anthony. I will now go over in little more depth the financial results for the group beginning with my usual remainder, the group uses underlying profit attributable to shareholders as its key earnings performance measure and to keep things simple I'll refer to this as underlying profit. This measure excludes non-trading items which we identify and explain separately in order to provide a clear understanding of the ongoing business performance of the group. You should also note that any dollar figures mentioned will be U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Non-trading items for the year totaled US$1954 million, these included US$1901 million gain on the revaluation of investment properties in Hong Kong Land as well as US$23 million gain on other investment properties. The other non-trading items are all relatively small in amount but I've broken them out here for your ease of reference.</p>
          <p>The group's balance sheet strengthened over the year with total equity rising 23% to US$39.3 billion and shareholders funds rising 19% to US$16.4 billion. These increases were essentially attributable to the group's retained net profit and the revaluation uplift on the group's investment properties. The group continues to benefit from robust operating cash flows, ample committed facilities and access to the capital markets. This has provided a sound financial base on which to support continued investments in maintaining and expanding the market leading positions of our major businesses.</p>
          <p>The cash inflow from operating activities for the year was US$2.7 billion this represented an increase of US$464 million on 2010 principally due to higher operating profits. Capital expenditure for the year before disposals amounted to US$3 billion. This figure includes all the items included under investing activities in the group's cash flow statement the most significant components of it being the purchase of tangible assets, the biggest segment of which is in Astra and in particular in United Tractors. The acquisition of a number of new subsidiaries, the additional shares acquired in Jardine Lloyd Thompson during the year, the purchase of leasehold land interest in various businesses which are treated as intangibles and advances to a variety of associates and joint ventures. In addition to this figure of US$3 billion, US$526 million was spent on acquiring additional shares in group subsidiaries during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>The consolidated net debt at the end of 2011, excluding financial services companies, was US$2.4 billion representing gearing of 6%, which compares to US$2.3 billion at the end of 2010 and gearing of 7%. The group also had net borrowings of US$3.5 billion in its financial services companies, which comprised primarily the automotive finance businesses within Astra. This increased from US$2.4 billion at the beginning of the year, an increase that was in line with the underlying trading levels in our automotive businesses. The borrowings in these businesses are closely termed to match with the tenor and currencies of the debtors that they finance.</p>
          <p>Focusing on the group debt, excluding the financial services companies, I've broken this down by business unit here. You can see that the principal borrowing vehicle within the group is Hong Kong Land. Jardine Matheson Corporate had a net debt of US$130 million at the end of 2011, down from US$290 million a year prior. Jardine's Strategic's corporate net cash position fell from US$297 million to US$250 million over the same period. At Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, the dividends received from Astra net of withholding tax essentially flowed threw into the Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage dividend, and thus the net cash rose from US$7 million to US$29 million.</p>
          <p>I'll now move to the individual businesses. Jardine Pacific's underlying profit rose 15% to US$179 million in 2011. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals recorded a 3% decline in its contribution to Jardine Pacific earnings. Underlying this is a 6% reduction in the cargo throughput at of HACTL which resulted in a 17% fall in its earnings. This fall was offset by the increase in the proportion of HACTL's earnings that we have been recognizing since Jardine Pacific took its interest in HACTL up from 25% to 42% in May, 2010.</p>
          <p>Jardine Schindler generated improved profits from both new installations and its maintenance portfolio. Whilst the Hong Kong operation continued to expand more than 50% of the operating profits of this business are now achieved in the other markets of the region.</p>
          <p>Jardine Restaurants Pizza Hut operations in Hong Kong and Taiwan achieved modest growth in both sales and profits whilst KFC's Taiwan operating performance was flat. However, the KFC franchise in Taiwan which was acquired in 2010 was able to recognize a deferred tax gain of US$5 million during the year.</p>
          <p>JEC achieved a good increase in profit as its joint ventures and operations in Thailand and the Philippines performed well. Like Jardine Schindler JEC's operation outside Hong Kong now produces somewhat more than 50% of its earnings. JOS recorded strong revenue and earnings growth with an excellent first year's contribution from the SiS business acquired in January 2011.</p>
          <p>Gammon's earnings were maintained despite absorbing losses from two difficult projects and its order books remains high at US$3.0 billion as it continues to win large projects.</p>
          <p>Aviation services maintained its profit, but Jardine Shipping Services only recorded a break-even result following a decline in freight rates and volumes in a very difficult environment for the shipping sector. Jardine Motors recorded an underlying profit of US$61 million in 2011, a reduction of 29% due to the challenging conditions in the United Kingdom and in Mainland China.</p>
          <p>The 2010 comparative included a gain of US$6 million from dealership property disposals in the United Kingdom. Zung Fu produced an excellent performance in Hong Kong and Macau where it sold a record number of cars. In Mainland China, while Zung Fu sales have grown well, we suffered margin erosion on locally produced cars which led to a significant reduction in earnings.</p>
          <p>The group's dealerships in the United Kingdom continue to face weak demand with declining new vehicle sales and lower margins. Jardine Lloyd Thomson delivered a strong financial performance amidst challenging economic conditions, which included lackluster GDP growth in mature markets under soft insurance rating environment. The 13% increase in profits was driven by strong organic growth of 7%. The increasing realization of the benefits of JLT's continued recruitment of leading industry professionals, carefully selected bolt-on acquisitions and its increasing exposure to high growth economies.</p>
          <p>Looking into the component parts of the business, the risk and insurance group which comprises JLT's worldwide retail operations and its specialists mainly London based insurance, wholesale and reinsurance working businesses reduced growth of 11% in revenue and 8% in underlying trading profit. Within this the strongest growth came from its Asian and Latin American activities. The employee benefits business also had a successful year with trading profits up 20%.</p>
          <p>That completes my review of the businesses held directly under Jardine Matheson. I'll now turn to Jardine Strategic which achieved underlying profits of US$1.6 billion, an increase of 10% with underlying earnings per share also up 10% at US$2.55. The net asset value per share shown for Jardine Strategic is calculated by reference to the market value of the underlying investments held by Jardine Strategic and at the 31 of December this was up 2% at US$48.36 per share. So Jardine Strategic dividend will be increased by 7% to US$0.022.5 per share.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the main listed companies under Jardine Strategic, Hong Kong Land's underlying profit decreased by 13% to US$703 million and underlying earnings per share were 16% lower at US$30.29. Taking into account the increase in the value of its investment properties Hongkong Land's net asset value per share increased by 22% to US$10.58 per share. Its dividend of US$0.16 has been maintained at the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong Land's commercial property interest produced a better than expected result as they benefited from a good market in Hong Kong and stable conditions in Singapore. In Hong Kong, its office vacancies stood at 2% at the year end and its luxury retail portfolio was fully let. In Singapore the group benefited from a first full year's rental income from the Marina Bay Financial Centre joint venture. A third tower in the project, which will complete this year, is some 65% pre-let. In Beijing, an iconic site has being secured in Wangfujing, which will be developed as a premier retail center with offices and a Mandarin Oriental Hotel. In Cambodia, a property portfolio has been acquired that includes two future development sites in Phnom Penh.</p>
          <p>In the residential business, one project was completed in Singapore, compared with three in 2010, and three new projects were successfully launched for sale, enabling a US$44 million reversal of previous impairment provisions. There were also contributions from developments in Hong Kong and Macau. In Mainland China, development profits were earned in Beijing and Chongqing, where an additional premium site was secured in December.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm experienced another good year in 2011. It produced a 15% increase in sales, while underlying net profits rose 16% to US$474 million. Favorable exchange movements enhanced both sales and profit by around 4%. The group had net cash of US$466 million at the year end. Mannings health and beauty stores produced another excellent result in Hong Kong, while IKEA traded well in both Hong Kong and Taiwan. A good result from East Asia benefited from another fine contribution from the Guardian health and beauty chain in Malaysia and particularly pleasing performances from hypermarkets and supermarkets in Indonesia. Restaurant associate Maxim's made an excellent contribution based on strong improvements in like-for-like sales despite facing increases in both food and wage costs.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm is seeking to expand its operations through acquisitions, and in February 2012 agreed to acquire a 70% equity interest in a small supermarket chain in Cambodia. It is also continuing to invest in the development of its business with the modernization and standardization of retail processes and systems, the improvement of its supply chain management and the expansion of its offering of private label products.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental reported underlying earnings up from US$44 million in 2010, US$59 million in 2011. The net asset value per share adjusted to include leasehold properties at fair market value rose 16% to US$2.70 per share and net debt reduced to US$113 million which decreased gearing from 6% to 4%.</p>
          <p>In Asia the group's hotels in Hong Kong and Singapore traded well. But Bangkok was affected by the Thai floods and Tokyo suffered low occupancy for a number of months following the earthquake and tsunami. In Europe, there were particularly strong performances in London and Munich, while Mandarin Oriental, Paris opened in June to considerable acclaim.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, business levels improved across the portfolio although the rate of earnings growth was lower than in the group's other regions.</p>
          <p>Now moving to our Singapore base holding company, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage. It produced another excellent result in 2011 with an underlying profit up 25% at US$1.019 billion. Astra's contribution to the underlying profit of Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage was up 27% to US$1.011 billion benefiting in part from a stronger rupiah on translation. The contribution from the group's other motor interests excluding Astra rose 10% to US$62 million. The results from Singapore improved reflecting the strength of the Mercedes Benz brand at a time when government quotas reduced the size of the market.</p>
          <p>Tunas Ridean had a good year as it benefited from the strong consumer demand in Indonesia. In Malaysia, however, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang's earnings were flat in the face of intense competition. In Vietnam, while Truong Hai Auto Corporation achieved 26% increase in unit sales, its profit was lower due to reduced margins as well as higher finance and operating costs.</p>
          <p>Astra enjoyed a record year in 2011 producing an underlying profit of US$2.0 billion and the contribution to Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage as I have said of just over US$1 billion. All its main divisions contributed to this impressive result. Its progress was supported by growth in the Indonesian economy but benefited from increased domestic demand, high commodity prices and the availability of financing at attractive interest rates, reflecting the country's enhanced global credit standing.</p>
          <p>Profits from Astra's automotive businesses grew by 18%. Astra's motor vehicle sales rose by 13% to 483,000 units, representing a market share of 54%. Astra Honda Motor's motorcycle sales improved by 25% to 4.3 million units with its market share increased to 53%. There was a 24% improvement in the contribution from Astra's consumer finance operations reflecting loan book growth in line with the rise in the group's automotive sales.</p>
          <p>Insurance company Asuransi Astra Buana benefited from higher premiums, while Astra's joint venture Bank Permata reported net income rising 15% as loan book growth offset slightly lower net interest margins.</p>
          <p>United Tractors, its 59% owned subsidiary, sold a record 8,467 units of Komatsu heavy equipment, while its coal mining contractor Pama increased its coal production by 11% to 87 million tons. United Tractors also sold 4.5 million tons of coal produced from its own mines and acquired a further five concessions. Astra Agro Lestari reported earnings up 19% as palm oil production rose 14% and prices were 8% higher. There was some improvement in the contribution from infrastructure and logistics as well as from its information technology activity.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I should now touch on the other investments held by Jardine Strategic. Rothschilds Continuation in which Jardine Strategic holds a 21% interest is the holding company of the Rothschild financial advisory group. In common with most financial institutions, the company has continued to face challenging markets during 2011. Despite this, it has maintained its market share and is well positioned in the areas of financial advisory, wealth management and merchant banking. ACLEDA Bank of Cambodia in which Jardine Strategic holds a 12% stake achieved a record profit in 2011. Similarly, Asia Commercial Bank which is 7% held performed creditably as Vietnam faced up to the challenge of restoring balanced growth while containing inflation.</p>
          <p>In India, Tata Power's large generation projects are progressing to completion while its business is benefiting from stable Indian utility earnings and increasing returns from its Indonesian coal investments. Jardine Strategic has a 3% investment.</p>
          <p>That completes my run through of the group's results.</p>
