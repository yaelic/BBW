          <p>Good morning everyone.  This is Denis Morozov, CEO of Norilsk Nickel and I'm here today with Oleg Lobanov, Deputy CEO, Chief Financial Officer of our company, [Ralph] Tav Morgan, Deputy CEO, responsible for production and strategy, and Dmitry Usanov, Head of Investor Relations.  Thank you for joining us today for this discussion of our 2007 financial results.  Before we begin please refer to the press release, presentation and financial statements which were released today on our website which is www.nornik.ru.</p>
          <p>Today after my introduction part of the call, there is brief overview of our recent achievements. Oleg Lobanov will provide a little more details on the latest financial performance in 2007. And after that we will conclude with a Q&amp;A session.  I should say that 2007 was successful and a difficult year at the same time.  On the one hand the market was very favorable and commodity prices were higher for almost all the metals produced by Norilsk Nickel.</p>
          <p>Acquisition of OM Group's Nickel Business and LionOre Mining International in 2007 contributed the needed sales increase.  As a result, the financial performance for 2007 was the best in Norilsk Group's history.  Reported sales for the year amounted to USD 17 billion which is 44% more than in 2006.  EBITDA for 2007 hit the historical record rising by 31% up to more than USD 10 billion.  Profit from operations before non-cash write-offs grew in 2007 up to USD 7.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Taken into account the good interim financial results for 2007, we continue the practice of interim dividend distribution.  Interim dividends for nine months of 2007 amounted to 108 rubles or USD 4.4 for each ordinary share and were paid in February 2008.  Based on the record financial and operating results for 2007, the Board of Directors recommends approving final dividends for 2007 at the General Shareholders Meeting on the 30th of June 2008 of 220 rubles or USD 9.3 for each ordinary share which is almost USD 2 billion in total.</p>
          <p>Our shareholders will receive considerable income from appreciation of the shares price of our company as well.  Thus, the company's market capitalization in 2007 hit a record of USD 63.5 billion growing almost twice during the reporting period.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, 2007 was a year when significant changes in shareholder structure were initiated.  It is obvious that a divergence of interest between the two largest shareholders could not be very beneficial for the company.  As a result, the non-core energy assets spin-off that might have created and added significant value for our shareholders did not take place.  Because of this process we now have a new strategic shareholder which is United Company Rusal. Acquisition of a 25% interest is another confirmation of Norilsk Nickel's attractiveness for the investment community and the good prospects for further growth of metals business.</p>
          <p>Let me show you that my risk management team is totally dedicated to further development of our business for the benefit of all our shareholders.  At this stage, let me turn it over to Oleg Lobanov who will take you through our financial results for 2007. And after that, as I mentioned, we will have a time for Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the conference call of Norilsk Nickel dedicated to the IFRS results for 2007.  I will provide you with some additional comments about the process of preparing our financial statement and the major events that influenced our financials.</p>
          <p>In 2007 several significant acquisitions, significant for Russian market took place.  First of all in first quarter of 2007, we acquired several nickel assets from the OM Group and these assets consist of Harjavalta plant and Cawse mining operations in Australia.  Then we in several tranches acquired control in the energy company, OGK-3. And then in the end of June 2007, we've made significant acquisition of the LionOre Mining Company. And all the three acquisitions are reflected in full detail in our financial statements for 2007.</p>
          <p>For reflecting these transactions in our financial statements, we've invited an independent valuation company.  This time it was Ernst &amp; Young.  They performed their valuation and valuation process consisted of fair value of assets determination, identification of goodwill as a difference between consideration and fair value of asset. And as it is requested by standards, we performed impairment tests for all three acquired companies as of reporting date 31st of December 2007.</p>
          <p>Actually, in all three cases, methodology was different because for OM Group assets goodwill had negative value and it wasn't impaired at all.  For OGK-3, we viewed the matter based on market value depreciation because it provided higher value and goodwill impairment of OGK-3 of USD 754 million was based on market value depreciation of the company.</p>
          <p>And for LionOre assets, they have a more complex situation because goodwill was identified. Then, it was allocated to cash generating units for each plant and mine of the LionOre. And after that, we've made impairment tests separately for every cash generating units. And the biggest influence to this exercise was provided by the decision of postponing the realization of Activox project on BMR Plant in Botswana. And as a result, several transactions were recognized in our financial statement. First of all, this was 325 of goodwill impairment in the same line as OGK-3, and then it was a separate line in -- as a financial expenses showing depreciation of mineral rights of Tati and Nkomati mines because during valuation process, we was expected a higher recovery rate from these mines and after postponing the Activox project, we returned back to the initial current recovery rate. And this was reflected in depreciation of these two mines.</p>
          <p>Coming back to general financial statements, I can say that -- say revenues from sales for 2007 grew in total 44%. 38% gain from sales of metal production and significant increase came from other sales arising from consolidation of OGK-3 and reflecting in our financial statements, sales and services that never reflected before.</p>
          <p>This growth in sales coming from a very favorable situation of the market.  We enjoyed 55% growth of average sale price for nickel, ten and 15% growth for sales of palladium and platinum, respectively.</p>
          <p>Talking about cost of sales, we can say that the significant influence for this figure was provided by changing our consolidation base. That's why in our analysis, we provided separate comparison of last year and current year performance separately from Russian assets and influence of acquired international assets because the total amount is not comparable.</p>
          <p>Talking about Russian assets, the cost of sales grew by 17% and this came from growth of cash production cost by 27%, a significant increase of sales of -- by products by 39% and these we can say &#x2013; we can attribute mainly to significant growth of price for cobalt and rhodium and some decrease of stock of metals.</p>
          <p>After consolidation these are acquired international assets, total growth of cost of sales was 49%.  In cash &#x2013; taking separately cash operating costs, we can say that major factor of growth also was change of consolidation base. But analyzing separately Russian assets is a growth of total cash production cost was 24% of which the most significant impact came from the growth in salary and wages that gave 38% growth. And operating our international assets, total growth was 46%.  Some, most growth was provided operations of our acquired assets of processing nickel concentrate on Harjavalta the given amount USD 478 million and processing of PGM scrap that was performed by Stillwater Mining Company. And this figure grew significantly in 2007 because of price growth for PGM and increase in volume of operations.</p>
          <p>Also, as you are aware, there was significant growth, inflationary growth, of almost all components of operating costs like repairment services, utilities, and all items that are dependent on sale price of metals.</p>
          <p>Looking at the dynamics of cash cost per unit of produced metals, we can say that according to the methodology used by the auditors and corresponding to the best practice in metal industry, the most significant growth of cost of production per ton came to nickel because of the most significant price growth of nickel.  And in reverse, they gave favorable effect of the cost of production per ton of copper and per ounce of platinum and palladium.</p>
          <p>The price &#x2013; the cash cost per unit of nickel grew by 31% for our Norilsk operations, 35% for Kola operations.  In the same time, cost of production of PGMs decreased by 2 and 7% in Norilsk by 14 and 19% on Kola and grew by 4 and 8% in Stillwater Mining Company.</p>
          <p>Other non-production costs also grew in 2007. Financial expenses grew by 36% and biggest impact provided custom duties, transportation and not significant growth of insurance.  SG&amp;A cost grew by 61% and again, one of the most important factors was changes in consolidation base aiding our international assets and OGK-3.</p>
          <p>Looking at our dividend policy and the distribution of 25% of net profit, management of the company analyzed the best practices in mining and metals industry and discovered that it's quite usual to use as a dividend distribution base, net profit adjusted for extraordinary events including impairment of assets.  That's why this year taking into account our significant write-offs arising from impairment of goodwill of two significant acquisitions in 2007, we recommended to the Board of Directors to use as a -- for dividend calculation net profit adjusted for impairment of goodwill. Throughout this &#x2013; we recommended to pay for 2007 USD 1.8 billion as a 25% of net profit adjusted for impairment that gives us USD 7.2 billion.  So, we've recommended to pay final dividends of 220 Rubles per share and taking into account interim dividends of 1.8 Rubles gives additional payments of 112 Rubles per share.</p>
          <p>Thank you for attention and we are ready to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.  We have a question from Jason Fairclough from Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Just a couple of quick questions related to these write downs.  Could you speak a little bit about how management's assessment of the value in both LionOre and OGK-3 has changed?  Perhaps you could discuss how much of these USD 2 billion in write-downs is management driven and how much of it is your auditors basically forcing you to write these assets down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Oleg Lobanov speaking.  So, actually we had no contradictions with our auditors and our opinion of goodwill impairment was a common opinion.  So, we cannot say any difference in our point of views.  The situation is, as I told in my presentation, different for the OGK-3 and LionOre.  For -- with OGK-3 we understand that the main purpose of appreciation of OGK-3 was further spin-off of energy assets.  We were disappointed by the decision of our shareholders to postpone or push forward on this operation.  That's why for us it was a technical aspect of consolidation, and reflecting these energy assets on our balance sheet.  And from our point of view the applied approach of reflecting market devaluation of this asset was correct, fair and reflects the situation.  Actually, we are waiting for the decision being taken, and after that we expect that this problem will be resolved on a separate balance of a spun-off company.</p>
          <p>Talking about LionOre assets, the situation consists of -- this impairment consists of two phases, so first of all, the situation before decision of Activox postponing and after. Before that, the decision was discussed and taking in the period from end of May to first of June, it was long time for decision making. And it was very serious decision.  The situation with impairment of LionOre assets was quite normal, so we've analyzed synergies and its expected economic effect and its current value for the date of acquisition.  We've analyzed the situation at the reporting date.  We've made the impairment step and we saw that under circumstances that we expect that the date of acquisition and information provided to us at the reporting date, the situation was quite normal and the consideration paid for the assets was totally recoverable. And we expect no impairment at all.</p>
          <p>Then after the decision was made, we have to make some significant changes. Despite, we're still pretty sure in economic reasons behind Activox technology. And we plan to use it and if necessary talk more. Then, we provide these additional more technical information. But from formal point of view of impairment testing, we have to reflect this decision in our financial statement, partly because we are publishing our accounts in the beginning of June and this decision made almost in the middle of 2008, nevertheless, changed assumptions used in impairment tests as the reporting date and we had to reflect these changes.  So, I think I answered your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to be clear then for the LionOre write-down, this is 100% being driven by the cancellation of the Activox project? It's just hard for me to understand that there was so much value in that project which itself wasn't a particularly big one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, this is Tav speaking with regards to the write-down, just to remind you about the project itself, Tati Nickel which is a mine and concentrate producer who has been in operation quite a number of years and has been processing its concentrates through the BCL Smelter or other &#x2013; selling to third parties.  The decision to move ahead with the Activox project was based on the expectation that the capital costs associated with the construction of the Activox plant would justify themselves based on the additional recoveries from nickel being the difference between the recoveries at the Activox plant versus an alternative processing group.</p>
          <p>At the time the decision was taken to proceed, those capital costs were justified.  The subsequent increase in capital costs associated with the project, together with some of the other constraints that we faced, including the expectation that at the time of commissioning and ramp up of the plant, there would be problems in terms of power provision, brought us the decision to suspend indefinitely the project.</p>
          <p>The value that was attributed to the project was based on evaluation at the end of 2007 as Oleg pointed out.  And as he mentioned, at that time there was none expected that there would be any impairments at all.  However, as we observed during the first quarter of the first part of this year, the increase in capital costs associated with the project as well as the other problems I spoke about, we took a decision to suspend the project. And that's what resulted in the difference.  So the differential that you see in the impairment, in fact what reflects the expected value associated with the project, had we gone ahead at the expected capital costs at the time of the initial approval of the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does the lower spot nickel price that's prevailing at the moment, does that figure into the write-down at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the evaluation was done as of -- remember the -- just to go into how the evaluations are done, evaluation is done at the time of the purchase of the assets and then at the end of the accounting period.  In this case for the LionOre assets, they were purchased as of June 28, 2007 and the end of the accounting period was 31st of December 2007.  That evaluation was performed at the management's expectations of prices prevailing at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible that we could actually see another write-down on this asset if the nickel price continues to trade lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the sensitivity of the value of the assets is quite high. And if we will see that decrease in consensus of pricing, in future we will provide impairment tests for LionOre assets every year. And if this process will be continuous some write-offs are probable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If there will be a reverse situation, for example, when we will finalize our exploration and CPR reports for ores of Australia and African assets.  And we will see increased amount of proved and probable reserves and we ended -- for example, if prices will grow then we will see much higher carrying value of these assets. But because, according to the IS standards, goodwill is not recoverable so, and this version is not &#x2013; this operation is not reversible.  So, we will say that our value of assets is like it is reflected in financial statements, but we will not impair it further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The next question comes from Sergey Donskoy from Troika Dialog.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, gentlemen.  A few questions from me. First a follow-up on the Activox issue.  Could you just give some idea of what was the escalation in CapEx costs in percentage terms versus your original plans?  And also do you also see any significant increase in operating costs that could motivate this write-down?  And also on Activox, do you believe there are any reasons to think that Activox may be more economical in some other regions, in Russia, in Australia, compared to Africa?  That's a first area.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on operating costs I noticed in your accounting significant increase in wages, in labor costs, in -- as in expenses about 90% growth year-on-year which cannot be solely attributed to consolidation of international operations.  The question is what was the reason for that?  And also more broadly could you provide any guidance or your thoughts on what cost dynamics we're going to see this year, what cost pressures you're currently facing in Russia and Africa?</p>
          <p>And lastly could you also provide some guidance for '08 CapEx for Russia and for international operations separately?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergey, this is Tav.  Let me try to answer your first part of the question in regards to the operating costs and CapEx <mark type="inaudible" />.  With regard to the, with regards to the Activox project, one of the things that we did up on acquisition of the &#x2013; of LionOre was to take a look at the project. We conducted a full review of the Activox project taking into account also the opportunities for alternative options associated with it.  Therefore, I can say simply that the capital cost increase is roughly in line with those that we're witnessing in other, let's say, capital projects worldwide.  However, there were a number of different options that we looked at in terms of the technical configuration and also the size of the plant, and plant utilization depending on the sourcing of nickel concentrate.</p>
          <p>So, simply, at this point, I can say that some of those options of course, we would in the future continue to look at, although we've suspended the project at this point in time.  With regard to the operating cost, the operating costs of the existing operation, Tati Nickel, again there's no effect as such on the operating cost of that operation, because it continues to produce the nickel concentrate that's either sold to third parties or smelted through the BCL smelter.</p>
          <p>With regard to Activox the third party question, where do we see the applicability? We have been, since the time that we acquired the technology, been looking at its applicability in other sulfide operations.  One of the things to remember about applying it to an existing, let's say, brown field operation is that the capital cost associated with that, the construction of the Activox plant, and potentially also, let's say, a refining unit with it, those capital costs need to, need to be justified based on the increased recoveries from the existing operation.</p>
          <p>So, of course, when we look at brown field operations, we have to take that into account, with regards to any green field operations by using Activox technology on new deposits and so forth.  The capital costs would be different in the sense that you'd building, let's say, a mine and concentrating Activox operation against the full nickel recovery from mine, on through to, let's say, to refine metal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to address the question about wages and labor costs in our operating expenses.  So, first of all, I would like to make slight corrections that 92% growth, it's -- reflects only sale -- salary growth in administration part of expenses, and the base of these salaries USD 435 million in 2007.  And this is not the most important part of the expenses. And we have to reconcile that the attribution of this and that salary and wages to operational part to CapEx part and to SG&amp;A part is quite -- have some soft borders.  And the major part of the salary expenses reason, cash operating costs, and the base is much higher. It's USD 1.550 billion in 2007 consolidated for the Group.</p>
          <p>The rate of growth is 38% for Russian assets, and 46% total in the Group.  The main reason for the Russian salary growth is, I can say there are two factors, but they are connected.  First of all, we have to analyze and monitor the situation in regions where our production is situated. And we do this analysis and we see that when salary grew in budget area, the other population living in the area where our production assets are situated, we have to respond because neglecting these social trends will provide some undesirable complications.</p>
          <p>Second, we know that overall in Russia, we observe a significant industrial growth and the migration of our work force and staff turnover increased significantly during last year. And we have to reply correspondingly and to try to protect our most qualified and experienced part of the staff.  And after analyzing the situation, we made the decision to increase significantly salaries from 1st of July last year. And we still continue to monitor the situation and we understand that this will be a very significant -- easy for us in nearest term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The next question comes from  Zak Flecchion from UBS.  Please go ahead.  Thank you.  The next question is coming -- sorry, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Zak Flecchion from UBS.  A couple of questions, I think you actually didn't answer the previous question on CapEx and I also have this question in mind.  Can you please give us the guidance for your CapEx for this year and the trend for the next year if possible? And then I will ask the next question after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can take that question.  We expect CapEx during 2008 across the Group to be somewhere between, let's say, 1.6 to 1.9 billion with just over 1 billion related to the metals and mining, our core assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And do we -- should we expect the salary increase in 2009 or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are currently reviewing our CapEx plans and as part of our &#x2013; preparing our business plans for the coming year. And when those are approved by the Board of Directors we will make them public.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  Then regarding your debt, you disclosed that just over 3 billion is due to be repaid this year. What's your strategy?  What's your view on this -- whether you are refinancing a portion or whether you're repaying, what should we expect to see in the debt servicing this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, at the moment we've accumulated significant cash amount on our balance sheet.  It's at the moment more than USD 5 billion and we are working on syndication for USD 1.5 billion through refinance bridge loan obtained in June last year to finance acquisition of LionOre.  So our strategy is quite complex and combined.  In general, we are looking at our capital structure and we are trying to reach optimized value of cost of capital. And we analyze situation on the markets and when we are trying to get the most effective results combining our loans, existing loans, loan facilities and different instruments providing us with interest income.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you have currently or at the year end, you had cash exceeding your debt by 50% and you're still borrowing.  So does it mean that you will be acquiring assets, acquiring companies later on and you are looking at M&amp;A opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer at the moment only that far.  So, you are not completely right, because if you will add together long term and short term portions of our debt, we will have a gross debt of &#x2013; by the end of the year approximately USD 8 billion. And it is the same at the moment, and we have the cash additional for slightly more than USD 4 billion. So our net debt at year end was 4 billion, now it's slightly lower because we accumulated some cash for paying back our debts due mid-summer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I was actually comparing it to the debt due this year, not the total debt number.  So if you have to pay back 3 billion and you said you have 5 billion on you balance sheet then you're still borrowing on 1.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, can you just repeat your question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to understand the strategy in terms of managing your financing profile.  You reported that you had a  -- let me just give you the precise number, USD 3.9 billion of debt due to be repaid in 2008, as of December 2007.  And on the -- looking at your balance sheet you have USD 4 billion, slightly more than USD 4 billion of cash. And the question was what's the approach, whether you are going to be repaying all of the debts that are due this year using your funds from operations or are you going to be refinancing a portion of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not going to repay our debt before schedule.  We are -- we have intention to follow strictly to the schedule agreed when we are paying the debt.  And the main reason why we are accumulating cash on our balance sheet is that we are -- we have several strategic decision to be taken quite soon.  I can say I borrow then, or just spin off.  I can say about Udokan copper deposit and several others and taking in, having in mind a difficult situation on financial markets and difficulties that were softer to discussing and negotiating both new debt finance on the market.  We keep some flexibility and have cash reserves on our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And talking about cash, can you please explain to me the difference between the bank deposits that are mentioned in the note 32 of your financial statements under cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits that are mentioned in the note 27 under other financial assets, please?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think not to waste your time I can say that most probably the difference is that these are term deposits and coal deposits. So some of them can be taken and used immediately, some of them have to be kept on to some limit of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the thing is that the deposits that I mentioned on the note 27, you take them through cash flow, you meant, you take them as a cash outflow which in my view shouldn't be the case. If it's your money in the bank, then it is something different that you should be explaining to us?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Denis Morozov, I will take some of the question.  So as you are aware, at the end of April this year United Company Rusal became our shareholder.  So, we haven't been approached by Rusal for any negotiation discussing a potential combination of our companies.  Although Rusal management at the beginning ultimate goal is just 25% stake acquisition of Norilsk Nickel as a full merger or combination of two companies together.</p>
          <p>So, according to the Board's decision which was taken about two weeks ago, we approached Rusal ourselves to enter into negotiations, to sign confidentiality agreement. But we don't have any feedback from Rusal by now, and basically Rusal is a question formation of that company is, has to provide according to the provisions of corporate class configuration basically comply to this regulation providing formation to have company Rusal which you have to provide according to the current Russian regulations, and in the meantime basically waiting for their response towards our approach.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The next question comes from Vladimir Zhukov from Lehman Brothers.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.  I think I have two strategic questions for you guys.  The first one is related to -- if you managed to identify any synergies between the recently acquired international assets, mainly Harjavalta refinery and LionOre, and your existing portfolio of Russian assets?  And part of the reason why I am asking this question is that you said earlier, please refer why you wrote-off some of the goodwill associated with acquisition of LionOre, because apparently you given that kind of -- manage to find the synergies you are hoping for?  That's first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question comes -- in relation to the whole situation with &#x2013; involving Metalloinvest and Rusal because you earlier decided to postpone or call-off negotiating -- merge negotiations with Metalloinvest while simultaneously one of your largest shareholders in Russia decided to just to confirm that they have -- they do have an interest in Metalloinvest merger.  And now you are saying that you actually are trying to approach Rusal with a similar sort of a merger proposal. That is more that you kind of prefer to go ahead or consider in more detail the merger with Rusal and Metalloinvest.  And also, what is your view on the potential three-party merger?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'll take the first question with regard to the synergies -- just to remind you again, we had two acquisitions last year, the first was OM Group's Nickel Business and the second being LionOre.  The integration objectives in the first period of time with these two assets was to actually integrate them together into Norilsk International.  There are quite a number of synergies that have been achieved, in particular in bringing together the predominantly nickel concentrate operations of LionOre with the nickel refining operations of OMGs Nickel business.  And last year we had record production at the Harjavalta plant in Finland, and in large part that was due to our ability to draw on concentrates from LionOre's operations.  In fact, in December we had record production for the month at the stated operating capacity is 50,000 tons per year.</p>
          <p>With regards to on the technology side, of course there were and still are expected synergies from the application of the Activox technology to nickel sulfide deposits, be they abroad or in Russia.  In pursing the applicability of the technology to these ores and deposits, we have taken the decision to move forward with setting up a laboratory at our Gipronickel facility in St. Petersburg to do bench testing of ores.  We also are now examining the possibility of doing a test run, bolt test run of Kola ores through the demonstration plant in Botswana.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Dense Media Separation Units, which we continue to build, and we will complete construction later this year on at Tati Nickel for upgrading nickel and ore before initiation, that's also being examined as a potential application in the Kola Peninsula to improve the recoveries from our Kola ores.</p>
          <p>And finally, I should say that on the technology side, we are close now to moving the nickel concentrate that we prepared in <mark type="inaudible" /> for testing at the Harjavalta plant moving it from Russia to Harjavalta for an industrial test that we plan to conduct later this year.  In order to see what the improved recoveries would be from our traditional parametallurgical routes versus the sulfate leech technology that we have at Harjavalta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Denis Morozov. I'll work the second question, I'll answer the second question.  So just to follow, I want to correct you because we did not decide to postpone negotiation with Metalloinvest. That was Metalloinvest's decision.  And they notified us they actually want to stop the process, because they'd like to consider an IPO, so we basically ready for negotiations because we completed GGO and preliminary relation with Metalloinvest.  So that's why basically the other party decided to do it, and basically had to postpone these negotiations as well.</p>
          <p>On the Rusal side, we approached Rusal because Rusal made public statements with ultimate goal of 25% stake acquisition in Norilsk as a full combination of two entities. Rusal right now have a basically advantage being our shareholder to request information and to gather additional information on Norilsk Nickel. So that's why we approached Rusal negotiation of any potential combination of our entities in order to get access to the information.</p>
          <p>So that's why Rusal has not replied yet.  As a public company, we are ready to any combination to any discussion. But we believe that just for Norilsk Nickel should be a consolidation platform today because we are a public company compared to Metalloinvest or Rusal and we are ready to review any potential combination from our companies and our shareholders' point of view.  Thank you</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi it's Michael Kavanagh here.  Just a question on possibility for further write-downs of OGK-3, given the fact that the share prices continue to fall.  And then secondly, if we can maybe get some idea of the potential growth profile out of Norilsk Nickel.  I know that you give production guidance through to for 2008, but perhaps something beyond 2008 particularly in the context of the postponement or indefinite postponement of Activox technology in Botswana.  As I understand, a lot of the growth in Australia was predicated on taking Activox technology to Australia, as well.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From technical point of view, the impairment test is performed once per year the reporting date, but I expect some initiatives from the auditors to reflect the market revaluation at each reporting date and when we will report our six months result, most probably, we will show the asset at the current market value.  So, if the market price of OGK-3 will continue to fall, we will reflect further write-offs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, this is Tav.  With regard to the production profile going forward, you are right to point out that we have a forecast for this year of about 300, 305,000 tons, which is an aggressive, ambitious forecast that we intend to pursue.  With regard to the impact of the decision we have taken in regard to Activox, we are currently assessing how that impacts the profile of expected production in 2009 and beyond, not only in Africa, but also in Australian operations, because since the acquisitions we've taken a number of decisions that are different from the implicit strategies of the two companies from which we purchased those assets.</p>
          <p>We will be as part of the business planning process that's ongoing and will result in and adopt a budget later this year.  I give a forecast for 2009 and beyond which is reviewed as a result of the fact that before 2007 when we were strictly a Russian operation with our operations in Russia.  So, that forecast will be coming later this year with regard to the production profile going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dave Kozminich from Renaissance Capital.  Are you able to separately quantify the contribution to EBITDA from LionOre and OMG this year? And also could you give us a likely contribution for '08 for these entities?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The question is from the LionOre and OMG, are you able to separately quantify the contribution to EBITDA from this year? And also for next year, can you separate and say how much of the EBITDA contribution will come from those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Tav. Our intention, of course, in acquiring both businesses was to combine them. That was logic or rationale behind them.  We treat them now as one unit. Last year we created Norilsk International and given the fact that the end products from the operations are essentially two types, one is the finished product that comes out of Harjavalta as well as some intermediates which we still currently sell to third-parties, but intend to process in the future within our operation.  We're not releasing, we don't plan to release separate information for the two acquisitions.  It's one business unit in the company, today and will continue so forward.  With regard to 2008, no we haven't provided any forecast of EBITDA from the separation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, another one I wanted to ask you, first of all you mentioned the escalation in costs in the past year and I wanted to ask you what your outlook is for your operating costs in the coming year and what are the main factors affecting them?  And also your outlook for the markets for your metals and what's the absolute expectation for the company as a result of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is concerning the outlook for the markets for your products.  What is the outlook for the markets for nickel and other metals and what implications with the market dynamics -- for your company in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Oleg Lobanov.  I would like to answer the first part.  So, we anticipate in future that we will be able to tighten cost control and be in line with inflation rate, like we've managed for the last five years. But of course if some extraordinary events like significant growth in salary level in Russia as a whole country, so we'll continue &#x2013; we will be forced to reply by some adequate measures.  All other events are under our control and we expect it to be quite effective.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  With regard to the market, I'll just briefly comment.  Obviously we've seen the nickel price come-off a bit in the past month or so.  However, we expect that the stainless steel production in China, which is a major driver for consumption, to grow in 2008.  There is, as a result of the price in the market, some pressure on the nickel pig iron production which has been the stop gap for the lack of supply.  We would expect that the market to move back in the balance in 2009.</p>
          <p>In regard to the other I'd say metals are important in our portfolio, platinum. We saw supply fall in 2007 and supply continues to remain tightly constrained there and should suffer for a number years particularly given the power constraints and that are being felt in Southern Africa.  With regard to palladium, the palladium was in fundamental, palladium market was fundamental adjusted in 2007, demand for palladium is growing quite well. And the auto catalyst sector continues to do well in terms of jewelry.  In regard to all the other products that we produce in our diverse portfolio we've seen strongly improved prices over the last couple of years. And for the most part we're expecting that to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now I'll ask another additional question on the subject of potential mergers and acquisitions.  As you have mentioned Norilsk Nickel Group is a publicly listed company, in contrast to Russian Aluminum or Metalloinvest.  I wanted to ask you whether any type of deals with those companies in terms of merging these assets are conditional on Rusal outperforming in IPO and conditional on Metalloinvest, could you give me an idea as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was -- If I understand your question correctly you asked whether any combination or potential combination between our companies is conditional on an IPO buy of Rusal and Metalloinvest, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would answer it simply and here I reemphasize what Dmitri Usanov said. Management's view is that in the rapidly consolidating metals and mining sector, the public interest in Norilsk Nickel is large <mark type="inaudible" /> which to affect any combinations. We can't comment as to the plans of other companies regarding their IPOs. In principle they are not necessarily conditional. It is possible for a public company to acquire a private company.</p>

The Talvivaara site is under construction with expected production starting in later this year.  The material that will come from Talvivaara is meant to be processed at the Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta. The -- Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta participated in the research that went into the project and obviously we'll be working closely together with them to achieve output from the metal produced from their mine.  We have a stake in the company, which we acquired as part of the OM acquisition.  I'm not prepared to discuss what we plan to do further.</p>

          <p>Hi it's Michael Kavanagh again.  I had a follow-up question on the segmental analysis.  I see that you have not disclosed a separate segment Norilsk Nickel International. Would it not be a good idea to do that seeing as that's the way you look at your business now?</p>
