          <p>Good morning. My name is Sarah and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners second quarter 2011 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Burkhalter, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners joint conference call to discuss second quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO and Enterprise's General Partner; followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bryan Bulawa, Senior Vice President and Treasurer for the General Partner of Enterprise. Randy Fowler, who normally covers the financial discussion and DEP, is out ill today. There are also other members of our senior management team in attendance.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management of both Enterprise and Duncan. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>Before we get started this morning, I would like to also remind everyone that the purpose of this call is to discuss second quarter results. And therefore we will not discuss the proposed EPD/DEP merger or entertain any questions regarding that proposed merger.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy.</p>
          <p>We're pleased to report new records this quarter for net income, adjusted EBITDA, gross operating margin, and distributable cash flow supported by growth in natural gas, NGL, and crude oil production in the shale regions and improved NGL sales margins. We surpassed the records we set last quarter, as our diversified and integrated midstream assets continued to perform well and we continued to benefit from increased demand for NGLs by the U.S. petrochemical and international markets.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the quarter increased 14% to a record $923 million from $809 million in the second quarter of 2010. This led to record adjusted EBITDA of $916 million and record net income of $449 million.</p>
          <p>Our partnership generated record distributable cash flow of $778 million for the quarter, which provided 1.6 times coverage of the increased cash distribution of $0.605 declared with respect to the second quarter. Included in distributable cash flow this quarter was $166 million of net process from the sale of 4.45 million energy transfer equity common units. Excluding these proceeds, our distribution coverage was still 1.2 times.</p>
          <p>We retained $284 million of distributable cash flow this quarter. And through the first six months of this year, we've retained $491 million, or roughly a third of the $1.5 billion of distributable cash flow we generated. This retained cash is being used to fund our growth capital projects and reduce our dependence on the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Our NGL pipelines and services segment reported gross operating margin of $498 million, an increase of $57 million or 13% over the second quarter of last year. Our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business benefited from continued strong demand for NGLs as higher NGL sales margins and fee based gas processing revenues led to a $35 million increase in gross operating margin. We also had a significant increase in fee based gas processing volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale and our Rocky Mountain plants.</p>
          <p>Equity NGL production was lower this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to two weeks of downtime this quarter at the Pioneer gas processing plant for maintenance and modifications to improve ethane recoveries. Fee based gas processing volumes increased 24% to 3.7 billion cubic feet a day in the second quarter of this year, compared to 3 billion cubic feet a day in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for our NGL pipelines and storage business increased to $143 million this quarter, a $4 million improvement over the second quarter of last year, primarily due to increased long-haul movement at higher tariff rates and lower operating expenses on the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines systems, which reported a $10 million increase in gross operating margin.</p>
          <p>Total NGL pipeline volumes increased 3% to 2.3 million barrels per day this quarter. We exported 10 million barrels of propane during the quarter, which is 18% higher than in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>We've successfully concluded an open season during the quarter for the expansion of the Rocky Mountain leg of our Mid-America pipeline system.</p>
          <p>Shippers executed 10-year shipper paid transportation agreements for an initial commitment of 38,500 barrels a day capacity. Capacity commitments have increased to 50,000 barrels a day, and shippers have until end of the year to exercise options to further increase their commitments to 85,000 barrels a day. We expect that will happen given the significant interest in new NGL takeaway capacity out of the Rockies. We hope to receive FERC approval of the project this month and expect it to begin service in the third quarter of 2014.</p>
          <p>Our NGL fractionation business reported record growth operating margin at $52 million, a 52% increase over the $34 million reported in the second quarter of last year. This increase was largely attributable to our new frac-4 unit at Mont Belvieu, which began commercial operations during the fourth quarter of last year and is operating in excess of its main play capacity of 35,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Construction continues on our fifth fractionator at Mont Belvieu, which is on schedule to begin operations by the end of the year. And in June we began construction on our sixth fractionator at Mont Belvieu to accommodate the expected growth of liquids-rich natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale. When this new facility is completed, Enterprise will have more than 450,000 barrels a day of gross NGL fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu and 940,000 barrels a day of gross NGL fractionation capacity system-wide.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services segment had a $54 million or 51% increase in gross operating margin this quarter. Approximately $32 million of the increase was from three systems: the Texas Intrastate system which benefited from higher firm capacity reservation fees and volumes; the State Line Gathering System, which we acquired in May 2010; and the San Juan Gathering System that had higher volumes and fee-based revenues.</p>
          <p>Natural gas marketing had a $27 million improvement, due primarily to changes in the market value of certain derivative contracts and higher margins realized on physical contracts. Total onshore natural gas pipeline volumes increased 4% to 11.9 trillion Btu per day for the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the progress of the Acadian Haynesville extension pipeline, which is on schedule to begin flowing volumes in late September, with demand charges expected to begin October 1. And Jim will talk a little bit more about the Haynesville extension in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines and Services segment increased 161% to $68 million for the second quarter of 2011 from $26 million for the second quarter of 2010. We had increased throughput on all of our onshore crude oil pipelines except for Seaway, which continues to be impacted by the lack of demand for northbound transportation to the oversupplied Cushing Hub.</p>
          <p>Increased drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale led to higher volumes on our South Texas system, while increased production in the Barnett Shale benefited our Red River gathering system. Crude oil marketing margins improved significantly over the second quarter of last year due to more favorable crude differentials contango market opportunities and the integration of pipeline expansion projects.</p>
          <p>Excluding $10 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter of last year, our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment had a $19 million decrease in gross operating margin, due in large part in the slowdown in permitting for exploration and development activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Naturally occurring production declines have not been offset by new drilling.</p>
          <p>Our Independence Hub platform and Independence Trail pipeline reported an $8 million decrease in gross operating margin on a 25% reduction in volumes. We expect to receive additional volumes into the Independence and Cameron Highway pipelines in the fourth quarter of this year associated with initial production from a new well and the restart of other wells that were down for recompletion or facility maintenance.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the Petrochemical and Refined Product Services segment was $140 million this quarter compared to $158 million for the same quarter of last year. The propylene fractionation business had a $36 million decline from the second quarter of 2010, which was far and away one of Propylene's best quarters ever, due to lower sales volumes and sales margins. Propylene fractionation volumes were 13% lower this quarter due to refinery turnarounds and planned maintenance activities as well as new supply entering the market.</p>
          <p>The Refined Product Pipeline business had a $9 million decrease in gross operating margin, primarily due to higher maintenance in pipeline integrity expenses as well as lower transportation volumes from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest and Northeast markets.</p>
          <p>Pipeline volumes for the refined products pipelines were 11% lower this quarter. Structural shifts in population and refinery production at PADD 2 have led to a decline in demand for transportation of refined products in the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. According to EIA, overall demand for refined products at PADD 2 dropped by 5% from 2008 levels. We view this as primarily a result of the lingering effects of the recession, conservation, and shifts in population.</p>
          <p>Additionally, several significant refinery expansions are beginning to come online that are benefiting from cheaper West Texas Intermediate crude prices, leading to an increase in refined products production in the Midwest.</p>
          <p>Our Octane Enhancement business reported a $26 million increase in gross operating margins to a record $37 million in the second quarter of this year, largely due to higher margins, increased volumes, and contributions from the high purity isobutylene plant that we acquired out of bankruptcy in November 2010.</p>
          <p>We recently announced an increase in our quarterly cash distribution to $0.605 per unit or $2.42 on an annualized basis. This is a 5.2% increase over the distribution declared with respect to the second quarter of 2010. This is our 28th consecutive quarterly distribution increase and our 37th increase since our IPO in July of 1998.</p>
          <p>We're proud of the strong results our businesses produced this quarter and our employees who made it happen. With the continued development of shale and other non-conventional plays around our assets, the growing demand for NGLs versus crude oil derivative feedstocks for our petrochemical customers and the wide crude oil price differentials between Cushing and the U.S. Gulf Coast, we have clear visibility to our growth drivers for the next two years.</p>
          <p>We currently have about $6 billion of major growth capital projects under construction that will begin coming online later this year and continue through 2014. These new assets will deliver important services for our customers as well as generate new sources of distributable cash flow for our partners. We remain excited about the opportunities available to the partnership as well as our future prospects.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike.</p>
          <p>As you can tell from our results that Mike has just gone over, market fundamentals continue to support midstream margins, and investments in this segment are racing to keep pace with upstream and downstream announcements. Expansions range from new drilling and growing upstream production for natural gas, NGLs, and oil; midstream processing, fractionation, storage, and transportation; and interestingly, downstream chemical plant expansion.</p>
          <p>Led by shale gas and shale oil, we're in a period of tremendous growth in the entire midstream sector. Benchmarks by which we always measured industry performance in the past are now in uncharted territory. At the start of this year, crackers consumed record volumes of ethane, topping 1 million barrels a day. In May, U.S. producers saw record high NGL production volumes from natural gas that exceeded 2.2 million barrels a day.</p>
          <p>In April, U.S. LPG export volumes reached an all-time high of over 5 million barrels. In May, unplanned cracker outages tightened the ethylene markets considerably, boosting olefin prices and cracker margins to historically high levels despite operating rates only dipping into the upper 80%s and low 90%s. And then by the end of June, cracker operators were above 95% operating rates, with supplies balanced by opportunistic exports.</p>
          <p>Margin is driving this behavior for producers and consumers alike. Ethane prices, for example, are low enough that cracker operators have all but maxed out consumption of this feedstock, which not only topped 1 million barrels a day at the start of the year, but also topped the 1 million barrel a day mark last month.  On the flip side, NGL prices are also high enough that producers continue to maximize drilling in NGL-rich plays.</p>
          <p>Propane exports from the U.S. has been an another area of tremendous growth, with the same production fundamentals driving propane extraction at natural gas processing plants to a record high 620,000 barrels a day in May. On the demand side, propane into crackers as well as propane dehydrogenation has increased, but the largest increase has been seen in exports, where of course we have an expansion underway. As with ethane, propane is affordable enough for chemical plants to post solid margins from propane, but attractive in international markets, and at the same time provides U.S. producers with attractive upstream margins.</p>
          <p>Projects like the expansion of our Rocky Mountain segment that Mike mentioned, the expansion of our propylene fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu, and our sixth frac train that is expected be online in early 2013, we continue to pursue projects that meet customer needs but also complement our existing assets. As an example, we're in the process of implementing projects we have previously announced. First, our Acadian Haynesville extension, our 270-mile pipeline project continues to make rapid progress. We expect to begin testing the pipeline in just a few days, with first flows in September and full commissioning about October 1.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe our Haynesville assets are in the premier area of the play, De Soto, Sabine, and Red River parishes, as evidenced by the rig counts, were 67 of 121 of all Haynesville rigs were in close proximity to our footprint.</p>
          <p>The Haynesville Shale continues to be one of the most prolific natural gas plays in the country, with 6 Bcf a day of production from 1,600 wells. Our analysis indicated about 250 wells that have been drilled and are either waiting on completion or pipeline connections, and that the Haynesville could ultimately produce 10 Bcf a day when fully developed. Our pipeline project is supported by long-term 10-year commitments, and has a multitude of interconnects and integrates well with our existing natural gas assets in Louisiana.</p>
          <p>We're also nearing completion of two new gathering and treating systems totaling 140 miles of pipeline that will integrate with our State Line gathering and treating system. These systems expand our gathering footprint to cover 500,000 acres of the core at the Haynesville and Bossier Shale trends in Red River, De Soto, Sabine, and Natchitoches parishes. Those gathering systems have the capability of delivering approximately 1 Bcf a day into the Haynesville extension.</p>
          <p>In our Eagle Ford developments, the implementation of several significant projects is in full swing and proceeding. In addition to the numerous bridge and expansion projects already completed along our network of natural gas and processing assets in South Texas, several large gas and crude projects are progressing rapidly: 300 miles of rich and lean large diameter natural gas pipelines, 600 million cubic foot a day cryogenic gas processing plant, and we are already in the planning stage to expand that by another 300 million a day; a 127-mile NGL pipeline to take products to Mont Belvieu; a 75,000 barrel a day NGL fractionation coming on at the end of the year our fifth train; and as Mike mentioned, our sixth train, 75,000 barrels a day, due on in the first quarter of 2013; 220 miles of crude oil pipelines, including our Phase 2 extension further into South Texas near Gardendale; and over 5 million barrels of storage capacity reaching from South Texas, including the Houston area, terminating at our new ECHO [Enterprise Crude Houston] terminal in Houston that will have connectivity to every Houston area refinery and barge access to the entire Gulf Coast. This pipeline will also have access to Cushing for our Seaway pipeline.</p>
          <p>The Eagle Ford continues to exceed expectations relative to drilling, production, and reserve projections in both the rich gas and crude oil areas. There are currently about 180 rigs working in the Eagle Ford, about 1,100 producing wells, and about 400 wells waiting on completion of crude and natural gas pipelines and gas processing. All of our existing natural gas pipelines and gas processing fluid facilities are chock-a-block full, and we're running over 125 crude oil trucks in order to keep up with the needs of our producer customers. It continues to be an exciting story that's already having a very meaningful impact on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>We're going to shift gears a little bit now and speak to some of the projects that we are pursuing. We remain hopeful that our crude oil pipeline from Cushing to Houston continues to gain traction. Given the magnitude of the economics, our timeline attributes, and the synergies of our Cushing storage and the connectivity of our new Houston ECHO storage and terminal, we continue to push the project.</p>
          <p>We have a number of producers highly supportive, very highly supportive of this project; and given the upside potential of the threshold we require is not a fully subscribed pipeline. We're not there yet, but are determined to continue to push forward to the accretive threshold we need and if achieved will sanction that project.</p>
          <p>The recent string of downstream petrochemical announcements calling for significant expansions to domestic ethylene production and growing production and reserve projections for the Marcellus and the Utica, it has become more and more apparent that Marcellus ethane producers need Gulf Coast chemical companies. And those chemical companies on the Gulf Coast need more</p>
          <p>Marcellus ethane. We have a pretty exciting project to bring this Marcellus ethane to the heart of the U.S. chemical hub in Mont Belvieu. And our discussions with shippers continue to advance and are gaining a lot of traction as with the Cushing-Houston pipeline, the upside of this project makes us comfortable with a commitment threshold that's not fully subscribed but is accretive.</p>
          <p>In addition and finally, we have a separate but very complementary project we are discussing with Gulf Coast petrochemical producers that would provide an extensive ethane header system that would literally stretch 550 miles from Corpus Christi to the Mississippi River. This impressive project can be accomplished by utilizing existing pipe and adding a modest amount of new pipe. Our Marcellus project would connect into this new header, allowing Marcellus ethane to flow throughout the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>If we are successful with this project, chemical plants across the entire Gulf Coast could literally float their ethane needs on our header system, giving them access to growing ethane supplies all the way from the Rockies, including the growing Uinta and D-J [Denver-Julesburg] basins and growing rich gas supplies from the Permian to the Eagle Ford into the Marcellus. This project would be back by a 100 million barrel NGL storage facility in Mont Belvieu. With connectivity from Corpus Christi to the Mississippi River supported by our fractionation storage and interconnectivity at Mont Belvieu, Enterprise would be able to provide services that give consumers flexibility and resource diversity and producers unparallel flow assurance and market choices.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Randy &#x2013; to Bryan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. I would like to take a few minutes and discuss additional income items, first starting with general and administrative costs.</p>
          <p>Our G&amp;A costs were $50 million in the second quarter of 2011, which was $10 million higher than the G&amp;A costs in the second of 2010, primarily due to increased employee expenses and costs associated with the pending merger with DEP.</p>
          <p>Moving to interest expense, interest expense increased to $188 million this quarter from $179 million reported for the second quarter last year. Average debt balances were $14.2 billion and $13 billion for the second quarters of 2011 and 2010 respectively. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense was $12 million with mark-to-market expense associated with interest rates swaps assumed in the DEP merger.</p>
          <p>Partially offsetting the increase in interest expense this quarter was higher capitalized interest. Capitalized interest this quarter was $26 million versus $11 million for the second quarter of 2010. For 2011, we estimate that capitalized interest will increase to approximately $100 million to $110 million from $47 million recorded in 2010 due to increased levels of construction activity.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures were $1 billion this quarter, which included $916 million for growth projects. Approximately 84% of the growth capital expenditures this quarter were for the Haynesville and Eagle Ford related projects.</p>
          <p>Through the first half of the year, we have spent $1.6 billion on growth capital projects. And for the year, we expect to invest approximately $3.7 billion in growth capital, primarily for our Haynesville and Eagle Ford projects. Currently, we have a cumulative investment of approximately $2.3 billion on major growth capital projects not yet completed. In the four quarter of this year, approximately $1.4 billion of this will roll off as we bring the Haynesville extension pipeline into service.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenses were $84 million this quarter and $137 million for the first six months. We still expect to spend approximately $250 million to $260 million for sustaining capital expenditures this year.</p>
          <p>Moving to capitalization, adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2011 was $3.4 billion. As a reminder, we define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA less equity earnings plus actual distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is transparent. What you see is what you get, with approximately 99.4% of our total debt being on the face of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt principal to adjusted EBITDA was 3.92 times for the 12 months ended June 30, 2011 after adjusting for the 50% equity treatment of the hybrids. Our floating interest rate exposure is approximately 13% of the total debt portfolio. The average debt life was 10 years using the first call date for the hybrids. And our effective average cost of debt was 5.5%.</p>
          <p>At June 30, 2011, we had consolidated liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion, which included availability under the EPD's and DEP's credit facilities as well as unrestricted cash. Later today, EPD will launch the formal syndication of a $3.25 billion, five-year bank credit facility. We've already received $3.2 billion of written commitments from our largest banks for this new facility. This facility will replace EPD's existing $1.75 billion credit facility, which matures in the fourth quarter of 2012. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our banker. They have been a strong and consistent supporter of our partnership.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Duncan Energy Partners, this quarter DEP had $33.8 million of distributable cash flow, which provided 1.26 times coverage of the $0.46 per unit cash distribution that will be paid tomorrow, August 10, to unit holders of record on July 29. Cash flow from fee-based assets enabled us to increase the cash distribution to our partners for the 11th consecutive quarter. DEP had total liquidity of approximately $394 million at June 30, 2011, including availability under its revolving credit facility and cash.</p>
          <p>With that, Randy, we're ready for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your untrucked crude oil business, can you give a little more color on the gross operating margin bump given the volume decline and talk a little bit more about the marketing contribution to the segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Mark Hurley. We had both good results on both the transportation side and the marketing side, mainly around the shale plays in South Texas and West Texas. And so all of those volumes were up, and really volumes were only down on the Seaway. Elsewhere on the system, we've hit record volumes on all of our pipelines. The marketing side was helped due to the fact that pricing was supported by very strained logistics in the systems as well as strong demand for the crude coming out of those markets along the Gulf Coast.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect those fundamentals to continue for the rest of the year? This is a very high performing quarter for the onshore crude oil business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will continue to be a strong business environment for the rest of the year. We had some contango opportunities in the second quarter. Those really aren't there now, but I do think overall the business climate will be pretty strong.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Okay. I appreciate the color on the Cushing-Houston pipeline project. Can you give us a little more detail as to discussions with shippers on this project?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final question from me is incremental cash flow should be quite strong from the Eagle Ford and Haynesville projects. What are your thoughts looking out for 2012 on distribution growth? Are you still leaning towards running very high coverage, or is there a chance you could see a little bit higher bump in the distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are two things here. One is that we continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest in new projects. And to the extent we can retain some of that cash flow for reinvestment it lightens our need to go back to the capital markets. Second, if you look at the second quarter, our distribution coverage excluding the sales of those ETE units was 1.2 times. So as we've said before, we look at it every year and every quarter. What is our excess distributable cash flow? What is our need for capital for our growth projects? And we determine our distribution based on that. But I wouldn't expect any dramatic changes in what we've been doing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So on the project you guys mentioned to take ethane from the Marcellus down to the Gulf Coast, do you have any thoughts about &#x2013; there has been a vague, cryptic announcement from Shell about a potential cracker up there. And there has been a discussion of backhauling some of that stuff to Sarnia as well as a project which is currently going through an open season. Do you guys, looking at the size of the market up there, have a feel for how big could that market get? Could it be 150,000 barrels a day of ethane? And do you think there's enough room for all these projects, or do things have to start getting bumped?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim. We think there's room for those projects. We think that the project at Sarnia probably has to go. It's only about 40,000 barrels a day. We think the opportunity is north of 150,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And as far as the propane exports, you guys mentioned year-over-year volumes. Have those trended upwards quarter over quarter, or have you hit the ceiling in terms of capacity on the Houston Ship Channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We pretty well hit the ceiling on what we're capable of loading, which is why we've got an expansion underway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just one last question, and this is hitting on what Bryan hit on. As far as the crude segment, I realize that there is a high premium being paid for trucking services, especially in West Texas and the Eagle Ford. But can you guys just roughly break out how much of the performance in crude comes from gathering pipelines versus pipeline alternatives like trucks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't get down to that level of detail, but I would tell you that the reason that we're doing it in trucks is because we're building pipelines that will ultimately go and service and take that capacity. So whether you're picking it up in trucks or you're doing it through a pipeline and benefiting from downstream storage, I think that we've got a pretty consistent story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so ultimately, you guys are seeing that the pipelines actually supplant the truck volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly the trucking transportation is an integral part of what's going on now. But pipelines are being extended and gathering systems are being built to replace a lot of that truck transportation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if I'm planning on buying a truck and driving it down to the Eagle Ford, you're telling me that I should probably hold off?</p>

          <p>Yes, it's no problem. And then, Jim, I'm curious as to how you're thinking about that 10% of US ethylene capacity that's forecast to be offline in September and October for planned maintenance. It seems like just looking at the data that spot ethylene prices have run in advance of a lot of these big turnarounds. So I'm curious as to your thoughts on what impact you think that could have on ethylene prices in the back half of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We receive &#x2013; of course we watch the ethylene market, and we've seen that ourselves and we think that the demand for ethylene is being paid out in the prices, and we think it's reflective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a little more color on the derivatives gain in the natural gas marketing group, and maybe provide what the intention was for entering that position and what happened to generate that amount of upside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, let me just touch on it briefly and then I'll let Chris get in more detail. But it's about an $18.2 million gain on derivatives that we look at as economic hedges. They just don't meet the requirement that you need for hedge accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly it. Mike hit right on the head. It's mostly from our Northern border position. It's the HH-Chicago spread. We have laid off that risk on the Northern border contract for the next two years. And we have that spread on at more than covering all our costs, and the spreads have come in drastically in the market. And there has been some liquidation in the basis market with the volatility here. So we locked it at a $0.60 spread. It's now currently getting marked inside well of $0.30, and you're realizing that money thanks to our former friends in the business that started mark-to-market accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John, we look at this as not letting accounting drive our business. So if we can put on an economic hedge, even if we don't get the hedge accounting, we're going to do it because we think that's the right thing to take risk out of the business. And we've had mark-to-market losses in previous periods. But since they are economic hedges, they're going to turn around, and this is indicative of what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if that spread widens back out, should we expect a loss, or is that position pretty much closed now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be a mark-to-market loss. They won't close until they roll off. So each month that the contract goes to its expiration, it will roll off at that point in time. So that's mark-to-market accounting in its purest sense. It's stupid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're looking at an entire period that those hedges are in place, the net effect of the mark-to-market gains and losses is you're going to have some gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well said, Chris. Thanks for the color on that. And then also on the &#x2013; Jim, can you provide some detail on how you look at the propane export market and how deep that market is? Is it really as easy the more we produce, the more we can export, or is there any limitation on that capability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it all comes back to the gas-to-crude spread, which makes this an attractive market to source LPG from. And to give you some flavor, and I'm going to look at Lynn, I think we're sold out through next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're sold out through 2012. We're continuing to sell through 2013 and beyond. We continue to have inquiries. And so I would say the market is sufficiently deep to absorb the expansion that we have coming online at the start of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not fully sold out on the expansion in the far forward market. We're going to be sold out on the front part of the &#x2013; I shouldn't say sold out. We have a tremendous amount of interest for the expansion capacity on the front end of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

Obviously, things have been weak for a little while; obviously, the markets being extraordinarily weak over the last week. But have you any seen any destocking activity from the pet-chems here recently, or are they still just a low-cost feedstock provider and running full out at this point?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

From a conceptual phase or project scope, we're going to laying about 640 miles from the MarkWest plant if we get the project done back to about the Calvert City where the West Lake cracker is. And then we'll take the existing 16-inch TEPCO line and reverse that so we can go back into Mont Belvieu with the ethane. It's way too early in the project now to talk about revenues.</p>

          <p>This is Chris. You're going to see a slow ramp up here in the month of September as we go online. But starting October 1 and for the next ten years, it's all demand: 99.3% demand charges, about 0.7% commodity. So it's pretty steady state and it's good, solid backed companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thanks, Chris; and then last one, just if you could just comment a little bit more on the recent market volatility. How does make you think about liquidity, financing, and maybe even potentially acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Acquisitions, that has not been on our list our list for some time. From time to time, we're opportunistic and we find assets that fit us that may not fit somebody else. But frankly, those are few and far between and pretty small in dollar size.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, we finished the quarter with a little over $2 billion of liquidity. As Bryan indicated, we're going out today for a $3.25 billion revolver, so we'll have additional liquidity there. And we've already got commitments for $3.2 billion of that. So I think we're going to be okay there.</p>
          <p>And just in terms of our continued growth, we finished the quarter again at under four times debt to EBITDA, so we're pretty comfortable with that. When Haynesville comes on, it should help us to lower that a bit. Frankly, we feel pretty good about where we are. We've done all that this year without raising equity. We have sold some of our ETE [Energy Transfer Equity] holdings, and that helps. But we think that this market uncertainty right now is more reflected in the equity markets. It seems that there is still plenty of liquidity in the banking system and plenty of appetite for our paper.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Ross.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is are you seeing much of a shift to more fee-based, maybe out of the Rockies in particular? And second of all, with the number of NGL lines coming in that have been announced from the Permian to Mont Belvieu, how do you view that potentially impacting your system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you from a fee based, this is Jim, Ross. From a fee based perspective, you couldn't get a keep-whole contract right now if your life depended on it. The producer wants that exposure, which is fine with us because with it gives us certainty.</p>
          <p>In terms of all the announcements out of the Permian and wherever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, what I'd say, Ross, is how it impacts our system was the question. If you look at our system and our tariffs are $0.015 to $0.02 a gallon to get from West Texas to Belvieu. The economics on all the new systems are going to need something north of $0.045, so I think we'll stay full in our location.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>I had it backwards, John. We spent $1.6 billion. We've got $2.2 billion left.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then the equity NGL production was down a little bit year over year. Could you give a little more detail on why that happened because, obviously, we weren't expecting that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think equity NGL production was down 5,000 barrels a day for the quarter, 4,000 barrels a day of that was because of the downtime at Pioneer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, so you're expecting that to basically ramp back up?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and then to the extent we have higher ethane extractions, you may get a little more out of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Back to Marcellus pipeline, people have been talking for years about an ethane solution, yet the producers haven't been willing to commit. Do you see a greater sense of urgency, or are the producers finally coming to the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're beginning, Becca. People that we were talking to once a month, we're now talking to three times a week. How's that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good but what is driving their change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason we're seeing the behavioral change is they were so focused on the short-term problem they had, they needed to solve a 30,000 to 40,000 barrel a problem. They've done that with the Sun line going to Sarnia. So now they're focused on the long-term issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so finally for them to commit, do you think we're three months away, six months away?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on the ethane, the potential ethane header project. Would you be looking for commitments from the petrochemical guys or the producers to move forward with that project? And if you did, ballpark, what kind of capital would you need for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're probably not going to give you the capital, Michael, but it's not as much as what the size of the system would indicate, in that we are using a lot of existing pipe, swapping services. And I think you are probably looking to the petrochemicals to make the commitments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's reflective of how we think. It's a standalone project regardless of Marcellus. But we focus always on giving the producer and the consumer a solution to the end-use market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Jim, the other question I had was if we are heading into a period of weaker economic environment, both globally and also domestically, how do you think that's going change the petrochemicals' decision making process in terms of to whether they're going to go ahead with new steam crackers in the Gulf Coast and the timing of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Who knows? But I think expansions can continue. It really boils down to you're going to have some ethylene produced. How competitive are you globally? The situation here is they're extremely competitive. So it's not necessarily these crackers that turn back.</p>
          <p>Back to your previous question, Bill just nudged me on that ethane header system. Only about 30% of that entire system is new pipe. Back to &#x2013; maybe somebody defers a newbuild Michael, I don't know. I do know this. Just in Dow Chemical's case, they've made the announcement just on expanding existing crackers; that can add 85,000 barrels a day of ethane demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In effect, you have to be looking forward because these things don't get built right away. It just a pretty long lead time.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>If I could just ask you about that ethane header system again, what's the industrial logic in terms of the demand side of the equation? Is it just to give the crackers the optionality to get supply, or how do you think about the market need?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As these guys expand, they are lacking the infrastructure to access the ethane beyond what they currently use. We think that this system has the wherewithal to give them access to that ethane. It's a pretty neat system when you think about it. I'm pretty proud of the guys to come up with a concept. When you have an ethane header from Corpus Christi to the Mississippi River tied to a huge storage location that takes wide grade from all over and produces a heck of a lot of ethane, that's sexy as heck when you think about the ability to just float on that system.</p>
