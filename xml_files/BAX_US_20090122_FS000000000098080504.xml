      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mary Kay, good morning everyone and thanks for calling in this morning.  We're pleased today to announce our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 and also provide our outlook for 2009.  Rob will provide more details in just a few minutes, but let me first start by saying that 2008 was an outstanding year for Baxter.  We believe we're very well positioned for 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>First, we exceeded all of our financial objectives for the year, achieving record sales, earnings, and cash flow despite a very challenging global economic climate that developed particularly late in the year.  Worldwide, we succeeded in driving growth through geographic expansion, leveraging the momentum of our existing businesses while concurrently pursuing selected new business development opportunities and accelerating our investment in research and development to its highest level in the company's history.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS of $0.91 exceeded guidance for the quarter and increased 20% versus the prior year.  Full year adjusted EPS of $3.38 per share increased 21% and exceeded our original full year EPS guidance range of $3.10 to $3.18 per share.</p>
          <p>Sales growth for the quarter excluding FX was robust, increasing 9%, which clearly reinforces the value and strength of our diversified business model and illustrates the solid fundamentals underpinning our portfolio.</p>
          <p>I'm also particularly encouraged with the consistency of our improving margins.  Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter and full year was approximately 51%, a historic level for the company.  Adjusted operating income as a percentage of sales was 22.6% in the fourth quarter and approximately 22% for the full year, which represents an improvement of over 100 basis points versus 2007.</p>
          <p>As we look forward beyond 2008, we continue to be enthusiastic about the margin expansion opportunities derived from improved product and business mix, intense focus on pricing opportunities, and disciplined control of manufacturing costs and productivity improvements throughout our global manufacturing footprint.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2008, each of Baxter's global businesses continued to &#x2013; or contributed to our overall performance financially, operationally, and strategically.  So I'd like to take just a moment to highlight some of &#x2013; a few of the achievements from across all three businesses, first starting with Medication Delivery.  We extended our presence in the global anesthesia market with the continued success of SUPRANE, augmented by the launch of Baxter's sevoflurane in nine new markets across Europe.  Our global anesthesia sales totaled more than $450 million in 2008 and grew 10% for the year.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to highlight our Nutrition business, which was the fastest growing business within Medication Delivery in 2008.  Annual sales of our Nutrition business increased 13% in 2008 and now exceed $600 million on a global basis, primarily as a result of increased demand for our proprietary multi-chamber container outside the US.  We launched our V-Link Luer-Activated device, the first needleless IV connector containing an antimicrobial coating that has been shown to kill 99.9% of specific common pathogens that cause catheter-related bloodstream infections including MRSA, or 'mersa'.</p>
          <p>We completed a study of 50 patients using Hylenex for pediatric hydration.  Hylenex enables the dispersion and absorption of fluids and drugs.  The results from this study will be published in 2009.</p>
          <p>And on the COLLEAGUE front, despite some disappointments in 2008, we did continue to make progress.  We've now remediated more than 100,000 of the COLLEAGUE single channel pumps and continue to be in active dialogue with the FDA relative to additional software modifications, the clinical evaluation of pump enhancements, and potential changes to complete our current remediation plan.  For this reason, we've elected not to include revenue related to the US commercialization of COLLEAGUE in our 2009 guidance, but do hope to have more details to share with you in the coming months.  In addition, we continue to move forward with a number other initiatives that reflect our continued commitment to our infusion system business.</p>
          <p>In the renal business, Baxter played an important role in supporting the passage of US Medicare reforms that are expected to make peritoneal dialysis a more competitive therapy option in the years ahead.  Specifically, the provisions eliminate incentives that currently favor the prescribing of hemodialysis and provide reimbursement for pre-end stage renal disease education.  Studies have shown that given unbiased, objective education on treatment options, about 50% of all patients would choose home therapy versus 8% of patients on PD today.  These provisions have already been approved and become effective in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of the Mexico tender, which we spoke of previously, we achieved 7% growth in PD patients in 2008.  This was driven by increased penetration in the developed markets and double digit patient gains in China and the rest of Asia.  We continue to strengthen our global leadership position and expand geographically as governments, particularly in the developing world, focus on providing increased access to treatment for patients with end stage renal disease.</p>
          <p>And we also continue development to expand our leadership in home dialysis therapy with our partner DEKA on a home hemodialysis device, which progressed well throughout 2008.  We've now completed development of a prototype and expect to begin clinical trials in 2009, leading to an anticipated market launch in 2011.</p>
          <p>And finally within BioScience, we're very pleased with the continued success of ADVATE.  With annual sales of more than $1.5 billion, ADVATE has now established a leadership position in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, and an array of other companies.  And we continue to expand this position with our industry leading range of dosage strengths, which enables more precise dosing and increased convenience for patients.</p>
          <p>Also in the area of hemophilia, we've made progress in the development of a recombinant form of von Willebrand Factor, another protein critical to clotting for people with von Willebrand disease.  von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder in both men and women and recently we announced the initiation of Phase I clinical program.</p>
          <p>Immunotherapy, we initiated three Phase III clinical programs with the intent of expanding approved indications for GAMMAGARD LIQUID or IGIV.  These trials include one evaluating the use of GAMMAGARD LIQUID for multifocal motor neuropathy or MMN, a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive limb weakness, primarily affecting the upper extremities; and another for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
          <p>In addition, we recently announced the start of a Phase III trial combining GAMMAGARD LIQUID combined with Enhanze, Halozyme's proprietary drug delivery technology for subcutaneous dosing of IGIV to patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders.  Subcutaneous administration of GAMMAGARD LIQUID via a single site could allow patients to administer their dose of IGIV once monthly at home.</p>
          <p>In regenerative medicine, we continue to augment our biosurgery portfolio with the launch of ARTISS, the first and only slow-setting fibrin sealant indicated for use in adhering skin grafts in burn patients, and with the launch of GELFOAM PLUS, a hemostatic device for use in surgical procedures.  We also advanced several programs with our partner Kuros Biosurgery AG, focused on the development and commercialization of a portfolio of hard and soft tissue repair products, which if successful will allow us to enter the fast growing orthobiologics market.</p>
          <p>And finally in the vaccine business, we advanced both our pandemic and seasonal influenza programs.  We're currently conducting two Phase III clinical trials utilizing our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, and we've recently received a positive opinion in Europe for our candidate pandemic vaccine, which provides us with the license and ability to market the vaccine in the event of a pandemic.</p>
          <p>So all in all, it has been a very productive year.  Just to briefly summarize, consistent with our strategic priorities, we accelerated on an adjusted basis overall R&amp;D spending in 2008 by 20% to almost $900 million, a record level for the company.  We received approval for or launched an array of new products during the year, initiated eight major Phase III clinical trials, advanced numerous early-stage internal programs, and established new partnerships with companies like Nektar, Nycomed, and Innocoll just to name a few.</p>
          <p>In 2009 and beyond, given our strong foundation and financial flexibility, we'll continue to advance our product pipeline and do so with disciplined project management and increased productivity while balancing the pipeline with both short and long-term opportunities, and always with a continued focus on value creation.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call over to Rob for a more detailed discussion on our Q4 results, also our outlook for 2009.  And when Rob concludes his commentary, I'll have just a few additional comments and perspectives to share before we then open up the call to Q&amp;A.  So, Rob?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning everyone.  As Bob mentioned, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which included strong organic sales growth, continued margin expansion, and earnings that exceeded our guidance.  We're also very pleased with our ability to generate strong cash flow and to deliver significant value to our shareholders through our disciplined capital allocation strategy.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly walk you through the P&amp;L by line for Q4 before providing with the details on our financial outlook for 2009.  Starting with sales, our reported sales in the quarter totaled approximately $3.1 billion and increased 4%.  Excluding foreign currency, sales growth of 9% exceeded our guidance of approximately 7% and was driven by better than expected recombinant sales, robust growth across all major product categories within BioScience, and strong growth in Medication Delivery, particularly in the global injectables business.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in the US was 6%, the highest quarterly growth of the year.  This was a result of consistent double digit sales growth for BioScience and an acceleration of growth in the Medication Delivery business.  International sales increased 3% on a reported basis; and excluding foreign currency, sales growth was 10%, with strong growth across all regions and most major product categories.  Year-to-date sales increased 10% and sales growth excluding foreign currency was 6%.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to remind you that in 2008, we annualized several items that created difficult growth comparisons for us over the past year or so like the Transfusion Therapies divestiture, BeneFIX, Propofol, and the Mexican PD tender, which all in total impacted our 2008 full year sales growth by approximately two to three percentage points.</p>
          <p>In terms of individual business performance, let me start with Medication Delivery, which had fourth quarter sales totaling approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 2% on a reported basis.  Excluding foreign currency, Medication Delivery sales accelerated and increased 7%, which on an organic basis represented the highest quarterly growth rate of the year.  This acceleration was primarily driven by improved growth in the US, where sales increased 5%, driven by solid performance of IV therapy and anesthesia products and positive growth in the global injectables business for the first time this year.</p>
          <p>International sales in Medication Delivery declined 1% on a reported basis.  But excluding foreign currency, sales increased 8%.  For the full year, Medication Delivery sales of $4.6 billion increased 8%.  And excluding foreign currency, sales were up 5%, exceeding our full year guidance of approximately 4% of growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to the product categories, IV therapy sales in the fourth quarter totaled $393 million and increased 1%.  Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 7% and continue to be driven by solid demand for IV solutions globally, US pricing improvements, and strong growth in our Nutritions business.</p>
          <p>Infusion system sales totaled $222 million in the quarter and declined 6%.  Excluding foreign currencies, sales declined 2% as COLLEAGUE remediation revenues were more than offset by lower sales of access sets.</p>
          <p>Sales of global injectables increased 8% to $420 million as a result of strong growth in the US.  US sales increased 11%, the strongest growth of the year, as the negative comparison for heparin was more than offset by mid-teens growth in our pharma partnering business and strong growth of certain premixed and multi-source generic drugs.  The international growth was once again the result of solid growth in our pharmacy compounding business.</p>
          <p>And finally, anesthesia sales totaled $131 million and increased 4%.  Excluding foreign currency, sales increased 7%, driven by the global penetration of SUPRANE and growth of sevoflurane.</p>
          <p>Moving on to renal, fourth quarter sales totaled $557 million and declined 7% on a reported basis.  Adjusting for foreign currency, sales declined 3%.  This was the continued result of a decline in hemodialysis sales and the difficult comparison created by the loss of the Mexican PD tender in the first quarter of 2008.  Renal sales for the full year totaled $2.3 billion, an increase of 3%, with currency contributing five points of this growth.  Excluding foreign currency therefore, sales declined by 2%.</p>
          <p>Globally, PD sales totaled $458 million in the fourth quarter and declined 5% on a reported basis.  Excluding foreign currency, global PD sales were down 1%.  Excluding both the impact of the lost tender in Mexico and foreign currency, international PD sales were up approximately 4%, and global PD sales also increased 4%.  This growth is due to the expanded use of peritoneal dialysis in many developed and emerging markets around the world.  In the US, we continue to see positive PD patient growth, which resulted in a 7% increase in US PD sales.</p>
          <p>Hemodialysis sales in the fourth quarter of $99 million were down 18%; and excluding foreign currency, sales declined by 12%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to BioScience, BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.4 billion and increased 12%.  Excluding foreign currency, BioScience sales increased 17% with double digit growth across all major product categories.  For the full year, BioScience sales grew 16% to $5.3 billion.  And excluding currency, sales increased 13%, which exceeded our expectation of more than 10% growth.</p>
          <p>Recombinant sales in the quarter of 506 million increased 9% on a reported basis and were up 14% excluding the impact of foreign currency.  As Bob mentioned earlier, ADVATE sales of more than $1.5 billion for the full year exceeded our original expectations.  While ADVATE conversion in Europe remained over 90%, international sales were still robust and increased 20% for the quarter on a constant currency basis.  US recombinant sales increased 7%, and conversion to ADVATE continues.  In fact, we ended the year with US conversion of more than 60% compared to conversion of just over 50% in the US last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the plasma business, in the quarter plasma protein sales of 330 million increased 10%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, plasma protein sales increased 12%.  Performance continues to be driven by strong demand for plasma-derived Factor VIII, albumin, and ARALAST, as well as improved pricing.  US plasma protein sales increased 18% while international sales increased 5% on a reported basis or 9% on a constant currency basis.  Antibody therapy sales increased 10% to $309 million in the quarter.  And excluding foreign currency, antibody therapy sales grew 14%, driven by strong demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID and pricing improvements.</p>
          <p>Sales in the regenerative medicine business totaled $101 million and increased 6%.  Growth excluding foreign currency was 12% in the quarter as a result of strong growth of both FLOSEAL and COSEAL.</p>
          <p>Finally, revenues in the other category totaled $113 million and included the large vaccine order of approximately $50 million that we discussed with you last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the rest of the P&amp;L and starting with gross margin, adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter of 51.2% improved sequentially by 60 basis points and improved year over year by 180 basis points.  This margin expansion is the result of favorable foreign exchange, improved business and product mix, pricing improvements across multiple businesses, and manufacturing efficiencies.</p>
          <p>For the full year, I'm pleased to report that our gross margin of 50.7% improved 170 basis points versus the 49% we achieved in 2007.  And as Bob pointed out earlier, we believe we have further margin expansion opportunities over our long-range plan.</p>
          <p>Turning to SG&amp;A; SG&amp;A of $674 million in the quarter increased 3% compared to the prior year.  Excluding foreign currency, SG&amp;A increased in mid-single digits.  SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was 21.5%, reflecting a 20 basis point reduction versus the prior year.  For the full year, SG&amp;A increased 9%, with foreign currency contributing approximately three points of growth.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D spending of $219 million increased 6%.  And excluding currency, R&amp;D grew in the high single digits.  For the full year, R&amp;D spending of $849 million increased 20%.  This growth is the result of investments we are making across all three businesses, particularly in many of the programs that Bob mentioned earlier in his opening comments.</p>
          <p>Interest expense was $14 million compared to $12 million last year, and other expense was 1 million in the quarter compared to $4 million last year.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 17.3% was slightly lower than our guidance and reflected the impact of the R&amp;D tax credit, as we discussed with you last quarter, as well as adjustments to valuation allowances.  Excluding these items, our operational tax rate remains at approximately 19%.</p>
          <p>Finally, as previously mentioned, adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.91, an increase of 20%.  And adjusted EPS for the full year of $3.38 increased 21%.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow, we had another very strong year.  Excluding the 240 million pension contribution in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations for 2008 totaled more than $2.7 billion.  This represents more than a $400 million improvement over the $2.3 billion of cash flow reported last year and exceeded our original cash flow guidance of $2.5 billion.  Including the outflow related to pension contributions, cash flow from operations totaled $2.5 billion, an improvement of more than $200 million versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our total DSO, which ended the year at 50.6 days, improved five days versus last quarter and is approximately three days lower than last year.  Inventory turns of 2.5 turns were also better than last quarter and were flat to last year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for the year totaled $954 million as we continue to invest in appropriate capacity across our businesses to support our future growth.</p>
          <p>And lastly, as we commented on in this morning's press release, during 2008 we paid dividends totaling approximately $550 million and repurchased 32 million shares of common stock for approximately $2 billion.  On a net basis, this amounts to repurchases of 18 million shares or $1.4 billion, which exceeded our commitment of $1 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm particularly pleased with our ongoing ability to generate strong cash flows.  We continue to return significant value to shareholders as a result of our improved financial flexibility, capital allocation strategy, and disciplined financial management, while accelerating investments in R&amp;D both internally and through selected business development activities that will position us well for future growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook and guidance for 2009.  As you saw in the press release, we expect earnings of $3.70 to $3.78 per diluted share.  This guidance reflects a potential modest impact to sales due to the uncertainty in the global macro environment, continued expansion of gross and operating margins, select investments in marketing and promotional activities to support our growth going forward, and increased R&amp;D spending.  More specifically, we expect full year sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange of approximately 7%.  We expect our reported sales growth to be approximately flat to 2008, which does assume current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we expect gross profit as a percentage of sales to improve by more than 150 basis points, reflecting continued expansion in BioScience, improved profitability in Medication Delivery and our core PD business, and a benefit from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>We expect annual R&amp;D growth in low single digits.  Given that more than 40% of our R&amp;D is outside of the US, however, this growth rate is dampened by the stronger US dollar.  Therefore, on a constant currency basis, R&amp;D is increasing approximately 10%.</p>
          <p>We expect SG&amp;A to decline in the low single digits.  However, this growth rate is also impacted by a stronger US dollar.  And on a constant currency basis, SG&amp;A would increase in low to mid-single digits.  We expect to tightly manage general and administrative expenses, especially in light of the current environment, while investing in marketing and promotional activities to support the growth of our higher returning and higher growing products.</p>
          <p>We expect to continue our trend of year-over-year operating margin improvement in 2009 with an improvement of approximately 200 basis points to approximately 24%.  We expect interest expense of between 90 to $100 million and other expense to total approximately $60 million.  We expect our tax rate to approximate 18.5 to 19%.  And finally, we expect a full year average share count of 615 to 620 million shares as a result of our share repurchase activities.</p>
          <p>From a cash flow perspective, we expect cash flow from operations to exceed $2.6 billion and capital expenditures to total approximately $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now to expand on the sales assumptions for each of the three businesses, for the full year 2009 we expect renal sales excluding the impact of foreign currency to increase in the range of 4 to 6%.  This is the result of solid single digit growth in PD and flat to declining HD sales.</p>
          <p>For Medication Delivery, we expect sales excluding foreign currency to also grow in the 4 to 6% range.  This will be driven by several factors.  First, at constant rates, we expect anesthesia to grow in low double digits due to demand for SUPRANE and additional market launches of sevoflurane.  Second, we expect the IV therapy and global injectables businesses to grow in mid-single digits.  And lastly, we expect infusion system sales to be flat due to lower COLLEAGUE remediation revenues year over year.</p>
          <p>Finally, for the BioScience business, we expect sales growth excluding foreign currency to once again exceed 10%, driven by strong growth across the portfolio.  First, we expect recombinant sales growth in high single digits.  Second, we expect plasma protein and antibody therapy sales to grow in mid-teens, driven by improved pricing and strong demand.  Third, we expect the regenerative medicine business to again grow in mid-teens.  And finally, we expect the other category, which includes our vaccines business, to grow in mid-single digits.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, as we mentioned in our press release, we expect earnings per diluted share of $0.80 to $0.82 and sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of approximately 7%.  Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect our reported sales in the first quarter to be approximately flat to the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In summary, our 2009 guidance reflects the ongoing operational strength of our businesses and ability to deliver sustainable growth.  It is aligned with our long range strategic and financial objectives.  Although we are operating in a volatile and challenging macro environment, the potential effects of which continue to evolve, we remain focused on delivering growth while making appropriate investments for the future.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Bob.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob.  Before we open up the call to Q&amp;A, I'd just like to make a few closing comments.  Clearly, 2008 was a very successful year for Baxter financially, operationally, and strategically.  And while we're certainly not without challenges, we believe our company is very well positioned for 2009 even in today's challenging global macro environment.  The progress that we've made over the last several years to improve the quality of our balance sheet and financial performance will provide flexibility and yield great benefits in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p>The global economy will continue to struggle for the foreseeable future, and companies in many industries are faced with unprecedented economic challenges.  While no company including Baxter is completely immune to potential impacts, given the medically necessary nature of our products, our diversified healthcare model, and strong market positions, we're confident in our ability to derive improved performance and grow even in this uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 outlook is aligned with the solid underlying fundamentals we see in the markets in which we operate.  And we remain committed to driving growth while investing in innovation and business development activities that position us for the future.</p>
          <p>We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Conference on September 16 of this year in Chicago.  At that time, we'll provide more insight into a number of our R&amp;D programs in all of our businesses.  And we'll also provide a longer term outlook on the financial performance of the company, with particular focus on strategic business segments that are critical to our future.  In the meantime, we begin 2009 well positioned for continued success.</p>
          <p>So with that, we'll open up the call to Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Good morning, congratulations on another good quarter.  Let me start by asking a few financial questions that probably would be helpful.  I would say one, with the 2009 guidance, if you could &#x2013; I think it would be helpful for everybody if you talked a little bit about the gross margin drivers.  You're calling for more than 150 basis points of improvement again in 2009.  I think adding some commentary as to the drivers behind that would probably be helpful for people.  Two, the shares outstanding guidance seems to imply about 550 million of net repurchases based on when the stock is out today.  Is that right?  And then third, $1 billion in CapEx in 2009 is higher than what we were modeling, so we'd like to get some insights into that.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Mike.  Let me start with the gross margin discussion and Rob can think a little bit in responding to the buyback question and the CapEx.  As we've discussed previously, there are a number of factors that give us a basis of optimism I think in terms of continued gross margin expansion going forward.  It starts with what I would call business mix.  As you listen to Rob's detail on guidance for next year, clearly our BioScience business is projected to grow at a faster rate than the other businesses.  As you know, it is a higher margin business, and so that is a continued contributor to gross margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Having said that, within each of our businesses, particular business units that have higher gross margins are growing at a faster rate.  We highlighted in Medication Delivery for example, the growth year to year, '08 versus '07, of our anesthesia business and our Nutritionals business, both of which have higher gross margins than Medication Delivery overall.  And again for '09, we're projecting these business units to grow at a faster rate than Medication Delivery.  So those are examples of business units that are higher margin growing at a faster rate.  So again, business mix led by BioScience, business unit mix within the various businesses, all of our higher growth vehicles tend to be business units or businesses that are higher gross margins.</p>
          <p>Of course, I think the hallmark of our company is our focus on manufacturing efficiencies, yield improvements in our BioScience business, value improvement programs in Medication Delivery and renal, and so on, and we continue to pursue manufacturing efficiencies in our global manufacturing footprint with a passion.</p>
          <p>The final thing I would say, Mike, is our focus on price and we are pursuing price aggressively in those businesses or business segments where we think opportunity exists.  We're all aware of the pricing opportunities that continue to exist within plasma proteins.  But our pricing improvement story is actually much broader than that, and a good example of that again being our core IV business in the US, where we're experiencing price improvements to a greater degree than we have in years.  So those are really the primary drivers for gross margin expansion.  I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Rob, before we move on to the other two pieces of Mike's question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Why don't you address the buyback question and also the CapEx projection for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Mike, we're assuming on a net basis $750 million of purchases, so it could be just in the way you're phasing those, but that's currently what we're operating to.  And obviously as we move through the year, that's something we'll continue to evaluate as we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>With regard to the capital expenditures, the $1 billion is really a good story.  And what it really tells you is that as we continue to become more confident in the continued growth in our business, as we continue to see the need for capacity expansion across all of the businesses and to invest in our R&amp;D infrastructure, that has led us to increased investments from where we originally expected.  I'd point out that it's not due to programs which are costing more or being significantly extended in time.  It is truly due to the fact that we find new capital investment opportunities to drive growth more than we expected.  So that's really what's behind the $1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I need to do one follow-up, then I'll let others jump in here.  Bob, you grew organically 9% on the top line this quarter, which is obviously a very strong quarter for Baxter.  And you're guiding at a starting point of 7% for 2009.  It would certainly appear and it's the Street's assumption that the economy is not having a significant impact on your business.  Are there any touch points that we should be watching through 2009, and how good is your visibility relative to your different businesses right now?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there's a lot there.  Let me try to be pretty succinct here.  First of all the 9% was benefited to some degree based on vaccine sales in the fourth quarter.  But I think if you look over the last year or two, we pretty consistently &#x2013; when you adjust for FX, the TT divestiture, the BeneFIX loss, and so on, we've been running organic growth around the 8% range.  Our organic projection for growth projection for next year, as Rob mentioned, is 7%.  Candidly, that reflects some modest impact to really the potential impact of the global economic environment in which we operate.  Nobody has a crystal ball.  I mean we think we're very well positioned because of the medically necessary nature of our products.  Frankly, people are not going to go off dialysis therapy or therapy for hemophilia or immune disorders because of the economy.</p>
          <p>I would say that if you looked at our Medication Delivery business, we know that many hospitals are experiencing a softening in hospital admissions, to some degree surgical procedures.  Frankly, whether or not those are procedures that consume IV solutions to a great degree and so on, we don't really know.  And through the fourth quarter, we haven't really experienced anything, but we thought it prudent as we pulled together our plan for next year to reflect something there.  But I think we have a pretty high confidence level that we can deliver the 7% organic growth.</p>
          <p>The other things in the economy, since you raised it and this is probably a basis for other follow-on questions, so we ought to address it at the outset.  We do believe that we will begin experiencing some DSO deterioration because of the economic environment in 2009.  Although interestingly in the fourth quarter, we had our best DSO quarter in a long time including in the US, so go figure.</p>
          <p>In terms of emerging and developing markets as their healthcare budgets get scrutinized, perhaps reduced to some degree, we may begin experiencing some impact on lower volumes and access to some of the tenders, although as of yet we haven't seen that.  And of course, the other practical area that hospitals are dealing with, particularly in the US, because of cash constraints and liquidity constraints and so on is CapEx spending.  And as you know, we have very little that really is impacted by that.  A bit of an irony, it may even serve to secure our COLLEAGUE base longer and the channel erosion that we've experienced over the last couple of years.  So I'll stop there.  There may be specific follow-ons to that, Mike, but I'll just conclude there now.</p>

          <p>Hey, Mike, it's Mary Kay.  I'd also like to add to Bob's comments in terms of the sales growth guidance.  One thing we didn't mention in our prepared comments is that transfusion therapy sales will be declining in 2009 to about 50 million for the full year.  That's versus 2008 of about 170 million, so that also has about a 1% impact on our overall sales growth.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question, Rick Wise of Leerink Swann is on the line with a question.  Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Rick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, let me talk about a strategic issue first.  Acquisitions I think have been on your mind from the beginning as a potential growth driver, a couple parts.  Do you think the environment is more attractive?  Is Baxter now more likely &#x2013; given what should be better pricing and availability, are you more inclined or less inclined now in the next 12 months?  And if there are any areas you want to highlight, I'd be happy to hear that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks, Rick.  First of all, let me say this.  If you look back over the last several years, of course our BD activities have been limited largely to licensing, acquiring smaller products that are complementary, and so on.  But I think our strategy of focusing internally on really extracting value that exists in our existing core businesses has proven to be the right strategy given our improved financial results and not distracting the organization to acquisitions and so on.</p>
          <p>I would say that while there continues to be great opportunity for growth and margin expansion going forward in our existing businesses, we're in a position now as a company both in terms of our improved financial position over the last few years and I also think importantly our organizational capabilities to now be a bit more expansive in evaluating opportunities and perhaps bringing things in, including acquisitions.  And it's happening at a time where as you pointed out or referenced, Rick, in your question, the environment is such &#x2013; or implied in your question, the environment is such that there may be &#x2013; it may be a more target rich environment right now.  And so clearly, we're very open minded to that, but we're also very cognizant of our need to be disciplined and not do deals for the sake of doing deals, but doing deals that we are confident will create value for our shareholder.  So, we've got our BD teams evaluating opportunities.  We're looking at it.  I think like I said, we have the financial wherewithal and now the organizational wherewithal to perhaps do some things, and you all will be the first to know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On COLLEAGUE, you highlighted that you're not assuming everything gets resolved this year.  What's left to resolve if it's worth discussing?  On the competitive front, there have been some major GPO contract wins for one of your competitors.  And maybe just the last part of that, if COLLEAGUE were to come back, can you help us think what that might mean for any given quarter or any 12 month period incrementally just to put things in perspective in year one of a resolution of the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, Rick, relative to the GPO situation, I'm not sure that any of our competitors have carved out a unique position with any GPO that has really created an obstacle for us or a barrier in terms of COLLEAGUE going forward.  There have been GPOs that have made multiple awards to all suppliers, but it doesn't necessarily close the door to us.  So I think it's important to clarify that at the outset.</p>
          <p>If you hearken back to the time when we were commercializing COLLEAGUE in the US, we were generating roughly $150 million of sales associated with placement of hardware in any given year.  That does not include of course the disposable trail that's associated with that.  So that's probably the best kind of high level number I can give you in response to when we get back in a position where we can recommercialize what one might expect on an annual basis.  I suppose one could also suggest that there may be some pent-up demand in accounts that have not been able to buy COLLEAGUEs, but hopefully at some point will be able to.  But I don't really want to speculate what that might be, but that's an order of magnitude response, Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  A last quick one, when do you &#x2013; when should we expect to see the Phase III IGIV data, and if there are any other indications undergoing clinical trials and market opportunities that might pop up through the year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  You're referring to, Rick, on the first part about Alzheimer's.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Alzheimer's.  Mary Kay, why don't you go through the Alzheimer's as well as maybe some of the other Phase III initiatives on GAMMAGARD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  On Alzheimer's, Rick, we just started the Phase III, so that is an 18-month trial with 360 patients.  We're anticipating right now about 12 months for the patient enrollment, and we will not have an interim look at that data.  So it's going to be a couple of years before you see any Phase III results on the Alzheimer's trial.</p>
          <p>You will see though in 2009 the Phase II 18-month results.  And at this point in time, we can't give you a timeframe for that.  That's really being handled by Dr. Relkin.  And when he decides on his opportunity to present that information, we will let you know where that will be and when that will be.  We also have ongoing, as Bob mentioned earlier in his comments, a Phase III for MMN, and that's about a 40 patient trial 15-months follow-up, so that probably &#x2013; you won't see anything until 2010 on MMN.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Lots of clients have expressed concerns to us regarding the fact that the economy is bringing more people into the plasma collection centers.  Clearly, your ability to take price in plasma products, and we're estimating almost 10% this year, suggests to us that the supply/demand balances is just fine for IVIG in particular.  Could you comment on that phenomenon with regards to drawing people into collection centers and what the relative rates of intrinsic demand versus supply might be for IVIG globally?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bruce, this is Bob.  Let me start and then maybe Rob or Mary Kay could support my comments.  First of all, I don't believe that the number of people coming forward willing to donate plasma necessarily has any impact relative to the overall supply.  I think the supply is a function of installed capacity, which as you pointed out and we continue to believe is well balanced with demand.  If anything, I suppose it might imply over time the cost of collecting plasma may go down, although we haven't experienced that to date.  But I don't see that phenomenon, in other words more people presenting at the plasma center to donate plasma and get paid for doing that, as really a relevant variable in terms of the supply equation.  Rob or Mary Kay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would just add that it's important because we've gotten this question a lot.  It's important to understand the bottleneck today in the supply side of the equation is the collection capacity in the industry.  So if you are running your center at capacity, which we largely are, we've been able over 2008 to do a great job.  Frankly, our BioScience team has done a great job of squeezing additional yields from our existing footprints.  But once you reach capacity in a center, the number of people presenting doesn't change the capacity of the people you can move through.  So that's why we continue to believe this has not had any meaningful impact on total collections.  I think to Bob's point, it continues to cause you to rethink how you price the collections, how do you market for collections.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would note that where you have seen some is at least anecdotally, we've heard that there was a reduction in people donating plasma, free plasma if you will, whole blood to the American Red Cross and similar organizations in hopes of trying to do it to a fee-based center.  But again if the capacity is limited, that won't change the total numbers.</p>
          <p>On the second part of your question, we continue long term to believe we're going to see from a total market perspective growth in volume of mid to high single digits and growth in price of low to mid-single digits longer term.  We did better than that in both categories in 2008, and we will see how it plays out during 2009.  I think the important thing here and we've talked a lot about this externally is really to understand the demand side of this picture.  We are increasingly confident in the robustness and sustainability of the demand.  As you heard, we're driving new indications.  We're seeing favorable demographics; so all the factors are really driving the demand stronger; and to us, that's the real key that gives us the confidence of sustainability.  Now all we have to do as an industry is to make sure we keep supply up with demand, keep it in balance, and we're confident we can do that.  So no change in our view of stability, no change in what we see as collection growth, it's steady as she goes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific.  Just one follow-up, could you talk a bit about the dynamics you see in the dialysis segment next year and how you arrived at I guess mid-single digits growth in PD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, this is Bob.  Bruce, probably I would differentiate the US market versus let's say emerging developing markets, which continue as we commented and as you know to be the primary driver for growth.  The most significant event that transpired in the US in 2008 of course was Medicare legislation that relates to both patient education to ensure that all patients that need to be treated are aware of the various therapies that are available including PD.  That has not been the case and that's going to be required in 2010; and then of course new reimbursement &#x2013; composite rate reimbursement in 2011, which frankly we believe will level the playing field in terms of the economics and the economic decision that comes into play in terms of selecting therapy, HD or PD.  So we think these are the external events that will set the stage for enhanced PD growth, perhaps significantly let's say 2011 and beyond; so that's a very positive development.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that in emerging developing markets, China being a great example, we're going to continue to experience strong growth, where in many of these markets PD is much more broadly embraced than HD.  And to a large degree, it's because you don't have some of the economic dynamics that exist in the US market.</p>
          <p>As I referenced in my prepared comments and you've heard us say before, when presented with options of therapies, 50% of the patients in virtually every country around the world frankly would prefer to be on home dialysis.  The convenience associated with that from a cost point of view, typically delivering therapy in the home is a lower cost than in a center for I think some obvious reasons.  And finally for many patients, the clinical outcomes are enhanced.  And so while the last couple years have been a challenge in our overall renal business in a number of ways, we continue to be very bullish about the long-term prospects of the Renal business.  And I think this is one of the areas we'll expand on in our September Investors Conference to give you a little bit more insight as to the basis of our confidence in the years ahead.</p>

          <p>I just have one follow-up question on demand from Rob's comments, and then two questions on investment maybe for Bob.  Rob, you mentioned a driver being the demand side, not the supply side.  Obviously emerging markets have been a component of that.  It looked like international growth in some of the BioScience units was weak in the fourth quarter, obviously not carrying forward into your '09 guidance.  But can you comment on any softness in South America, any of the BRIC countries, Russia or China, as it relates to emerging market demand for therapeutics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the short answer is we saw no softness that would be endemic of anything going on in the broader economy.  It was really timing of how things moved through the quarters.  In fact, in Russia as an example, we had a successful large tender.  So there is no &#x2013; you should take no sign and I would look to our 2009 guidance as confidence of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I'd also, David, remind you that when we talked about this back in Q3, we had most of our tenders in Q3 this year, and last year they were in Q4.  So we had a really difficult comp across the plasma proteins in 2008 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very helpful; and then maybe, Bob, two questions on investment, the first on capital spending, obviously close to $1 billion this year.  When you think about the level of your investment, you think into the out years in 2010 and beyond, does this level of investment in manufacturing and fractionation give you the confidence that perhaps in a pricing environment that's less favorable in 2010 and beyond, these types of investments are going to enable you to still increase gross margins at the kind of rates we've seen historically of 100 to 150 bps a year?</p>

          <p>I don't think &#x2013; regarding the second part of your question, David, given the fairly dramatic ramp-up in plasma pricing, if you go back over the last couple of years, while we're confident in our ability to deliver low to mid-single digit price increases going forward, because they're not going to be the same degree going forward than in the past that that particular dynamic will have a modulating effect.</p>
          <p>But I would say relative to CapEx spending, you can expect that kind of $1 billion range going forward.  I'm hopeful that that's the case because as Rob pointed out earlier, this is an investment largely in capacity to support not only volume growth of existing businesses but new indications for products and new products and so on.  So I would expect that around this level, maybe not every year, but I think really our annual spending on CapEx has ramped up.  But I think it's a good news story and we would anticipate that's going to continue.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And the second major leg of investment would obviously be in R&amp;D.  And I wonder if you think about the growth trajectory of your three major business units and you think about your relative level of R&amp;D across those units and the progression of the pipeline in those various segments, I wonder if you could tell us right now where you're feeling more comfortable and where you're feeling less comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, I think we have great opportunities, pipeline opportunities in all three of our businesses, and again I won't take the time this morning to enumerate those.  Having said that, we have ramped up our R&amp;D investment in BioScience at a faster rate than the other businesses and I think for some fairly obvious reasons.  I think one of the things I'm most pleased about as I reflect back on the last four or five years is that as a result of our improving financial performance, we have been able to fund a fairly dramatic ramp-up in R&amp;D.  And the nature of our pipeline has changed because if you go back five years ago, most of the stuff was really near-term opportunistic kinds of programs.  And today we have a great balance of yes, some of those kinds of programs, but things of more of a pharmaceutical nature, largely in our BioScience business which are longer term R&amp;D programs, may have a higher element of risk, but of course the payback attendant with that is higher.  And again as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we're projecting again in '09 to grow R&amp;D at a faster rate than top line organic growth, which is a strategic priority for the company.</p>
          <p>But again on this whole R&amp;D question, it will be one of the primary areas of focus in our September Investor Conference, because we've realized we haven't been terribly detailed on the pipeline and that will provide an opportunity I think to be a little more explicit than we've been in the past.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I just wanted to follow up on one quick question.  You mentioned during the discussion on Med Delivery that you saw some lower access set sales in the quarter.  Was there something unusual there or is that something we should be keeping an eye on a little more closely for '09 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, looking at that really from a dollar perspective, it wasn't real material, but the sales level in that business is so small that a small amount reflects a larger percentage.  So I think we were down 3, 4, $5 million in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was really small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing and let me just add to that just to be very direct because that's associated with COLLEAGUE placements and COLLEAGUE channels and so on.  We saw no meaningful further deterioration in the fourth quarter of our channel base.  So if you see that softness in access sales, don't conclude that's because our channel base of COLLEAGUE in the US declined dramatically.  It did not and it really is more of the quarterly dynamics given the smaller numbers and the percentages and so on that Mary Kay described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And one other question on anesthesia, you talked about continued geographic expansion.  If either &#x2013; maybe let's go through some of the particular countries you're going after, or another way to look at it is percentage of opportunity that's being opened up in '09; and then is there a material amount more or less for 2010 and beyond to sustain that anesthesia growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment maybe on the second part of the question first, Ben.  Yes, there is material opportunity for growth throughout the LRP, which is why we describe anesthesia really as a strategic business for Baxter.  As you know, we're the only company that has the full array of inhalation agents.  It's not a therapeutic area where the current products that are used are being obsoleted by next-generation technology.  So it's a great example of our global position, geographic expansion.  As healthcare budgets grow around the world, surgical procedures in developing and emerging markets grow at a faster rate.  We're going to be there, very well positioned with the full line of products to participate in that growth.  So yes, this is a long-term strategic business and priority for Baxter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the first part of your question, markets we're going to expand in, I don't really want to get into the detail of that, but there would be a number then.  I don't know Rob or Mary Kay have anything...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if your could help give us a sense in terms of maybe some of the BioScience products of what percentage would Medicaid be a payor.  And are you at all concerned about what some of the reimbursement could look like as states come under increasing financial pressure, and whether or not in this more difficult time, you might see any changes to maybe some of the prophylactic use within hemophilia products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Let me start maybe at a high level and then Rob and Mary Kay, you can think about this and add on as we close out the Q&amp;A here.  We've always said that reimbursement pressures exist for our primary products in the purely &#x2013; including certainly in the hemophilia sector in our BioScience business.  And as you know, the vast majority of those patients are not Medicare.  They are, as you pointed out in your question, Medicaid reimbursed and evaluated on a state-by-state basis.  So I think there is reason to think that given the economic environment, I mean clearly those pressures are going to continue, but they've existed for a long time.  There are a lot of dynamics why those pressures have not manifested themselves in a more precipitous climb in pricing.  So again, our position would be the reimbursement pressures will continue to be evolutionary in nature.  We do not see any kind of revolutionary event necessarily that's going to fundamentally change the slope of that line for the Medicaid reimbursed products.  Rob and Mary Kay, I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you a sense for IVIG as an example, it's about 15% under Medicaid; and then for our hemophilia products a little bit higher.  But for both, we still have the majority of our businesses outside of this realm.  And to Bob's point, we see it as evolutionary.  That being said, as we think about Bob's comment on the macro environment and how we think about our 7% organic growth, obviously we've contemplated all of that as we came up with our expectations for 2009.</p>
