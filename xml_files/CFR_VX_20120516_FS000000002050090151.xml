        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of our friends and to the people that are visiting the podcast because they've had a travel ban because of the treasury over-indulging a little bit. Sorry that we're missing you this year. We've had another very good year. In fact, I dare say, it's a record year in every respect in terms of sales, in terms of cash generated.</p>
          <p>And, obviously, you've seen the operating margin, now unlike <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:49) 2000, I'm not going to say that this is sustainable. We have no idea what the currencies are going to do even though we had a very strong Swiss franc this year.</p>
          <p>It was up 9% on the euro, and it obviously did affect our results. But I think it is a sign of the times that you get elected as the president of a major country, and you're invited for dinner in another country that night and you have no option but to go and your plane gets struck by lightning, you arrive an hour late. And you're there to discuss a third country that's probably going to call you on line three to say they're not repaying you. And in case they don't repay you, then your banks can't repay other people. So in circumstances like that I'm loath to make predictions for the next year. So anybody who's going to ask, so what do you think the next year looks like, why don't you just not ask the question because we're not going to answer any. And it's not that we're coy or funny, we don't know.</p>
          <p>We also do not know what the currencies are going to do. And we also do not know whether the Chinese are going to continue to buy ad infinitum, we don't know. We are living with a volatility. What we do know is that there is still an excess of debt, the leverage and &#x2013; but instead, some of that debt has migrated from the private sector into the public sector, but there is still excess leverage debt.</p>
          <p>Now in my world you either repay debt by generating profits and you create a tax base or you just renege. The third option, of course, is to just devalue the debt, which is financial repression. And obviously this is what the politicians have chosen, slowly but surely like you make <mark type="ph" /> that parte (03:47) they'll force these supposed AAA instruments down the necks of savings institutions and then they'll just devalue it a little bit. Just a touch.</p>
          <p>Now consumers are not stupid. The financial repression is already there. If you're a sailor and you've worked all of your life and you're in your 60s and you're retired, what yields have you got? Where are you returns? So not a pretty picture in Europe.</p>
          <p>The United States may probably because it's in their nature to get out of it but quicker &#x2013; however, they've got a serious fiscal issue that they'll have to address by the end of the year. I'm not sure how it's going to end up.</p>
          <p>Our goal is very simple. We're trying to create products with enough appeal. Products that would stand the test of time that have investment value that are in enough demand that we have some pricing power, that the price elasticity is right. And then we need to have them available in the right markets. It's no good having the right products in the wrong markets and nobody knows about you. When the people with money don't know that you exist, you may as well not exist. So we have over decades now, and I stress decades, it's not a new occurrence, tried to be in the most important regions of the world. Depending upon the way you start from the West Coast of the States all the way to Japan, we spent time and money and good people have gone there, and it's paying off today. If you do not have a global footprint and a global desirability, then you've got problems.</p>
          <p>We have seen this year the sales goes up nearly 30%, retail did outperform wholesale, if you can look there. The operating profit growth is 51% and that's obvious operating leverage kicking in. But be mindful that works in reverse as well. Then we've had a sharp increase in the profit and healthy cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>By now you're all going to say, "Okay, you've got &#x20AC;3 billion, what are you going to buy? What are you going to do?" Special dividends. When the Swiss franc increased by 8% against the euro this year, we increased our dividend by 20%. That's a 28% increase in the dividend. We discussed that. We feel it's sufficient. Next year is 25 years that I've been in charge of this business. We started this thing 25 years ago. We started in 1985, Ellen but it took us three years to get through all the 278 various steps with the help of <mark type="ph" /> Metreshoman (08:28) and others, but next year is 25 years.</p>
          <p>Things have changed dramatically. But over the period we managed to grow dividends and sales in odd currencies. Well, sales then cash flow, then dividends. When I said a few years ago that equalizes that we'd like to grow, be a goal for me to do it at 15% per year. Now &#x2013; and that does not make us the new utility stock, which by the way you can't find anywhere in the world anymore.</p>
          <p>Since you folks in the room and your cousins in the banks started telling people you've got lazy balance sheets, and every utility started borrowing too much because of dependability of dividends, of free cash flow, the telephone utilities, the water utilities, G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale des Eaux became Vivendi, much sexier name, but the predictability of the dividend disappeared.</p>
          <p>So the poor folks who are in retirement where do they go for a predictable dividend flow? Tom knows because he went for the right companies. Some people did go for the right companies, but when I grew up and when I was in Wall Street, there were companies with predictable, boring AT&amp;T, KPN, I'll run through all the water utilities. They've disappeared. They were financially geared up. They're gone they're gone, by and large. I'd like you to have a look to see how many companies you can find today in comparison to 30 years ago of widows and orphan stock.</p>
          <p>So what happened to the widows and orphans? They still live, but the universe of &#x2013; shares that they can invest in or bonds, oh lo and behold, bonds and currencies. Think about what's happened to that old clause and that's why I'm part of the 99%, not part of the 1%. I actually think we failed.</p>
          <p>We did not &#x2013; we behaved morally reprehensible in terms of what we're leaving for the next generation. Last two years ago, I told you we're going to have tearing the social fabric. We are going to have an emergence of a left wing and a right wing. And the left wing and the right wing are both so scary that they're almost the same.</p>
          <p>If you look at what's happening in Greece now, the party, the ultra left wing party that refuses to join, they're made up out of civil servants, teachers, nurses. They don't want to give up any privileges, whatsoever. These are things that we're going to live in, and I'm not prepared to stick my neck out and say which way it's going to go except that we will see more civil strife. I remember Paris, May 1968, I remember the Rosse Brigate and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:31) and because of the stupidity we've landed ourselves with the unemployment that's facing us. We're going to have issues, real issues.</p>
          <p>We feel it's prudent to have cash in those days. And &#x20AC;3 billion is not a lot. Apple, now that's a lot, okay. When you're talking of &#x20AC;100 billion, then it starts getting my attention. But &#x20AC;3 billion is not a lot of money and I'm going to &#x2013; and this is not disparaging what I'm saying now, but last year we had an opportunity to buy another famous jewelry company. We were offered first. It was sold for about &#x20AC;4 billion odd &#x2013; sorry, &#x20AC;4 billion. And then a number of you asked me why didn't we buy it. And I answered that our job here is to create goodwill and not to pay other people for goodwill, if you remember.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll give you a guess what is the multiple of Cartier's growth in EBIT. How much more is the growth in Cartier's profit than that other jewelry companies' total EBIT? Come on, the same? Take a guess. No, no, don't look there. Come on. Come on, folks, you &#x2013; nobody from my financial department, because you know it, okay. I'm willing to give a Cartier watch for somebody who gets to 10%. Come on.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I know. But we're sticking to five, because we don't want to insult other people, okay. So, it's five. Now, folks, seriously, what are we supposed to do? Do we open more Van Cleef and Cartier? And give Philippe Leopold-Metzger his due, Piaget boutiques, or do we go and buy other companies? I'd rather invest in things that we really know well. We never talk enough about places like Piaget. They are doing very well. So our view is use the money, support what we know and remember, in 2008, things weren't going that well, but we told our colleagues, "We'll back you. Go for it."</p>
          <p>In parts of the world now, real estate is so expensive, you're talking about a couple of hundred million for a site folks, okay? And if you need those premium sites, you need firing power and I do not want to get into the next cycle of debt. So please, we are not planning any acquisitions. We're comfortable with the cash. I think we've proven to you that by redeploying the cash internally in supporting not only our Jewellery, but our Watch Maisons and Fashion that we can actually do better than to buy other companies and to pay goodwill.</p>
          <p>I never thought we'd get to a stage where we have free cash flow like this. And the other thing you are going to ask about Bernard and about Stanislas and how are we ever going to &#x2013; ever, ever going to replace Bernard.</p>
          <p>Now, Bernard was running Baume &amp; Mercier when I found him. And I thought he was a good manager. And I appointed him above the previous heads of Cartier's recommendations. In fact, at the board meeting yesterday, they all admitted that they had grave doubts.</p>
          <p>Now, Bernard is a very good manager, but Cartier sleeps in the vault, it's called Louis Cartier, and he's not going anywhere. We've been involved since 1975. The value of Cartier is its team. It's not an individual. Bernard will stay with us in a different role, but we do not have the hubris of some of the investment banks who think that we're irreplaceable. In any case, most of it's done by teams, including a central product and communication committee team where we stop things like putting &#x2013; no, we won't go there &#x2013; jewelry on gas bottle. We have brakes and accelerators built into the system.</p>
          <p>So the third question that I knew, I want to obviate all these things. What are you going to do about succession? It's in hand, including for me because I'm not going to work forever. I've had three stents put in my heart in the last month in New York. I feel great, but I'm going to also get out of here sometime. Yesterday was my 30th wedding anniversary and I was here alone, because I had to come and listen to your rubbish, your questions. My wife went to the Opera in London and I had to sit here because there is this Geneva Air Show, you can't get in and out. And I know the questions. When things going to happen in the next year. Each time they're growing.</p>
          <p>Baume &amp; Mercier we see it on breakeven. What's going to happen in fashion and luxury? Are you sure your succession is okay with Mr. Fornas? We are running a little poor on questions that you folks are going to ask. So please do not disappoint me because I have a list of questions and I expect to win. But very good luck, you're absolutely right. It was slightly more than five times.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johann. I'm sure that the message has been received loud and clear. So now, let's come back to the house and just speak about sales and sales in Europe first. We are now showing Middle East and Africa separately as they have different sales dynamics. Europe is our second largest region with 29% of Group sales. Sales in Western Europe rose by 16% overall. This rate primarily reflects organic growth of the any store openings. And this is mainly driven by tourism. Also, the French, German and Swiss clientele was fairly resilient.</p>
          <p>This growth also reflects the increased weight of Net-A-Porter and the fact that most Maison improved their performance versus a year ago on the period. Sales in Russia grew at a much faster rate than that in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Now, Middle East and Africa, this region accounts for 6% of Group sales. The largest part of sales are done in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Sales were primarily driven by locals purchasing high-end watches and jewelry. It's worth mentioning the increased weight of tourism, especially from China. High commodity prices should continue to bode well for the performance of the region, in particular, oil, gold, and diamond.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Asia Pacific that accounts for 42% of Group sales. This now remember once very small region. It's enjoyed broad-based growth. In terms of market, Macau, Hong Kong, and Mainland China performed best followed by Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. In term of channels, retail particularly solid, largely boosted by the opening of 61 stores in the region. The momentum was very good, including in the last quarter. Product wise , there is a trend towards higher price points. Given the demographics and economic momentum, the contribution to sales of the region should continue increasing.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the Americas region. It's growth rate is in line with last year, even if the comparisons were pretty challenging. The performance of Richemont in the USA reflects the quality of operations. Only 10 stores were opened over the period, so the retail growth is primarily organic. We start enjoying the benefits of a smaller, but more efficient wholesale network with less partners, but stronger partners and more partnership.</p>
          <p>The region performance was primarily driven by much higher jewelry sales and by domestic tourism. Purchases from visitors notably from Latin America and China are still low, but on the rise. Given the likely development of Latin America and easier access to visa for Chinese, we can expect South American and Chinese customers to become larger contributors to growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Now Japan, given its lower relative growth rate, Japan is now the fourth largest single market of Richemont with 9% of Group sales, after Hong Kong, USA and mainland China. It showed a remarkable resilience, even if the current challenges the country faces. It's worth mentioning the success of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and the Specialist Watchmakers and as well as the bridal lines. The solid performance doesn't change, however, our view that Japan is unlikely to achieve major growth in the future given its demographics.</p>
          <p>Let's look at sales by network. Retail sales enjoyed strong momentum, thanks to good performance at the Maison directly operated stores and Net-a-Porter, the impact of close to 100 net new internal stores primarily in Asia Pacific and tourist destinations. Wholesale growth was also broad-based in terms of regions. Inventory levels in the trade are sound. The Group now generates 53% of its sales through its internal stores.</p>
          <p>Here are the main points to remember about our Maisons performance this year. We got profitability and profit at the Jewellery Maisons. Robust profit at the Specialist Watchmakers. Improving profitability at Montblanc Maison. Fashion &amp; Accessories profitable and improving. Net-a-Porter, a year of structural expansion.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the main development within the Jewellery Maisons. Sales rose by a robust 32% above last year growth rate with few stores opening. Both Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels enjoy a broad-based double-digit growth in sales across the geographies, product lines and channels.</p>
          <p>Sales of high jewelry at Van Cleef &amp; Arpels were particularly noteworthy. Both Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels performed exceptionally well breaking new records. Operating contribution increased to &#x20AC;1.51 billion leading to a contribution margin of 33% of sales.</p>
          <p>Now, our Specialist Watchmakers. All our Maisons enjoys substantial growth in sales. Focused on the high-end segment of the watch industry, they each have their uniqueness, which implies little cannibalization and many synergies in back-office functions.</p>
          <p>Our Maisons pricing power and operating leverage helps to mitigate the strong Swiss franc and higher input costs. All Specialist Watchmakers improved &#x2013; saw an improvement in the results including Baume &amp; Mercier that reached break-even point. Operating contribution rose by 42% to &#x20AC;539 million and we were able to raise our contribution margin to 23%.</p>
          <p>We now turn to Montblanc. The 8% increase in sales was driven by watches and leather as well as by Asia-Pacific, Americas and the Middle East. Retail outperformed wholesale, reflecting the performance of the Asian internal stores and the ongoing downsizing of the wholesale network, mostly affecting pen distribution.</p>
          <p>Retail now account for 47 of Montblanc sales. The non-pen business, which includes watches, leathers and jewelry, offers a higher potential. It accounts now for 54% of Montblanc sales and this percentage is expected to grow in the future. Operating contribution rose by 9% to reach 16% of sales in line with last year.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Other business area, which comprises the Fashion and Accessories Maisons, Net-a-Porter, and the facilities involved in the production of watch components for the Group and third parties.</p>
          <p>First, the Fashion &amp; Accessories Maisons nearly doubled its profits from &#x20AC;29 million a year ago to &#x20AC;50 million. The performance of Alfred Dunhill was particularly strong. Chlo&#xE9; did well. The reorganization of design, retail and operation is now complete. Increased penetration of Asia-Pacific helped the Maison grow while the success of the perfume business is raising awareness and generating much free editorial. Lancel sales were quite strong. The repositioning is working and it is profitable on a recurring basis. The Net-a-Porter Group results were affected by investments in the UK and U.S. platforms. Its growth in sales remains above Group rates.</p>
          <p>Losses at the Group watch components manufacturing activities were contained to last year level. Going forward, as volume rise in tandem with expertise, we expect these losses to remain at similar level.</p>
          <p>Gary is now taking you through the P&amp;L. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We'll descend further down to earth now and talk about the finances. We enjoyed solid increase in sales as Richard and Mr. Rupert noted, 29% reported and 30% at constant rates. We enjoyed a 29% increase in gross margin in value terms. We contained our growth in operating expenses at 19% and all these elements led to an operating profit increase of 51% to &#x20AC;2.040 billion and an operating margin of 23%, which is truly remarkable.</p>
          <p>Let's get into the details now. Gross profit, the 29% value increase in gross profit generated a flat gross margin year-on-year at 63.7%. What were the positives? Our brands enjoyed again strong pricing power, higher retail prices, lower discount in our shops and higher selling prices to our wholesale partners. We had a higher retail mix contribution, which helped. We had volume related manufacturing efficiencies and we also benefited from our hedging program, which generated a &#x20AC;108 million gain in the margin line.</p>
          <p>These positives overcame a stronger Swiss franc, up 9% year-on-year. This obviously affects our production costs. We had higher precious material and higher input cost in terms of our products. Component prices also rose.</p>
          <p>We also had to overcome the natural economics of the Net-a-Porter business on gross margin as it's a different business model, so to the extent that their sales rise above the Group there's a dilution at the margin level.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you again that we announced in September that we were changing the accounting policy around our hedging program. Effective April 1, 2011, all of those contracts we did not &#x2013; we are not qualifying for hedge accounting. So, on the slide you see the effect going back each year of the old program in the margins. And when you sort of think about what you want to do in terms of projecting our margins going forward, you need to exclude that in future years. That gain or loss will now be below operating margins.</p>
          <p>Moving on to expenses. Our expenses rose by 19% or 18% in constant currency terms, well below the sales growth. The overall expense ratio declined to 41% from 44% a year ago. What with the increases for the year and the bridges on this slide for you, Net-A-Porter primarily to start off the full year of MR PORTER and expansion of UK facilities added 2% to our expense growth &#x2013; expense base.</p>
          <p>New boutiques accounted for 7% growth in spend. We had increased communication spend, which added 4%. And all other expenses, which are all other sales and distribution and administration expenses, added 5% to the base. And there was ForEx effects of 1%.</p>
          <p>S&amp;D costs 54% of total OpEx, rose by 19% given the strong sales growth and network expansion of 72 stores this year. Most of the stores were located in the Asia-Pacific region, but also in tourist destinations around the world. Administration costs were up 14% for the year, at constant currency terms 11%. The administration cost grew half the rate of sales. We developed the Asian backbone operations. We continue to expand Net-a-Porter, and we dealt with IT infrastructure issues as well.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to profit. Net profit, I'll deal with finance costs on the next slide, as is my usual way. We enjoyed an effective tax rate of 14.6%. The decrease in the rate versus the prior year is primarily due to deferred tax assets relating to inventories. This is more of a timing issue. There were more inventories in our subsidiaries at year-end than last year. So this accounts for about one point of the difference and is the largest difference.</p>
          <p>We expect a normalized tax rate going forward of 16% to 18%, and this range is very much within the cash tax range as well. Despite higher finance cost and the non-recurrence of the gain that we booked last year on the Net-a-Porter transaction, profit for the year rose by 43% to &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's take some look at the finance costs. We incurred non-cash losses on mark-to-market currency adjustments relating to our Eurobond funds amounting to &#x20AC;169 million in the period. As a reminder, upon consolidation, this has no effect on the Group's equity position.</p>
          <p>We talked about the hedging program, but I've tried to isolate for you on the new contracts the result of the hedging program for this year where we incurred a &#x20AC;26 million loss. If we had accounted for this under our old hedging policy, this would have been deferred in equity. We expect all remaining hedging contracts under the old program to be recycled in gross margin by August of this year. This, in fact, based on the rates in play at the end of the year is expected to be immaterial on the margin.</p>
          <p>Let's look at our cash flow, obviously, above last year due to our solid profit results. We did invest back in the business. We increased our inventories. Why? We were a little low last year. We talked about that. We opened up 72 new stores. Having said that, the inventory rotation continues to go down. This year it was 15.8 months versus 16.5 last year.</p>
          <p>We did see an increase in receivable balances as well, more to do with the wholesale business in the fourth quarter, and so that's an investment in a way. I'm pleased to say that receivable positions remained extremely healthy, this time last year, 90% of our receivables were current. That ratio has risen to 93% at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at our investments in capital expenditures. Our net investments on all capital-related items grew by 64% to &#x20AC;535 million. This represents 6% of sales. We had increased investments in manufacturing, we talked about the 72 new stores, and we expanded and improved our distribution platforms in Asia and Net-A-Porter UK. This level is obviously above depreciation and shows our commitment to our ongoing investment program. We will continue to rollout this investment program in retail with our wholesale partners at point of sale, and in manufacturing.</p>
          <p>The next slide I'm going to provide you with some details of some of the projects. By category, 47% of the investments related to the retail network. The most notable retail projects included new Cartier stores in Hangzou, in Seoul and the renovation of One Peking Road in Hong Kong. Van Cleef opened up a new home in the Prince's Building in Hong Kong and you see that on the slide. Piaget Galaxy in Macau, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Hong Kong Heritage, Panerai Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi, Vacheron Constantin in New York. And let's not forget as well, we renovated the Lancel flagship store in Paris.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that certainly breaking news. The remaining 26% of the spend went to distribution, our shared service facilities mostly in Asia and Net-a-Porter I discussed.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to free cash flow. Obviously, the higher cash flow from operations financed the capital investments that we just spoke about. And of course the better results caused us to pay higher taxes. Our cash tax rate for the year was 17.6%. In summary, free cash flow, while still healthy, declined a bit to &#x20AC;953 million for the year.</p>
          <p>A quick look at the balance sheet, our equity position rose to 73% of the total from 72% last year. After a cash payment of &#x20AC;204 million last year, we ended the year with net cash and investments of &#x20AC;3.2 billion, a &#x20AC;600 million increase versus last year.</p>
          <p>And finally from me, the dividend, our fiscal year 2012 dividend proposal to be confirmed by the shareholders in September is CHF0.55 per share. This proposed dividend represents a 22% increase over 2011 and it's consistent with our board's view, which aims to provide a consistently higher dividend each year. And Mr. Rupert already spoke about the approach there.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now I'd like to hand it back to Richard to talk about the operations.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary. Just a few comments on organizational highlights. Gary just disclosed our investments in retail infrastructure and production. These investments reflect our strategy of investing in our Maisons as explained by Mr. Rupert. As you just saw, we have significant internal investment opportunities with high returns.</p>
          <p>Let's start with distribution. New consumers from growth markets combined with massive tourism imply a major evolution of our distribution in established markets as well. So, best shopping experience is offered through our branded boutique.</p>
          <p>Today, our Maisons operates about 1,550 boutiques, some 90 more than last year. We continue to open selectively boutique including for our Specialist Watchmakers in growth markets and in established market in tourist destination taking into account notably more concentrated shopping patterns.</p>
          <p>However, for watches, the independent multi-brand retailers remain critical. We want to develop a stronger partnership with the ones remaining. This entails a larger business with key retailers, some with international expansion like Bucherer in Paris or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:14) in China. Greater control on sales and inventories by increased integration in our own supply chain, increased productivity for the retailers enabling a higher margin for us.</p>
          <p>To support our distribution strategy in new markets, we are structuring our distribution platforms. Further, platform in Hong Kong and China are now fully separated. Both markets are indeed of critical size to justify their own organization. In China where we face huge growth head count will rise from 2,300, end of March 2012 to some 4,000 my March 2015 of which over 400 people to service some expected 300,000 watches a year.</p>
          <p>We also recently opened our Retail Academy in Shanghai to recruit and train our sales force. Today, we manage over 160 internal stores in China. In three years' time, the number could reach over 250. In Hong Kong and China, we are opening offices and warehouses to enable the development of the Net-a-Porter Group. In Brazil, a new Richemont affiliate will incorporate the Watch and Jewellery Maisons by mid-2013.</p>
          <p>In India, a new Richemont affiliate should open this year to prepare for the future. We continue to promote operational efficiencies through distribution platforms and ERP to benefit from a fully integrated system from design to retail, including supply chain with our wholesale partners.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to manufacturing. Our philosophy is based on verticalization, i.e., each Maison has its dedicated manufacturing facilities to guarantee authenticity. Our biggest country in terms of head count for manufacturing is Switzerland, mainly for watches, then come Germany and France. Over our 37 fully controlled manufacturing facilities and workshops, we employ close to 7,000 people around a quarter of our 25,000 workforce.</p>
          <p>We continue our investment in watch and jewelry manufacturing by strategy, as explained. As a result, we raised authenticity to meet clients' requirement, for example, through movement manufacturing. We enhanced our flexibility to meet demand in a volatile environment. You saw the capacity of that efficient to the demand of Cartier. We raised the capacity to meet increased demand and future growth and, of course, we improved operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Current investments include new and extended watch manufacturing facilities in Switzerland for Cartier, Officine Panerai, Vacheron Constantin. Extended jewelry workshop for Cartier and Louis-Francois in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>The Piaget Campus Genevois de Haute Horlogerie is also one of the major investments to come. The entire watch making industry suffers from the lack of qualified manpower. We have invested in specialized school, but needed to get on a bigger scale and be more appealing toward the young generation. The campus has a watchmaking school, research and development center and new manufacturing facilities for several of Maison, including our manufacturer, Stern, specialized in dials and specialized movement components.</p>
          <p>Thank you, I would like to hand the presentation back to Mr. Rupert for the conclusion.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard and thank you, Gary. I think we went &#x2013; gone through the same topics year after year and our strategy really remains the same. What matters most is the protection of the heritage of the Maisons. As we've said before, we're really in a business where we can wreck our own businesses. Mr. Buffet always talks about a moat around your business. Well, there's a big moat around a very well-run luxury goods business. I'm not going to wake up one day and find out that somebody has found a new way. Imagine if you're IBM and you're making computers and Dell comes around. And then after Dell, Gateway comes around and in the end you're going to put down and you see they're all made in the same factory.</p>
          <p>The basic drivers for the quality goods business and the word luxury is so banal. But once somebody's worn a cashmere product, it's kind of odd to go back to lambswool. Yes, you may have to go back for a few years if your cash flow is insufficient, but you always treasure that dream. So &#x2013; and this I never believed, <mark type="ph" /> Joe (51:41) we explained to me, he said that once you've tasted it, there is that drive for fine products.</p>
          <p>Now, a friend of mine defined luxury is that something that you never really knew that you needed, you never missed it. And then, once you got used to it, you couldn't do without it. But you never realized that you needed it. But once you got used to it, and it became a habit, you couldn't do without it.</p>
          <p>Now, that need will remain. Love, passion, guilt, gift-giving, self-reward, it's been millennia, and it will continue. It's how we look after the Maisons that we have. And we're going to continue to invest in the creativity, in the dedicated workshops, manufacturing facilities. And then on the demand side, we're continuing to work on the desirability and the prestige and the esteem, communicate.</p>
          <p>Now you know we have to reinforce our European heritage, and we've got to make clear what 'made in Switzerland' is. Now, I agree with Mr. Hayek. It's total sense that you're going to export movements to Hong Kong and there is a company that buys movements from him, export to Hong Kong, sell it to Chinese manufactures who put it into cases and puts straps and stuff on, and then sell it as made in Switzerland against Swatch. It's nonsense. So, we've got to make clear what is 'made in Switzerland.'</p>
          <p>And then, we've got to maximize our business model. We've got to leverage distribution, real estate and training. And for those of you who are here who are colleagues of mine and Thomas, you can do me the favor by sending out an e-mail to the heads of all the Maisons tomorrow that they will now be in negative KPI of 30% at my judgment on any Maisons head who is overly aggressive in the competition with another company inside the Richemont Group. Because when we negotiate for a boutique on Madison Avenue, quite toughly, and I find out that another Richemont company goes through another route and concedes on terms that Richard and I signed off and say, hang on, we want it. That is 30%. And you know the message. You know whom I'm talking about. They're not too far away from here.</p>
          <p>If we want to leverage on the system that we so painfully built, then really let's not do that. And by saying it here and I know a lot of the Maisons are listening over this telecast. I'm talking to you folks. Stop messing around with your colleagues. It makes me and Richard look like fools as well.</p>
          <p>Our objectives are still the same, building goodwill rather than acquiring goodwill. And ultimately, it is &#x2013; all of this is in the pursuit &#x2013; in the generation of sustainable free cash flow because once we've &#x2013; once we're able to do that then we can grow dividends consistently. I think we've spoken about at constant currencies, April's up 20% and it's up 29%, as reported.</p>
          <p>Folks, I'm not &#x2013; they beg me my colleagues, please don't say it, but I feel like I'm having a black tie dinner on top of a volcano. Okay. That volcano is China, but that's what I feel like. I go in the morning, we put on our ties and our watches and we go. And the food's better and the wine's better and the weather is great. But let's not kid ourselves, there is a volcano somewhere whether it's this year, in 10 years' time or in 20 years' time. We are exposed to China.</p>
          <p>I think they're going to travel more, I think they're going to survive, I think all of these things. But we all know the China play. And it suits us if the euro gets weaker. It's everything that I would never have thought 10 years ago, but that really is our business. Personally, I don't think anything is going to go wrong in China, that's my view. But I know nothing and I mean it. I may be too optimistic about China.</p>
          <p>But if you have differing views, remember, it's critical. In facing the future, over the last 25 years, with both a very strong Group of Maisons and especially in the East authenticity, originality and history matters, you don't create these three overnight. We have leadership on a number of prestige products and categories.</p>
          <p>We have enormous growth in the countries with the money. We have a very sound balance sheet. So, I am long in this company and I'm still believing. But I've got to give you a counter balance that if I'm wrong on China, we're going to have issues.</p>
          <p>Personally, it's funny my friends in New York all ask me, so what's happening in China? What's happening in China? What's happening in China? Not necessarily because they're interested in Richemont. But they're interested in their own wealth there because they are equity and in credit markets, people like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:00). All he wants to know what's happening in China.</p>
          <p>Well, what's happening for us in China is good news. But understand that if we're wrong, it will have implications. But, by the way, then it will be too ghastly to contemplate for all of us because believe me, it will be every single large company.</p>
          <p>I think we've been as forthright as we can. And I'll sit now and then if you want to have any questions we'll answer them. But I'm not going to tell you what I think our third quarter's XYZ is going to be. And, by the way, neither will my colleagues. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Oh, and by the way, this is not a bribe. So you can tell Deutsche Bank. No? You can. And then if Deutsche Bank cannot have that, then you have a real problem with your ethics.</p>

          <p>Johann, congratulations on a terrific set of numbers and the result of lots of hard work. And it sounds like a long time ago, but in your estimation where do you have the highest returns on your cash flow &#x2013; your capital expenditures going forward? Where will the investments returns be the greatest if you think about your Maisons, your flagship stores, whether it's in China, generally, whether it's in travel retail? What are the areas? You've touched upon this question so often that's why you may not have much left but just your priority?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends upon &#x2013; are you asking in which geographic area or which company or which combination of company plus geographic area? Or where we've over-priced our product so ridiculously that the cash flow is superb?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, it's sort of a broader question. You'll be able to continue to redeploy capital and you've seen it go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've said already that you're going to be increasing your capital spending. So rather than beat that drum because eventually &#x2013; well, let me switch the question. You once had a great observation about counterfeit and what measures you take to try to police it and go against it, and also what it did internally to your organization to help make it more urgent in its own production practices. So maybe just reflect on that for a moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's very difficult because we generally find this a very long-term business. Currently, because of currency movements, et cetera, Japan is still our most profitable market because of the pricing and how the yen has moved. And it's been one of our most profitable markets for very, very, very, very many years, Gary. But I guess our single most profitable venture is probably Panerai where we paid less than $1 million. We found 43 Rolex movements, which we cleaned and oiled. We put it into platinum watches, and we sold for more than the purchase price. But that don't come that often.</p>
          <p>But I would say Van Cleef would be a very good &#x2013; Van Cleef would be a good example of how our business model works where &#x2013; actually it was a Mr. Corrado Fratini of Italy who put the company together. And we had had an interest. I then bought the company from him over the phone. No one was with him, but we shook hands over the phone.</p>
          <p>And one of our large competitors based in Paris offered him 25% more than what we'd agreed upon over the phone without asking what we'd agreed upon. And Mr. Fratini said, "Sorry, I'm a gentlemen, I've agreed." And that's how we got Van Cleef &amp; Arpels. And that's more than a decade ago. But slowly, doing all the right things, getting, pulling the licenses back, getting the leases, getting the products, going into the archives, getting the artisans back, today, it is a very profitable company.</p>
          <p>But I remember coming year after year, and not only you folks but colleagues of mine at the board level, so when exactly going to make money. You remember how often? I said when we're ready for it to make money, board members. Alan, you remember how many years. Finally, I took it off the board table. I said it will make money and we'll let you know. Today, it is a very precious part of our Group sales. Tell me it's a difficult call. You are correct. The real question is do companies redeploy their free cash flow accretively or they do they waste it. And if that's your question, fully agree.</p>
          <p>There are lot of companies who actually waste their free cash flow and they reinvest it sub-optimally and if you find the companies that redeploy their free cash flow properly and at a higher rate, then you get that generational tag. I haven't worked out which is the past, which ones in the past. I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I add also that you need a vision because when you bought LMH...</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will never be there today if we have not bought LMH.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was not my vision. That was my paranoia of what would happen. I think if you want to be successful you need a very healthy dose of paranoia that somewhere every day somebody is there that wants to eat your breakfast, and if you're not there, they will do so.</p>
          <p>So LMH, if we hadn't done that &#x2013; that's 12 years ago, if we hadn't done that we wouldn't have had a business. But for that I have to thank my French friends, Mr. Jean-Marie Messier hadn't the grand vision of building Vivendi, he wouldn't have bought us up at CHF68 &#x2013; &#x20AC;68. The share went to &#x20AC;8. So if we hadn't had that cash, we hadn't exited out of Pay-TV, we wouldn't have had the cash to buy LMH. And if we hadn't bought LMH, we wouldn't have been in the business today because it would have been like making Ferraris in Fiat factories. You cannot do it.</p>
          <p>Our clients are too sophisticated. They want authenticity, and with the transparency that the Web brings, I mean you can't lie to clients. And if you have superior quality &#x2013; I always say to people, trademark is not some mysterious thing. What a trademark is WYSIWYG, what you see is what you get. If I buy this I'm not expecting Ch&#xE2;teau Lafite. I'm not expecting &#x2013; I'm expecting Touc. And it better be the same every time I buy it. And if you buy a watch, it's not that you buy high or low or this, but it's got to be consistent. And what the client expects, the lady or the gentleman, it must exceed their expectations, at least meet. So trademarks across the world &#x2013; a trademark is not such a funny thing. And so we need that consistency, and it's in the end attention to detail.</p>
          <p>A paranoia, and that's why I love Ralph Lauren so much. We're actually not quite sure who is more paranoid, him or me. Okay. When we sit down and we start talking about what could go wrong, and this goes into the early morning. So a healthy paranoia is not bad. But the real question that you asked, and I'm afraid that's the key question, that 99% of all people knows. It's no good generating free cash flow if you reinvest it at less than the rate that you're generating at that. As simple as that. Then rather give all your cash to your shareholders.</p>
          <p>Sorry, but I have to admit, quite often when we've calculated that it would be a more than optimal return, it's turned into a bloody disaster, and quite often, it's your gut feel that's led to a higher net optimum. It's very often of group of us sitting around and saying, "We smell something." You know, how to define that. You know what I'm saying.</p>
          <p>With Panerai, my colleagues tell me that I'm going to freak on but no taste. Okay. So, don't buy it. What they wrote to me, that I'm unsophisticated, yes, but I didn't write to them that I have more shares, so we are all buying it.</p>

          <p>Jon, we're comfortable right now and told you last year and the year before that we're comfortable.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as part of that question, I can see you're obviously doing a lot of expansion in your manufacturing capacity, Cartier expansion and lots of watchmakers. Would it be realistic to expect then that it will be some margin pressure on the Watch division as you expand your own production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've said that for the last five years. Obviously, there would be, but there'll be a blend between owned and others then there is no headline in this or any story in this. It's an evolving situation. We don't where it's going to lead because there are enough movements inside Switzerland, but when people export 800,000 Swiss-made movements to Hong Kong. And then call those watches wrist watches then I have empathy with IX. I mean it's rubbish. If those 800,000 were to be here, there wouldn't be a problem. So, it's &#x2013; I'm not going to go down there because every question leads to another headline and Rupert says this and then this is that. We are comfortable.</p>
          <p>We're comfortable with our costing. And we're comfortable with a blended cost. What's more important, our clients are comfortable with that. And we have a good relationship with the other manufacturers, with Rolex, with the Swatch group. We don't really have enemies in the watchmaking universe here. And I want to just keep it like that. And our plans are in place. They have been in place for a while and if I can put it to you like this, there is no story here. There might have been a story three or four years ago, if things have gone wrong and your hunch is incorrect, it would have blown that cost out of the water. As things stand now, I'm very &#x2013; I mean I'm comfortable, Richard. But you should say to you there the production.</p>

          <p>Yes. What's also important to know that the market has evolved towards higher price points, meaning that the in-house movement, which of course cost more than standard movement, has just met the evolution of the demand. So &#x2013; and you saw and translated into figures. So, here we are.</p>

          <p>Well, it's just a question on the deployment of your resources as it were. On M&amp;A, it's pretty clear you have a fantastic portfolio in the hard luxury segment with the Jewellery and the Specialist Watchmakers. But maybe, potentially some of the soft leather accessories are sub-optimal and maybe that's part of the problem with the profitability. Is it time to look around some businesses within the sort of soft leather and accessory side? It doesn't have to be a big bang acquisition but...?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They all think they're worth 20 times what they are. Okay. I mean, I get two a week household names, but a lot of these were bought by financial institutions, are now wishing to exit. And they came in the other way around. I went into Italy and actually spoke to the supplier five, six years ago. And I looked at it from the supplier up and I did and there's one very big, well, acquisition. I got to a realistic price being 40% of the eventual price. You can't compete. And then you're in that business, ready-to-wear business, and then you've got ZARA and H&amp;M.</p>
          <p>But I've got news for ZARA. In China, they're being ZARA. Yes, because they want, the same people want us into some of their big malls. ZARA always had a pref. They'll come in, they know down payments, no minimums and the big Chinese mall operators said no. They have people that are quicker than you. So now it's this intermediations, it's like Dell, and then Gateway. If you're selling other &#x2013; sooner or later, if you're selling copies of other people's products, which essentially is their business model, then sooner or later somebody's going to do it quicker than you. And do I want to be in that business? Ready to wear? They go to runways, take pictures, send it to China, get the factories moving, ship them. By the time your stuff gets on the runway, it's too old and too expensive. Seems to me like a bad business model. Accessory is a different business.</p>
          <p>But a lot of the companies that are for sale today were bought by the non-industry players at the height of the boom, and they still haven't realized that they lost their money three years ago. They lost the money when they paid it, okay? It's this thing in the <mark type="ph" /> hour (01:20:21) and we all do it. You make a dumb buy. I've done it a lot of times, and when I went to sell it, I think, geez I've lost a lot of money. No, I didn't lose a lot of money when I'm trying to sell it. I lost the money when I was idiotic in the pursuit when I bought the bloody thing. That's when you park your money. It's not when you try and find a bigger idiot than you to take it off your hands. So a lot of these things that are available were bought at the wrong prices. And it's there &#x2013; and I know, we all know the same companies. And it's of no interest to us at this stage.</p>

It doesn't matter what company in the world.</p>
          <p>So, if you have like Mr. Buffet said, you build moats, you build brand equity, you can withstand quite a lot of stupid things that we ourselves do. I'm not worried that somebody who is in another luxury goods company is going to think of something and that's going kill our business.

          <p>I mean, Patrik, I think maybe just on the stores question. Mr. Rupert at the half year talked about our planning process and how we go through the strategic plans and how &#x2013; all the brands come and there's a difference between want and need. And we opened up 72 stores this year, you see the CapEx for the retail. The overall value of the retail will be down versus this year. That doesn't mean that the store count will be down because there's a change in the mix. There's a bit more allocated this year to the Fashion &amp; Accessories model because they've doubled their profits as you've seen. The product pipeline seems to be good. So I can't really equate a number for you in terms of percentage, but because a watch and jewelry store is smaller than, say, a Chlo&#xE9; store or what have you.</p>
          <p>I think on the value of CapEx, we used to give ranges. I don't necessarily want to do that. I'd rather give you a number, including manufacturing from our bottom up approach and that's about &#x20AC;750 million, which is pretty consistent with what we're talking about here.</p>

          <p>You can see how these Maisons evolve, and they start getting a critical mass. In certain of them if you do &#x20AC;50 million, it's a lot harder to get from zero or from &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;200 million. And it is from &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;600 million. From &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;1 billion is a lot easier than from &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;200 million. And it's to get them to that critical mass. That's why the big visibility in negotiations with retail, with landlord, we need to get two or three of our Maisons to build muscle, and we are hiring as well some people outside. And we think we're in a nice position that we have the liquidity to do so. But both of you very good questions, but your questions are the things that made me lie awake at night. That's why we remain very close to our opponent.</p>

          <p>It's growing quicker than our Group rate, but slower than they used to. We are not quite sure whether it is because they bought in the expectation of bigger sales is how do you buy &#x2013; you buy upon the history.

          <p>Hi. Francesca Di Pasquantonio, Deutsche Bank. I have a question on China and I appreciate it's quite difficult to predict what can happen to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:31:39). But it would be interesting to understand what you're seeing today in terms of the behavior of customers in response to the current economic uncertainties to the current uncertainties on the political situation side, whether what you're seeing is basically influencing the way you are planning for this year and whether maybe recent changes have shifted a little bit your mindset to be slightly more cautious on the next, let's say 12-18 months. Any color you could give on that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cautious optimism. Firstly, when you look at China, you have to look at &#x2013; especially on a segment, you have to look at sales in China and sales to Chinese outside of China and especially in Asia-Pacific. You saw the figures for Asia-Pacific, so far so good. The problem is prediction. We don't know. But we are following and we're saying that on a daily business, we are a retailer so we know what's going on. We pay attention. We think that the substance for future growth is still there. But we're paying attention to what's going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Chinese consumers are sophisticated. They were civilized, inventing gun powder, steel when our forefathers ran around with loincloths in the caves, they have an aberration for a while mainly western imported philosophies. They're sailing, they stuck, they're working. They will have material wealth.</p>
          <p>So, up to them we have no problem. However, in every centrally commanded economy, you have the potential for a hiccup. Suddenly, they put strict border control. Suddenly they do this, suddenly they do that. I don't know. But in the free market system, you have a CIO that blows a minimum of &#x20AC;2 billion in a week saying how can we fill the time. He said their banking system doesn't work. I don't know.</p>
          <p>It will not be the Chinese consumer that's on the work. It could be an exogenous factor, but I can't see, but the consumers have the sophistication and the desire for our products. So, all of that is in very good shape, and if they're allowed to travel and they will get disposable income, then this could be the start. If that is &#x2013; that's my gut feel. I might be totally wrong.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The CapitaLand people &#x2013; remember it's Singaporean-based basically started by my hero, Lee Kuan Yew. And very interesting how they put it. They said, well, we have to get consumption up to 30%. That means this; we can't sell televisions and stoves in mom-and-pop shops. For that we need malls. So, we're going to need that mini-malls by 2018, okay? Right, and we're going to build 200. There's one is 223,000 square meters. I mean, 223,000 in Chongqing, okay? And by the way, that's only part of the development. They're building 200 airports in China at the moment, and how long have they been fighting about the defrosted runway. I mean, 30 years. Okay. Where do you want to be? Just to have a look at the people working.</p>
          <p>I mean, two days ago, my son and I flew here and because of the stupid air show, we had to get up at 3:00, fly at 3:30. Actually, no, we flew at 4:30 from the UK. There was nobody. No, I'm lying. Up <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:37:10) Road, there were some Pakistanis, and other Muslims washing their feet, they were up. They were working. There wasn't a single white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, no Englishman was awake. They were sleeping, maybe coming back from the night before.</p>
          <p>However, if you had to drive around at 4:30 in Shanghai or for that matter in New York, the city is alive. People are working. And I'm crazy, but I look at those things. Actually go look at the economic activity. And I'm excited. I want to go to Myanmar, Vietnam. These are cultured people, highly-cultured people. They are coming out of semi-slavery. They work. Those that are already studying and that's what makes me optimistic.</p>
          <p>And, yes, there will be hiccups. There will be repression. There will be &#x2013; but as a society, what do you want to bet? Francesca, do you really think the Greeks didn't think that they were going to run? I'm not talking to these guys now, talking about Athens, Sparta. Do you think they didn't think they're going to run the world forever? Or the Romans?</p>
          <p>Do you really think the Romans thought that the Empire or the people that ran our country, Great Britain? We discovered diamonds. They come and steal it. We discovered gold. They come and steal it. 1880, 1890, turn on the last century, 200,000 Brits, we were 20,000. They killed 10%, the women and children. Do you really think that in the year 1902 that Great Britain thought the sun was ever going to set on the Empire?</p>
          <p>No way. And I'm afraid unless America gets its act together then you're going to go and read that book by David Halberstam on the American Century, great book because it may be the last book that you read about an American century in comparison to the work ethic. And now we discussed it earlier and I mean Europe, I love Europe. But I mean are these folk serious?</p>
          <p>Fifty-odd workweek. And I want to retire at 50, full pension, full medical and, by the way, the whole of February, sorry, of May is abridged. I'm bridging this to bridging that to bridging that. And if you got a factory, you can't run a factory with half your people on a bridge somewhere, but I will now have growth.</p>
          <p>I happen to know the people from the CIC, Gao, and GIC. They're highly sophisticated. They're not going to buy these bonds. In their words, why should I buy debt from people who work less than me and are not planning to repay me?</p>
          <p>So this is really &#x2013; these are the kinds of conversations we have around our board. Normally, a red wine-fueled dinner the night before the board meeting is when strategy is set. Where Richard and our board and Gary &#x2013; Gary will say, this is an issue and then we look. Will the euro remain? It's a kind of interesting question. Will all of the member states in the euro still be there in this euro in two years' time? I'm willing to take a bet, no. Okay. Because Alan Grieve knows that when it was started, I said the euro won't last 20 years. Where's Alan &#x2013; Alan?</p>
          <p>Somewhere, please go and find it in our board minutes. And you know why? I'm foreigner here, but I can't see how people who have different work ethics can have the same productivity. If you don't have the same productivity, how can you have the same currency for a long time? And I'm not saying that the people in <mark type="ph" /> Barry (01:42:33) and in &#x2013; the whole of the south of Spain. Yes, if I'm <mark type="ph" /> Mayor Kino (01:42:45), why do I want to work like somebody in Hamburg? He's got to be mad. I mean it's cold and freezing and raining. Now do you think this is a diversion? Unless you think like this, you're not going to understand our Group. This is how we think and this is how we think about currencies and that leads back to our positions that we take.</p>
          <p>Sorry, there was &#x2013; is that &#x2013; there were two or three more questions. Yes, sorry. Yes, please. Just speak up.</p>

          <p>Certainly, last year, we were pretty opportunistic because of the Swiss franc and took significant pricing. We don't see that this year. We don't see that this year so, every brand does it differently, so I can't really give you a number from a Group standpoint. Some are taking some, some are not. Some are only taking some in Europe, but it's muted this year. It's not featuring I would say on the radar.</p>

          <p>We will never comment upon price increases again. I had a fit last year. I mean you tell people you're going to take a price increase, you give them the margin away. I mean I'm going to charge you more next week, but I'm open to buy. You just call in one day and say the prices have gone up, but the currencies have been more stable and yet now we didn't &#x2013; the first quarter was not really impacted by price increases.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And on the retail question, I think Mr. Rupert always says we have to find the pockets where the money in the pockets are. So we tend to be opportunistic, projects come and go, so we don't really target a percentage, per se.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. Sorry, I have a question again on the manufacturing. Are you happy with the development of other group's offering you movements and assortments? And has the quality and quantity involved the way you expected over the last several months available for you in the market or you might have to do more in terms of verticalization with your brands? And the brands you mentioned thus where you pushed the verticalization very hard, is that &#x2013; does it mean you're 100% independent and produce every little component yourself?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question, last question is, Mr. Rupert, you talked about brakes and accelerators you built into the Group over the last several years. Can I ask you where your foot is at the moment between these two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I didn't catch half of it. If you speak into the microphones, could just hold it a bit away from your mouth please, because if you speak right into it, we can't hear. Sorry, it's &#x2013; thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding factoring and manufacturing, we told you we are comfortable. We are investing and, of course, we are monitoring the evolution of the landscape. It's clear that there is less and less in the balance suppliers. And on top, we are becoming, how we say, not so big, but we are becoming sizable and meaning that some small independent suppliers are no longer big enough to cope with our demand. So we are forced to integrate including assortments. That's very clear that we have developed our own source of production in assortments and we are comfortable with that.</p>
          <p>Sorry, and the second question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second questions was about &#x2013; you said you're building brakes and accelerators into the Group over the last 20 years. Can I ask you where your foot is at the moment between these two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary's foot is always on the brake. And he's done a hell of job by keeping it on the brake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, seriously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. And he's got a hand brake on as well. Sometimes, Richard and I push him to let go of the hand brake. Then we've got colleagues, the head of every Maisons whose foot is always on the accelerator. Okay. Assume that if we had &#x20AC;15 billion, we said go for it, they'll find a way to spend it in three years. Trust me.</p>
          <p>So, it's &#x2013; I think the real issue is what Mr. Rousseau is we will not let go of the accelerator or we will not let go of the brake unless we see that it will, in terms of cash generation and returns, be better than alternate decisions. And sometimes like with LMH 12 years ago, we bet a lot of money. We went and borrowed money, but we knew we had to do it. So, if a situation presents itself like where there is something that you know you have to do, then we will be bold enough to do it. But we will know that in a three to five-year period, it will be cash accretive.</p>
          <p>But it's a good question. Then you should actually ask it of the guys who are not here. Okay. The guys you report to &#x2013; direct report to them. Get Georges Kern sit here next year. Where's your foot, Georges? Problem is Georges doesn't have a brake. Okay. I don't think IWC is got a break in its business model, but they're doing very, very, very well. But our goal is to temper irrational exuberance.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. It's John Guy from Berenberg. A couple of questions please with regards to Net-a-Porter. First of all, I just wanted to get an update as to MR PORTER's sales evolution and where that stands as a percentage of net sales. And also with regards to your evolution and potential investment in distribution platforms in Asia, with regards to Net-a-Porter, could you maybe tell us where you are with that?</p>
          <p>I know within the statement, it was &#x20AC;400 million or over &#x20AC;400 million of sales for the Net-a-Porter. Are we closer to &#x20AC;401 million or &#x20AC;499 million or somewhere in the middle? And how many brands are now being sold through the Net-a-Porter business?</p>
          <p>And I guess one final, sorry, quite a few here but one final on the additional &#x20AC;250 million of CapEx guide that you didn't know about. With regards to the U.S., are you going to elaborate on that please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not going to elaborate because the other side don't know about it yet. In fact, if we elaborate it, it may become &#x20AC;280 million. No. Net-a-Porter, I think we've got to back to the history of Net-a-Porter. And it's interesting. Natalie's husband, Arnaud Massenet helped Elva <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:52:02) and myself, get out of that French trap that we found ourselves with Canal, Vivendi, et cetera. He worked at Lehman and after a rather unfortunate meeting in Paris, I said to Elva, I don't trust these guys, Vivendi. Let's get out.</p>
          <p>We had &#x2013; you know what a super class 1 transaction is in the UK. You can't deal with a company. It's totally non-French. Okay. But normally where we come from, controlling shareholders or substantial shareholders done deal with public companies or companies. And if ever you should, you get total third-party advice. I have never dealt with any company publicly. I don't even buy secondhand car from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:53:13) or Richemont or Rembrandt or any &#x2013; you have church and state. You have the company, which belongs to your constituents and then I have my own assets and we don't mingle it.</p>
          <p>And I'm going to go back because you're going to understand, then Vivendi bought Path&#xE9; whilst we were co-investors in Canal and all the media was supposed to go through Canal+. We were in Tokyo, I think, for a board meeting when I read this. And I see this movie.</p>
          <p>Now, they're going to try to move Path&#xE9; into Canal for more shares to dilute us. I've seen this movie before. It's got French subtitles and I've seen it. And Elva assured me that having written the articles, everything adopted, which Vivendi agreed to, we inserted into the articles, basically, British corporate governance.</p>
          <p>So we're in a meeting and the great and the good and all the bankers that later on had hiccups in their banks with fabulous fab, et cetera, all these guys sat there somberly and I said, "Look, we've got an agreement. I'm going to appoint an international investment bank to give a fairness opinion according to the rules."</p>
          <p>And the answer was, "Sorry, Tr&#xE9;sor has approved it." I said, "Excuse me, this is a major company." Canal. Vivendi is a major company. We have an agreement, signed by both boards, three major boards, not yet a year old. You cannot act like this. This is not serious.</p>
          <p>Tr&#xE9;sor has approved. Sorry, and it was true. Tr&#xE9;sor had approved it. And I said to Jean-Marie this is not serious and <mark type="ph" /> Daniel Buitoni (01:55:39) was also there. I said you are serious businessmen? What do you the rest of the world thinks of France? Now, this is a place that I love. So I got up. I walked out. I said to Elva, we're getting out. But we're in a year lock-up. So I called Lehman and I said, "Okay, get us out." So they sold it out and it was Natalie's husband, Arnaud Massenet, who got us out at &#x20AC;68 and I banked it.</p>
          <p>And there's a lot of money for us. Okay. And this is over 12, 13 years ago and I was told it is a mistake and the price is going to go up. And to my absolute horror, it did go up to &#x20AC;80 and even more horror, I bumped into Jean-Marie in an elevator in New York, and he says, "Yes, I told you this is a mistake." That's why I said God damn it.</p>
          <p>However, on the year of the anniversary, on the date, it was eight, eight. Lucky for Chinese, for me, very bad. Eight. And the guy who did it was Arnaud Massenet, and Arnaud's wife was Natalie. And she started &#x2013; and I'm telling you this whole story so you can understand how we got involved in it. She started this business.</p>
          <p>And my big concern and all of our concern's always been clicks and bricks, clicks and mortar, is it going to go online, if it goes online and our clients love online, then we don't have assets. Then we've got liabilities worldwide. Every single boutique is a liability.</p>
          <p>So she asked us to be a key investor, originally. Elva took a few shares with my permission and we took some shares and angel investors, but I didn't really wanted for many reasons make to begin investment because we would have killed the business with all of our corporate governance and corporate social responsibility and she would have had to file 50 reports with Alan Grieve about whether the baton was made in Bangladesh and whether the gold came out of clean mining and none of the stuff that we know but &#x2013; so, I said keep it independent.</p>
          <p>Then the second round came and we put some more money in &#x2013; but I didn't said we like the right to first refusal because I don't want to be party to building this thing up and when it's successful, one of our opponents buys it.</p>
          <p>Then the Hearst Corporation approached them to make a bid. And her one partner, <mark type="ph" /> Buscay (01:59:11) who made a lot of money, a lady very smartly sold, but that triggered our pre-emptive. We did not go and say we want to buy, but we got triggered and frankly, it should have been bought by either Hearst or Cond&#xE9; Nast. Because in the medium term, if you look at iPads, yes, it's a slow uptake but &#x2013; I don't know how many of you read now on newsreader that there's some apps here, newsreader and Zinio where you read the magazine online, but not this rubbish website, you read the proper New York Times or proper FT, you flip it and the whole paper is there.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at the print cost, and if you look at some of the technology that's coming in three to five years' time, people are going to be reading Harper's online and Vanity Fair, but not just the website. It's going to be properly online. So, if it grows slower than we suspected, then Richard and Gary and a few people, if it grows by 40% to 50% to 60%, they may be a bit disappointed. I will be very happy because it's not a big part of our business and it basically means that our clicks and bricks and our mortar-driven business is still going well.</p>
          <p>I would have been petrified if this was growing at 150% per year like this. And that hard goods store is selling there. That watches and jewelry had to go online because that, gentlemen, ladies, would have meant that Bond Street, Rodeo Drive, Fifth Avenue, Montenapoleone, those things have become liabilities.</p>
          <p>I mean, if you &#x2013; this is highly likely to be my very last time that I'm ever sitting here. So I want to just give you our philosophy. To me, this is a hedge with the best lady, with the best team, and if they're cash flow positive and they learn and MR PORTER is doing well, but, hopefully, your waist size is not 40 like me because then it is of no use. It seems to be that American and South African men are just too big for online shopping. Look at them laugh.</p>
          <p>Actually, if you want to see something funny, really funny, my son and I doing the Mille Miglia, but I've got two very close friends who are doing it with us and they are driving a 1956 Ford Thunderbird. Now, these two people are both ex-rugby players. Their combined weight is approximating 300 kilogram and we had to take the hard top off so they can drive with goggles looking over the windscreen. So over the next three days, and they can't buy clothes anywhere.</p>
          <p>But they were so hopeful with Net-a-Porter. They said, there's nothing on it, not even a t-shirt but Net-a-Porter to us is a great learning curve. It's not costing us money. Its cash flow is fine. We think that is going to be one of the survivors in what's becoming an increasingly crowded space. In fact, we know it'll be one of the survivors. But space is getting increasingly crowded. But to me, I look at it as a huge learning experience because they have fulfillment capabilities and what they've got is state-of-the-art. But it's a very good question, but it's not critical to our &#x2013; critical to us is Cartier, and in the future, and our Watch business and in the future Van Cleef and Piaget.</p>
          <p>Last question?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Coulter from Nomura. First question, really, is around emerging markets. You mentioned in the presentation, South Africa, Nigeria, others you talked about South America or India. How important or how excited are you about those markets and practically on a five to ten-year view, how would you seek to enter those markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll start with India. India is a federal state, and each of those 50 states, all of their customs officials are underpaid and rely upon another form of income. It is a bureaucratic nightmare. A wonderful country with wonderful people, but zero infrastructure. Highly sophisticated people and our strategy really has been to keep the brands and the Maisons top of the mind awareness but, to, for instance, communicate on &#x2013; let's take Emirates here, flies into five Indian cities daily, hub Abu Dhabi &#x2013; sorry, Dubai.</p>
          <p>Now, you don't really want to fly domestic Chinese and Indian airlines. If you see Emirates, try to take Emirates when you're leaving &#x2013; you know what I'm saying. Okay. And if we are well represented there and well represented in Dubai and now in Abu Dhabi and when they come to London because the Indians would tend to come to London more because of historic reasons, cultural reasons, speak English.</p>
          <p>South Africa's tiny. Nigeria, tiny. However, some brands we are going in. For instance, Montblanc. Montblanc could do incredibly well there and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:07:22). It is funny as an African that I was asked by some people in our treasury what I thought of some European credits and whether we had to extend credits to some sovereign states in Europe and I thought what names from 10 years ago that a South African should opine on which European states should not be extended credit to. South Africa is doing very well, very, very well. The Central Bank and the Treasury have run their business quite done, quite very, very well and Africa is doing well.</p>
          <p>Will it be big? Now, you've got to look at the demographics, look at the GDP, look at China versus the rest. But will it sustain two or three stores? Yes. Will Rio de Janeiro, will S&#xE3;o Paulo, will these cities? Certainly.</p>
          <p>But if I had to say to you before both demise, Chongqing, you would have said, what? Come on, be honest. Whom of you would have heard of that city before this murder trial? And yet it's a city with 33 million people that's growing at 15.4% per year. They've just built a railway line to Europe. It saves 5.8 days, 0.8, I don't know what they mean by 0.8. But let's say 5.5 days, taking goods from there to Europe by rail. It goes through five or six countries without stopping for duties; both the railway line is there.</p>
          <p>The problem, folks, and I'll leave you with that last thought. That railway line is twice as expensive as anything else and I think you all know why. Because it goes back empty. Empty. It leaves China full and goes back empty, because there's absolutely nothing that Europe can put on that train back to Chongqing.</p>
          <p>Now, this is what President Hollande ought to discuss with Chancellor Merkel. I mean they ought to show visions of the train arriving full and going back empty. Thank you. Luckily we send our stuff by air and we don't have to &#x2013; thanks.</p>
