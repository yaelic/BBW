          <p>All participants please standby, your conference is ready to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Canadian Natural Resources 2012 First Quarter Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Langille, Vice Chairman of Canadian Natural Resources. Please go ahead, Mr. Langille.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending this conference call where we will discuss our first quarter 2012 results and review our planned activities for the balance of 2012 and in some cases beyond that.</p>
          <p>Participating with me today are Steve Laut, our President and Doug Proll, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would refer you to the comments regarding forward-looking information contained in our press release, and also note that all dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars, and production and reserves are both expressed as before royalties, unless otherwise stated. I'll make some initial comments before I turn the call over to Steve and Doug for their in-depth discussion.</p>
          <p>We have come out of a challenging first quarter with even more conviction that our business strategy, plans and principles are right for our industry. Part of our strategy is to maintain an extensive base of assets which can firstly contribute strong current production to generate significant cash flow, secondly, provide excellent economic development opportunities in the near to midterm timeframes, and thirdly, establish significant growth vehicles for production growth in the five-plus year time period. As Steve reviews our projects you will see this base of assets has been set up and is delivering on this strategy.</p>
          <p>Natural gas economics have been under pressure for a number of years as less and less natural gas projects have been able to achieve a recycle ratio of greater than two. Reacting to this, our drilling operations on natural gas projects have been reducing each year for the past six years and this year will be no different. We continue to monitor our producing areas and we'll take any necessary steps, including shutting in production, to ensure we are making positive cash flows from these areas and in very limited situations carrying out activities that will provide adequate returns.</p>
          <p>On the other hand E&amp;P activities on oil prospects continue to be robust. Over 90% of our revenue now comes from sales of oil. We are reaching new levels of production and cash flow achievements. Our light medium oil production in Canada is now averaging over 40,000 barrels per day as new plays and EOR opportunities are pursued.</p>
          <p>In addition, production of NGLs climbed to over 25,000 barrels. Strong drilling results in our primary heavy oil areas has resulted in first quarter production of 120,000 barrels per day. One year ago we were only producing 97,000 barrels. Our international operations continue to contribute free cash flow with C$180 million of free cash flow in excess of the capital requirements of our international operations in the first quarter. And as expected, now that the steaming cycle is ending at Primrose, our thermal in situ property, production is starting to ramp up again and is together targeted to increase daily production to over 100,000 barrels from this quarter's 80,000 barrels.</p>
          <p>Our mining asset incurred some unplanned maintenance time in the first quarter as repairs had to be carried out on the fractionator tower. These repairs were completed in a timely fashion and the production recommenced in mid-March, with April's production reaching almost 112,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Oil pricing continued to be volatile and continues today to be volatile, especially with respect to the discounts being charged on Canadian oil production in the first quarter including synthetic crude oil. The discount climbed dramatically in the first quarter from the last quarter in 2011 as planned and unplanned maintenance issues caused a number of refinery shut-ins during the first quarter and into the early part of the second quarter. As expected, as these refineries are placed back online, the discount is tightening up again. Additional pipeline capacity, some of which is under construction and close to being completed, should also help to alleviate these discounts and the disconnect between Brent pricing and WTI pricing.</p>
          <p>We are in a very strong financial position with our operation providing cash flow to carry out our capital programs, take advantage of any opportunistic acquisitions that may arise, pay dividends, an increase of 17% over last year, and buy back shares as appropriate. Our teams are strong and we are looking forward to carrying out our objectives over the remainder of 2012.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed analysis of our properties. Steve?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter Canadian Natural continued to execute our proven strategy based on effective and efficient operations and authorizing capital allocation to ensure we maximize our return on capital, generate free cash flow, maintain our strong balance sheet through the price cycles, transition our asset base to a more sustainable long-term asset base and provide the ability to increase dividends on a consistent basis.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is one of the few companies in our peer group that has a strong, well balanced and diverse asset base with significant upside in each component of our business. We have on a consistent basis been able to affectively allocate capital and maximize return on capital over the long run and throughout commodity price cycles.</p>
          <p>Today with oil prices and low &#x2013; strong oil prices and low gas prices, Canadian Natural continues to allocate capital disproportionately to oil projects. In 2012, we'll deliver significant production growth. Light oil NGLs in Canada will grow by 16%, primary heavy oil will grow by 19%, and thermal in situ will grow by 8%. Horizon is back on and we expect solid performance for the rest of the year. In addition, we are investing significantly in future production and value growth in a disciplined, cost-effective manner, which also provides us the high level of capital flexibility. Our thermal in situ program will see production increase from 100,000 barrels a day to 480,000 barrels a day of low-cost, high value heavy oil production.</p>
          <p>At Pelican Lake, our leading-edge polymer flood continues to generate significant value for shareholders as we develop the polymer flood across the pool. And at Horizon, our expansion plans to take production from 110,000 barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day and then ultimately 500,000 barrels a day of light sweet, 34-degree API oil are unfolding as expected.</p>
          <p>We also have a vast natural gas assets, which when gas prices strengthen, will provide the opportunity to unlock significant value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to gas and as you know and as John said, outlook for gas pricing has been bearish. We expect gas prices to be low for the next 5 to 10 years. Therefore it's fortunate we are able to leverage our dominant land base and infrastructure to maintain our position as the most effective and efficient producer. Currently we have roughly 16 million cubic a day shut in due to low gas prices. And if gas prices drop below C$2 for a sustained period and we're pretty close to making that call today, we'll shut-in another 22 million cubic feet a day of gas. And if it falls below C$1.75 for a sustained period, another 28 million could be shut in, a reflection of the strength of our gas assets and Canadian Natural's effective and efficient operations.</p>
          <p>The Septimus expansion remains on track. The plant will be expanded from 60 million to 110 million a day with liquids capacity increasing from 5,200 barrels a day to 10,000 barrels a day. Drilling is meeting expectations, and costs are on track. That being said we have deferred seven wells out of the 2012 program.</p>
          <p>Although gas prices are challenging for our gas assets. They make the returns on our thermal heavy oil assets even greater. Canadian Natural has a dominant land position in the high quality fairway for the thermal in situ development. These lands have 78 billion barrels in place, and we expect to recover 8.5 billion barrels from our vast thermal heavy oil assets. Canadian Natural is executing a disciplined, stepwise plan to unlock the huge value of this asset by bringing on 40,000 barrels to 60,000 barrels a day every two to three years and taking production capacity to 480,000 barrels a day at 100% working interest.</p>
          <p>So far in 2012, we're on track to achieve our targeted production growth of 8% at the midpoint of guidance, as additional Primrose development comes on stream, the 2012 Primrose development plan where we're developing five pads at Primrose East that will add 20,000 barrels a day in 2012 and ramp-up to 30,000 barrels a day in 2013. At Primrose South, we're developing three pads, that will add roughly 15,000 barrels a day in 2012, and ramp-up to 20,000 barrels a day in 2013, both at a cost of C$13,000 a flowing barrel.</p>
          <p>Primrose pads are some of the lowest-cost production capacity additions in the industry, as are Canadian Natural's operating costs, which are targeted to come in under C$9 a barrel in 2012, even lower than our benchmark operating cost in 2011, making Canadian Natural's thermal in situ heavy oil production very profitable, if not the most profitable in Canada.</p>
          <p>At Kirby, we remain on track. The Kirby South development is on an overall basis 42% complete and 4% ahead of plan, with construction 32% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and we've committed over C$835 million or 69% of the total budget.</p>
          <p>Overall drilling completions is 47% complete with a rig now on the third pad. Most importantly, we have seen no reservoir surprises and have been able to place the SAGD wells where we want them. Kirby South is targeted to add 40,000 barrels a day of SAGD production with facility room to grow to 45,000 barrels a day, at a cost of C$32,000 per flowing barrel. First steam is scheduled for November 2013.</p>
          <p>The overall Kirby development will see Kirby South capacity increase to 60,000 barrels a day and Kirby North develop to 80,000 barrels a day in two phases, for a total capacity of 140,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>At Kirby North, EDS engineering is 40% complete and on schedule. The regulatory process remains on schedule with the applications submitted in Q4 2011. The main access road, clearing on the main plant site, and stockpiling gravel is complete and we have also ordered some long lead equipment ahead of schedule to lock in lower costs. First steam in for Kirby North is targeted for early 2016.</p>
          <p>At Grouse, the regulatory application for 40,000 barrels a day of capacity has been submitted this quarter, and Grouse DBM engineering is on track to be completed in 2012 and EDS engineering will be kicked off this year as well. Grouse first steam in is targeted for late 2017.</p>
          <p>Turning to primary heavy oil, Canadian Natural has a dominant land and infrastructure position with over 8,000 drilling locations in inventory. As a result, our operations are very effective and efficient, and we are the low-cost producer. With over 120,000 barrels a day of primary heavy oil production, we are the largest primary heavy oil producer in Canada. And as you know, primary heavy oil generates the highest return on capital in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In 2012, heavy oil production will grow by 19% year-over-year with the drilling of 818 wells, up 10 wells and on budget and production is up &#x2013; growth is up from 16% largely on the back of the excellent results we've been having from our new Woodenhouse area, which is about 75 kilometers north of Pelican Lake.</p>
          <p>Results from our Woodenhouse primary slant heavy oil wells are running about 150 barrels a day, which is outstanding for primary slant heavy oil wells and above our expectations. Currently, we're producing about 4,300 barrels a day from this area. We have drilled nine pads of 61 wells, six of the nine pads are now on stream and we expect to bring on another three pads on stream after breakup. We will drill three more pads or 26 wells by year-end and we expect to exit 2012 at 8800 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>We have running room at Woodenhouse to drill another 245 wells over time, significant production growth for this new primary heavy oil area outside of the traditional Northeast primary heavy oil corridor. Woodenhouse is a new area and oil volumes are trucked to Pelican Lake for treating and shipping. Also as with most prolific primarily heavy oil wells, sand production is very high in the initial months. These extra costs plus battery issues at Lindbergh and Beartrap caused us to truck additional volumes to other batteries and allowing some cost inflation drove oil operating costs significantly higher in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Although Q1 op costs are higher, we expect to meet our overall operating cost guidance for the year as Lindbergh and Beartrap battery issues are behind us and we add additional battery facilities at Pelican to handle the Woodenhouse volumes.</p>
          <p>At our world-class Pelican Lake oil pool, Canadian Natural's leading edge polymer flood has been very successful. We believe the Pelican Lake polymer flood will ultimately recover 536 million additional barrels of oil. We've seen solid polymer response in the last quarter of 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012. So we will drill 70 producers and 8 injectors delivering 4% production growth. Battery expansions have accelerated in 2012 to handle the increased production we expect from the portion of the pool converted to polymer flood in the last two years and that begins to ramp up and to handle the unexpected higher production volumes from Woodhouse.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural's light oil and NGL growth in Canada has begun &#x2013; production growth has become significant and we're running about 65,000 barrels a day as we begin to reap the benefits of leveraging technology through water flooding, EOR and horizontal multi-fracs over our large light oil assets in Canada.</p>
          <p>A positive outcome in Q1 has been our ability to drill slightly longer horizontal multi-fracs with more fracs per well than originally planned. This resulted in higher completion cost per well than originally budgeted. However, reserves per well have increased and our F&amp;D costs are lower. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>We'll grow our light oil and NGL production at the target rate of 15% in 2012 ,significant growth. In our next five years we target delivering production growth in the forward 9% range.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international operations, our strategy is to maintain our existing operations and convert our undeveloped resources as slots become available on the platforms, progress the Big E exploration in South Africa, monitor acquisition opportunities, and generate free cash flow. The planning for the abandonment of the merchant platform is also progressing on schedule.</p>
          <p>In offshore Africa, at Espoir we have contracted an alternative rig to complete the infield drilling program scheduled to begin in late 2012. Production increases will begin ramping up in 2013 and increasing to 6,500 BOEs a day at the completion of the drilling program with a total cost of C$143 million, about C$75 million of which will be spent in 2012, for an overall cost of C$24,000 a flowing barrel.</p>
          <p>We have also been awarded a 36% interest in Block 514 in Cote d'Ivoire. We'll acquire 3D seismic and look to drill well in the next three years in what we believe to be a prospective deepwater Cretaceous channel fan play similar to recent discoveries in Ghana and elsewhere in offshore West Africa.</p>
          <p>In Q1 we continued to progress tying up the regulatory requirements before drilling our South Africa exploration well. This series of very large prospects is at the ready to drill stage and has the potential for billion barrel structures, with our best estimate in place of 3 billion barrels. We own this block 100%, which is in deepwater with challenging sea conditions. We will in 2012 begin the processes of selecting a partner to drill the first exploration well in South Africa, likely in 2013 at the earliest.</p>
          <p>Turning to Horizon, where we continue to focus on operation discipline, utilizing conservative start up practices and a philosophy of safe, steady reliable operations, the addition of the third OPP plant has made a made a significant difference since the startup in March. With only two OPPs in Q4 of 2011, our availability was 81% which is a big improvement over 2010 availability of 71%.</p>
          <p>However, with the addition of a third OPP, we've achieved 98% availability in April, a significant improvement. As a result our reliance on intermediate tankage has been reduced and we can more effectively utilize these tanks to achieve overall high reliability and steady state operations in the upgrader, which results in less maintenance and equipment failures. Our April production came in at 111,500 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Turning to Horizon expansion, our plan is to expand from 110,000 barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day and then ultimately 500,000 barrels a day of light sweet 34 API crude with no declines for 40 years. As you know, we've broken the expansion into five parts with 46 different pieces to ensure cost control and capital flexibility.</p>
          <p>At this point our strategy is working well and we're on track with capital costs running slightly under our cost estimates. We expect this strategy of breaking into smaller pieces, stopping and redefining scope and rebidding if necessary will continue to pay dividends going forward, even as market conditions potentially heat up. We've also been able to achieve significant lump sum EPC contracts that will provide a higher degree of cost certainty going forward. As you heard me discuss at the last conference call, the expansion to 250,000 barrels a day will add significant value for shareholders, not only in the increased production, but will result in significant reduction in operating costs and increased plant reliability, a key and often overlooked component of expansion economics.</p>
          <p>Let me take a minute to reiterate these important points. Expansion will have a significant impact on operating cost as with the exception of mining costs and natural gas cost, our operating costs are largely fixed with the biggest component being labor, Q1 showed you that. Mining costs were roughly C$8.50 a barrel at the current time, and with the expansion, we could see small efficiency gains. Natural gas costs are roughly C$2.50 a barrel assuming a C$3.50 gas price.</p>
          <p>Therefore, expansion economics look very favorable as operating costs for the entire production steam are reduced significantly. And in a C$5 gas world, we expect operating costs to be in the C$22 to C$28 a barrel range. This reduction in operating costs plus increased reliability, which not only provides more stable revenue, but in itself reduces operating costs on a per unit basis, make a significant contribution to the return on capital for Horizon expansions.</p>
          <p>Canadian Naturals in great shape with significant production growth and value to unlock our oil &#x2013; unlock our oil assets. Now recently there have been market anomalies that have caused some concerns, particularly the logistical constraints at Cushing have caused the WTI to Brent differential to blow out.</p>
          <p>We believe that this is an anomaly and will be short-lived as the Seaway reversal kicks in this month followed by the expansion in Q1 2013 relieving the bottlenecks at Cushing. Ultimately with the Keystone Cushing market link coming in Q2 2013, we believe the WTI Brent differential will collapse back to essentially the approximate toll rate between Cushing and the Gulf Coast. Good news for all North American oil producers.</p>
          <p>On the heavy side, the blow out of heavy oil differentials in the first quarter is almost entirely due to planned and unplanned outages of heavy oil refinery capacity, as John mentioned. As this capacity comes back online, we have seen a dramatic narrowing of heavy oil differentials. May's spot differentials are C$20,000 a barrel or 19% of WTI below our long-term estimate of 22% to 24% and current June indications are in the 14% range.</p>
          <p>Now, there is some concern that additional Canadian heavy oil volumes slated to come on stream by year end we will see a widening differential at that time. We believe this is unlikely as an additional 300,000 barrels a day of heavy oil conversion capacity is also slated to come on stream.</p>
          <p>In summary, capital expenditure for 2012 will be C$7.35 billion, which includes C$100 million allocated for property acquisitions and another C$150 million of our free cash flow recently allocated to long-term oil projects for the second half of 2012, which does not add any material volumes for our 2012 guidance, however, it will push us up slightly within that guidance range.</p>
          <p>We're increasing the oil development capital to capture additional value adding opportunities not contemplated in the original budget. These projects make good sense and are an excellent use of our free cash flow. In more detail, this includes the following items: Longer horizontal light oil wells with more fracs; additional op cost reduction projects converting our primary heavy oil wells from propane to natural gas; adding water disposal wells, and importantly sand handling facilities; drilling 10 additional wells in Q4 at Pelican; additional battery facilities at Pelican to handle increased polymer and Woodenhouse volumes; Kirby South facilities are running ahead of schedule, good news, so costs were accelerated; Kirby North we accelerated ordering of long leads to lock in lower costs; and at Primrose we've added more pad facilities in Q4; and we've acquired additional exploration block in Cote d'Ivoire.</p>
          <p>In addition to all this we've seen some cost inflation in our very active primary heavy oil areas in the order about 5%. Canadian Natural targets cash flow of between C$7.2 billion to C$8 billion at the strip, driving a free cash-flow between C$100 million and C$900 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>As I just mentioned, we're putting some of that free cash-flow to excellent use in our long-term value adding projects. Our production growth is very solid at 10% Q4 over Q4 2012 to 2011, very impressive when you consider this growth is organic and 54% of our capital program does not deliver production in 2012. Considering the volatility in the global economy today it is also important that we have a significant flexibility to reduce our capital program by up to C$3 billion or 40% if a significant event were to occur, ensuring we preserve a strong balance sheet which in 2012 becomes stronger, with debt reduction of over C$300 million and debt to book shrinking to 24.5% at the midpoint of guidance.</p>
          <p>Canadian Natural is in a very strong position. With our effective capital allocation strategy, our balanced assets which contain significant upside, we are delivering strong oil weighted production growth, investing significantly in future production growth, yet retaining capital flexibility paying down debt and generating free cash flow.</p>
          <p>In closing, it's clear that Canadian Natural is in great shape, our management, business philosophies and practices work, we have a strong, well balanced and diverse asset base with vast opportunities. Our strategy is balanced, effective and proven and we have control over capital allocation and are nimble enough to capture opportunities. Our strong assets combined with our great teams of people and our culture, which is focused on execution excellence, effective operations and cost control will allow Canadian Natural to build an even stronger, more sustainable asset base which will drive an even more significant free cash flow in the future.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it over to Doug to discuss our prudent financial management.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Steve and good morning.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations amounted to C$1.28 billion or C$1.16 per share and adjusted net earnings amounted to C$300 million or C$0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our financial results for the first quarter of 2012 were impacted by the production disruption discussed by Steve at Horizon as well as lower net back realizations for our Western Canadian select crude oil and our natural gas sales. The reduced cash flow from Horizon operations also resulted in a temporary increase in our effective income tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter to 35% as the result of the proportionate share of income allocated to higher tax jurisdictions outside Alberta, in, particularly, the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>We believe that with Horizon operating as planned, with improved reliability, our annualized effective income tax rate will return to our expected range of 26% to 30%. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong. We exited the quarter with C$8.2 billion of long term debt, below the C$8.6 billion at the end of 2011. Our debt to book capitalization at the end of the quarter is 26% and debt to EBITDA is 1 times, our liquids resources also remain strong. At March 31 our undrawn bank lines amounted to over C$4 billion.</p>
          <p>Our commodity hedging program has been further enhanced and now includes 150,000 barrels per day of Brent collars with a floor of US $80 for the remainder of 2012 and then reducing for the first half of 2013 to 50,000 barrels per day. In addition, we have $80 puts for 100,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our Q1 results reinforce our commitment to a strong balance sheet, adequate liquid resources and a flexible capital structure to weather uncertain commodity prices and unpredictable events, whether they be short term event driven or long term cyclical changes in our business environment.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I'll return you to John for some closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just my question is around -- Steve, you talked about the organic growth, which is quite impressive. Now based on all of this is heavy oil, so the question really is around at what price &#x2013; and my understanding is the underlying reason, one of the underlying reasons for the growth is obviously higher oil prices. So at what crude oil price would you start to take a second look at your heavy oil portfolio, if you could talk about WTI prices and also what discounts or heavy oil differentials would be bothersome to that growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George. And I would say you are right, the majority of our growth is heavy oil, but there is significant light oil growth in the synthetic from Horizon and obviously our light oil growth in Canada is growing at 15% from about 65,000 barrels a day. So, we do have light oil growth, so a good balance there. But lot of this is coming from heavy oil from a thermal projects and from primary heavy oil and at Pelican.</p>
          <p>So, each one of those things would probably have a different cut-off point. I would say if we start with thermal heavy oil, depending what your gas price is, if you had gas prices in that $5 range, and obviously we're a lot lower than that today, gas prices in the $5 range, you would probably look at about a $55 to $65 range to cut off. Our primary heavy oil would probably be maybe even lower than that, in the $50 range, and then Pelican Lake I would say be close to same as primary, in that $50 range. Now obviously with lower gas prices our thermal heavy oil would have a lower cut point.</p>
          <p>Now differentials obviously play a big part of it, so we're assuming you have in those prices or in that normal range of 22% to 24% of WTI. And that's what we think long-term where we will end up and we can tell, obviously our primary heavy oil wells are very effective. Woodenhouse for example -- those wells are paying out in less than six months. So, I hope that gives you color, George.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks a lot. That's helpful. I guess just one quick follow-up, and we've seen the gyrations in differentials and you talked about your expectations for them, the differentials, the tightening here. As you look into the future, would you look at any downstream opportunities, just to be able to capture some of that, some of those gyrations generate outsized profits on the downstream side. Would that be something you'd consider at all?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have looked at it in the past and we did consider it and I guess I'll point out that we are progressing the engineering at Redwater, our partnership with North West, the upgrader there going to be built in Edmonton. That's 50,000 barrels a day and the engineering is progressing on track and we expect to sanction that project this year, so we're working on that part of it.</p>
          <p>We've been unable to do as many other producers have been doing as trading reserves for downstream assets and mainly because our view is we can build upgrading and refinery assets, but we can't build reserves in the ground, so for us it's been tough to make that deal work. But obviously we're open to it, but I think our path right now is through the Redwater upgrader and getting increased access to heavy oil refinery markets.</p>
          <p>To that end, we do believe Keystone will be approved or won't be approved until after the election, obviously, and when that happens plus all the other pipeline activity you see, we should be able to access significant heavy oil markets in the Gulf Coast.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Steve, just a couple of questions and one is just on the Canadian oil liquids OpEx. How much of the delta do you think was related to one-time items and how much of a reversal would you expect as we get into the second and third quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question just more strategic. You acquired about $1 billion of nat gas properties last year. Is this the kind of market where you're going to continue to consolidate, just given pricing and so on? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; let's talk about the gas price first and I'll get back to the operating costs, so I don't forget the gas. Hard time keeping focused on gas. We think there are opportunities also for gas price but right now we are not seeing a lot of it and obviously it has to fit with us and it has to make sense, and so we haven't really done too much yet, but we obviously monitor the market and we evaluate everything that's in our core area.</p>
          <p>As towards operating costs, almost the largest part of that is one-time events. Obviously, the Beartrap and Lindberg batteries caused us to truck volumes all over the place. We had additional sand that we had to truck. Now, we have sand handling facilities coming on stream, we have additional sand disposal wells, and both Lindbergh and Beartrap are back on stream at full capacity after the upsets. So, most of that is going to go away and that's why we believe we're going to be right within the guidance that we set out the start of the year and that's C$11 to C$13 a barrel versus the C$15.40 we had here in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; great. And then the last thing that threw us a little bit was just that &#x2013; it was like a C$94 million charge -- I hate modeling questions -- but it was like a C$94 million charge I think on FX and so forth, could you speak to that as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, basically, what we have is we have outstanding foreign exchange positions related to our currency management in our business, and those positions settle monthly. So positions -- the ones that you saw in the first quarter, the $84 million were the losses. We would expect some reversal of those in the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question. Two questions, I have here, the first one is kind of on Horizon, the other is just jumping back production expenses. So for Horizon, it was stated that capital costs are running slightly under your cost estimates. I'm just wondering if you could give any clarification on what those cost estimates are looking at right now for phase 2 A and B? And the production expense question relates to natural gas, kind of related to the oil question. Can you kind of give some extra insight into what part of that 15% higher cost relative to Q1 2011 are kind of one-time events or are we going to be looking at higher costs going forward for natural gas? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks for bringing up that operating cost on gas, because I missed that. Obviously our natural gas price costs are higher in first quarter and that is due entirely to some acquisitions that we had close in the fourth quarter and it takes us some time to get those things assimilated into our system and see those costs drop. So, again that's on the process and we made good progress in the first quarter. And we haven't changed our guidance for operating costs on gas for the year because we believe and we're all well on track to getting those cost back in line, so we will be within guidance on gas, so that's a one-time event on natural gas.</p>
          <p>Horizon Capital, we are running slightly under, and I would say it's maybe about 5% under and some parts are 10% but overall maybe 5%, and we will see how that continues. Obviously we have some concerns that the market will heat up and we will not be able to continue to get those discounts going forward, but we are going to do our best.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Quick question just with regards to the Woodenhouse asset. Just wondering if you could mention what zone that is. Curious if it's a Wabiskaw play, something you see that's a regional and kind of looking beyond this year, like how much running room do you see in that play?</p>
          <p>Second related question would be on the royalties there, just given the location. Is this something where you're also getting oil sands equivalent royalty or would it look more like a typical heavy oil royalty for conventional oil in Alberta? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, Chris. Woodenhouse is in the Wabiskaw zone, as you have mentioned. It is primary heavy oil. We see quite a bit of running room and like I said, we have 245 wells to drill, it does get the 1% royalty, so oil sands royalty to a payout. We believe on Woodenhouse alone the overall pool is probably about 282 million barrels in place. However, I would say the sweet spot is probably about 163 million barrels in place. And recoveries look to be about 15% but with the performance we are getting, that might creep up over time, but it is too early to say if we see that kind of increase in recoveries.</p>
