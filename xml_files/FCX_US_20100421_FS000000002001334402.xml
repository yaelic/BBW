          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Our results released early this morning and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. We also have several slides to supplement our comments, those are also available on our webcast link at fcx.com. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today's comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call, include forward-looking statements. I want to refer you on to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>On the call today are Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; I've got a number of our senior operating team here today including Red Conger, Dave Thornton and Mark Johnson.</p>
          <p>I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who'll be going through our presentation materials. We'll then open up the call for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Today, FCX reported first quarter 2010 net income applicable to common stock of 897 million, $2 per share, as compared with net income of 43 million or $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Our 2010 first quarter results include losses on the early extinguishment of debt totaling 23 million to net income or $0.05 per share.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter consolidated copper sales of 960 million pounds were higher than the January 2010 estimate of 890 million pounds, but below first quarter 2009 copper sales of 1 billion pounds.</p>
          <p>The favorable variance to the January 2010 estimate primarily reflects the timing of sales for our North American copper mines and the variance to the 2009 period reflects the anticipated lower copper ore grades at Grasberg resulting from planned mine sequencing; and lower sales from our South American mines in the first quarter as anticipated. These lower sales were partly offset by sales from the Tenke Fungurume mine in Africa, where we sold over 60 million pounds copper in the first quarter. Our consolidated gold sales for the first-quarter of 2010 totaled 478,000, that was slightly less than our previous estimate of 490,000 ounces and lower than the first-quarter 2009 sales of 545,000 ounces. That reflects the lower ore grades at Grasberg resulting from the lower grade material that we're currently mining.</p>
          <p>Our molybdenum sales of 17 million pounds in the first quarter of 2010 were significantly higher than last year's first quarter of 10 million pounds and higher than our estimate of 15 million pounds because of the improved demand in the metallurgical and chemical sectors of molybdenum markets.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter results reflect improved pricing for all of our products; copper, gold and molybdenum. Our realized price for copper was $3.42 per pound in the first quarter. That was almost double the price in the year-ago quarter. Our gold realization was $1,110 per ounce in the first-quarter 2010, that compared with $904 per ounce in the first quarter of 2009; and our realized molybdenum price of $15.09 per pound in the first quarter of 2010 was over 30% higher than last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated unit net cash cost averaged $0.81 per pound in the first quarter 2010. As anticipated, it was higher than the $0.66 per pound reported in the first quarter of 2009. As previously discussed, our higher unit costs in 2010 primarily reflect the anticipated lower copper volumes at Grasberg.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flows in the quarter are very strong at 1.8 billion. Those were significantly above our capital expenditures of 231 million. We took additional steps during the quarter to reduce debt. We paid &#x2013; reduced our debt by 281 million in the first quarter and then on April 1st, we redeemed another $1 billion in senior floating rate notes, due 2015. Going back to the first quarter of 2009's &#x2013; the last 15 months, we've repaid approximately 2.3 billion in debt and that results in interest savings of about 155 million per annum. After taking into account the April 1st payment, our total debt approximated 5.1 billion and our consolidated cash position, approximately 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We separately announced today, a separately press release that our Board has authorized, an increase in our common stock dividend from an annual rate of $0.60 per share to $1.20 per share, that's $0.30 per quarter, to be paid with the next dividend scheduled in August of 2010.</p>
          <p>At the end of March, we had 431 million common shares outstanding. On May 1, our 6.75 mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock. Assuming the minimum conversion rate, FCX would have approximately 470 million common shares outstanding after conversion. This will reduce our preferred dividend by about $194 million for the year or just under $15 million a quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to the slide materials on our website.</p>

          <p>Good morning everyone. On our first slide, on slide 3, has a picture of our annual report. We'll have the wide mailing of this annual report, will go out later this week. And in it, we talk about the success we had in executing our operating plans in 2009, focus on our long-life assets, our significant reserves in mineral resources and our prospects for growing our business over time, the fact that our assets are geographically diverse. We have a strong financial position, as Kathleen just outlined, and we have a great management team that perform &#x2013; performed very, very well during 2009.</p>
          <p>The first quarter 2010 highlights, which Kathleen just reviewed was on page 4 &#x2013; when I look at these numbers, a couple of things really jump out at me. First, we had a quarter of where we had more than 5% fewer volumes &#x2013; lower volumes in copper production, 10% lower production of gold, and that was driven by our mine plants, our sequencing at Grasberg, it's &#x2013; our operations performed very strongly in the first quarter of '010 as they did the first quarter of '09, but we had &#x2013; we did have a lower volumes.</p>
          <p>We had copper prices that were twice on average the realizations that we had a year ago, gold realizations were up 20%, and it shows how leveraged our business is, to these commodity prices. Our revenues were up by two-thirds and our earnings were up 20 times over the quarter a year ago. But focus on the cost. As copper prices have doubled, certain of our costs do go up. As you know, energy costs for example, are higher. But our cost structure is very similar to what we had a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our net unit costs reflecting the benefits of the higher molybdenum prices and the higher gold prices, even though we had lower gold volumes, is in the same neighborhood as our costs were a year ago, and the lower volumes did effect our unit costs in terms of the cost before by-product credits. But, our commodity price realizations are so much stronger than the impact of the elements of our costs that are rising, and our focus on efficiency of operations is yielding ongoing benefits, that when you put the pictures together of the realization from prices with the cost structure inherent in our business, you end up seeing &#x2013; while we have a business that's able to generate operating cash flows like we did in the first quarter of $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The cost structure is given in more detail on page 5. As we look at what happened in the first quarter, our unit cost was $0.81 net of by-product credits, where it was $0.66 a year ago. And if we look at it by regions, particularly focusing on our operation in the Americas where we operate mines that are great mines but have lower grades than we do in Indonesia &#x2013; to have North America's unit cost be at $1.13 this quarter, where they were $1.22 a year ago when we were in the depths of the downturn, and to see the attractive cost structures we have in South America and even in Indonesia where we had lower volumes because of our mine sequencing, we still end up with $0.10 a pound. It's a very &#x2013; again, emphasizing the point of the relationship between our cost and leveraged commodity prices.</p>
          <p>The markets continue to be good. Copper market is strongly supported by China with the strength of its fundamental economy continuing to be exhibited. Copper imports continue to be strong. The speculation is that some of those imports are going into warehouses and that might affect imports later in the year. But when you get through all of it, the fact that the internal Chinese economy is so strong, the continuing growth in the standard of living is evidenced by consumer spending; automobiles, air conditioners and the like. The continued building of housing for people and infrastructure indicates how strong this is.</p>
          <p>Now, we do have a market that's been characterized by strength in China and weakness in the developed world and the U.S. and Japan and Europe, and elements in those economies continue to be weak, particularly in the construction side of the business. But, but, we are seeing the beginning of signs of improved demand for our products in the developed world. As we review what our customers are telling us about our business, important parts of that business continue to be weak, but there are pockets where we are seeing improved demand for our products, and as you will see, that's leading us to begin to change our strategy of where we have had curtailment of our high-cost production and now we are taking steps to restore some of that production and invest more aggressively in growth for the future.</p>
          <p>We'll start with Morenci, the flagship mine in North America, our traditional mine in the southwest copper district. We had been very aggressive in adjusting Morenci's operations in 2008 and 2009. Third quarter 2008, many of you will remember, our unit cost at Morenci was approaching $2 a pound. This is a mine where we don't have the benefit of by-product credits. So, we cut our mine rate in half. We shut our mill down. We reduced our employment and our equipment fleet and we pushed our cost down so that Morenci's unit cost were at a level that would've allowed it to remain cash-flow positive at very low copper prices.</p>
          <p>Now that we're seeing more positive marketplaces, we have begun to take steps to ramp up some of the curtailed production that we had. We've restarted our mill. We were already mining sulfide ore. This will allow us to process that ore, recover the copper from it, and we will be increasing the mill rate to come to a rate of 50,000 tons-per-day by 2011.</p>
          <p>We've cut our mine rate in half at Morenci from over a million short-term &#x2013; short tons to 500,000 short-term. So, now we've taken &#x2013; we are taking steps to ramp up the mining rate to get that rate back up to 700,000 short tons a day and we're studying going-forward.</p>
          <p>We're looking at increasing our employment at Morenci which had been cut significantly, by about 20%, and we are very encouraged that we're being able to find good workers to come back into the workforce. We're mining to do additional stripping to expose the ore that we then can put on our leach stacks and process through our mill, and this will have a cost associated with that. And because of the nature of SX/EW operations, some of the benefits of that increased mining rate won't be realized immediately, but over time, as we recover the copper from the leach stacks. So, you will see additional cost coming into Morenci, but when we look at the rate of return that we will have from investing in that cost with this kind of copper market, it is very positive. And so, we are looking at adding to the copper production from Morenci.</p>
          <p>We had a project that we were beginning to invest in, in Arizona at the historical Miami mining district. We had deferred that project and now we're investing in some new equipment, using some of our existing equipment, and that will allow us to recover some copper as we continue to deal with the reclamation activities in that area.</p>
          <p>At Safford, the relatively new mine that's very near Morenci, we had a project that we were pursuing to build a sulfur burner. We now &#x2013; moving forward with that project, we had already spent some money on it. This will significantly reduce our need to buy sulfuric acid in the marketplace and give us a lot more flexibility as we go forward. And Safford is a mine like many of our other mines, that has very positive potential for further development with the sulfide ore body associated with the existing oxide operations and a major new ore body potential at Lone Star. So over time, as we will at our other North American mines, we'll be looking to invest and increase production significantly at Safford and the sulfur burner will give us a lot of flexibility in doing that.</p>
          <p>In South America, at our large mine in Peru, Cerro Verde, we are proceeding with a project to increase the mill rate there from 108,000 tons-per-day to 120,000 tons-per-day, not a lot of capital but it'll allow us to achieve in the relatively near-term, incremental copper &#x2013; at a very low cash cost. But this was a mine that has the resources, has the footprint, the resources available to provide for a major expansion. And we are now engaged in a feasibility study to look at an expansion that would involve a major investment in new milling facilities, with the potential to more than double its output. We will be completing that feasibility study by the end of this year and by early next year we would fully expect to go forward with the decision to do a major expansion project at Cerro Verde.</p>
          <p>And Chile, at our El Abra mine, we are completing the mining and processing of an oxide ore resource that's been the basis for this operation for the past 15 years or so. There is a significant sulfide resource and we had begun work, before the downturn, on a project to develop that sulfide resource through a leaching process called Sulfolix. We deferred that a year now. We're investing and going-forward with that project, it &#x2013; in of itself, would allow extension of the mine life by more than 10 years with significant production, and it requires some capital; 535 million for the initial phase to be completed in 2010. But, as we have been conducing core drilling in that area, we've expanded the resource available &#x2013; the sulfide resource, and we see the potential for a major mill investment in &#x2013; at El Abra, and we are working cooperatively with our minority shareholder, Codelco, which has other mining operations in the area. We've begun a pre-feasibility study jointly with Codelco to look at how we got &#x2013; might most efficiently consider this milling opportunity. Again, it's a major opportunity for a mine three years ago that we were &#x2013; we didn't &#x2013; we weren't aware that we would have this kind of opportunity. It's really exciting for us.</p>
          <p>Yet in Indonesia, when we curtail capital, we didn't curtail capital for our ongoing investment in developing the underground resources in Indonesia because it's so critical to our future operations and strategy. This is one of the most significant undeveloped resources anywhere in this industry, anywhere in the world, with aggregate reserves of over 40 billion pounds of copper and 35 million ounces of gold.</p>
          <p>You've watched us expand the DOZ mine, which was initially targeted to be a 20, 25,000-ton-per-day mine and now it's operating at over 80,000 tons-per-day and it's going-forward. We're developing the higher-grade Big Gossan mine. The Grasberg block cave, which is the key to our future after the depletion of the Grasberg pit, which is currently scheduled for 2015, we're studying the possibility of extending that for some short period of time. But the Grasberg resources will be there that will allow us to continue in a way that we didn't &#x2013; we weren't planning for. So, in the relatively recent past, to continue to operate Grasberg as a high-volume, low-cost mine, we're seeing the production from underground resources, hopefully reaching 240 tons-per-day for our operations there, to give you just how significant that would be. That'll include initially the development of the Grasberg block cave, the continuation of the DOZ mine, which has a significant life in the ultimate development of the deeper resources below the DOZ and adjacent to it, the Deep MLZ mine. All of that is really progressing well and on schedule.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we have the exciting potential of dealing with the resources at this very large concession &#x2013; of more than 600 square mile concession at Tenke Fungurume in the Katanga province of the DRC. Our initial project, which was being completed around this time last year for the copper circuit, is operating and we achieved the design copper production rates during the fourth quarter of 2009 and our copper circuit is operating &#x2013; is operating very well.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we produced about 5 million pounds of cobalt, sold 3 million pounds. We're still working to get the cobalt circuit and the related SO2 plant operating in an efficient fashion and dealing with startup issues. At full rates for this initial stage of the project, we would have annual production of about 250 million pounds of copper and over 18 million pounds of cobalt, with more than that in the early years. We continue to do exploration drilling and exploration and development analysis for the resources to allow expansion beyond this initial project. We have a feasibility study that we're currently working on for the next phase of development there, and put this in the context, we currently see the resources that are there available to us to reach a doubling of the current production outlook from the oxide resources, using an expansion of the basic system that we have now. We would be approaching that in two steps and this feasibility study is looking at the first step of that development to optimize the current system and looking at various expansion opportunities to expand production up to a half of where we are right now, and then there would be a subsequent oxide development.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, we are seeing a sulfide resource and mixed ore resource that would allow significant further development that we would like to pursue aggressively, that would allow this to become a world-class mine and we will be working diligently on our exploration and development analysis to see where we go. We continue to have discussions with the government on the contract revisitation process and we are &#x2013; those discussions which have been going on now for a number of months, continue to be positive and we continue to have a strong belief that we will able to reach a agreement that's a mutual agreement for both sides of this. This project is so important to the country and we're committed to working with the country in a positive way and doing things in the right way.</p>
          <p>You saw in the earlier financial information, that price of molybdenum has also increased. It reflects an improved marketplace, Chinese imports, and a good outlook the same way we have for copper. We had adjusted our primary molybdenum production at Henderson aggressively in response to market conditions a year ago. That mine operated at roughly 60% of its capacity during most of 2009. We're now up to roughly 90% of the capacity at Henderson and we are studying the restart of the really attractive project for reopening the Climax mine in Leadville, Colorado. This is a project that's going to get done, it's just a question of when we pull the trigger to do it. It is probably the most attractive molybdenum project in the world. Initial phase for that project would result in large scale production, 30 million pounds a year, attractive costs, $3 a pound or so, and have future growth opportunities that would allow us to consider over time expanding it maybe by as much as double the 30 million pounds. It's a project of where we spent some capital. We deferred it. It would take two summer construction periods to complete it, and we are evaluating, when do we start with that construction.</p>
          <p>Page 13 talks about our current projects under evaluation. Now, all of you have been reading about the supply issues affecting the copper business, and they're significant. Faced with the growing demand for copper in China, the signs of recovery and an ultimate recovery in the developed world, the world is going to need copper. And during this period of time when we've had to deal with the economic turmoil, projects have been deferred, the existing mines continue to age and deplete, rates fall, operating systems are ageing. The industry is faced with significant capital just to extend and maintain mine lives at some of the big mines around the world, some of them like we're facing at Grasberg, are looking at going underground. People are investing in challenging projects these days to find &#x2013; to find a ore that can be developed and those are &#x2013; many of those projects have technological issues and community acceptance, and most government issues.</p>
          <p>What's so positive about our company is that we operate in most of the major mining districts around the world. We have existing operations that have very substantial amounts of resources associated with current production. Based on our core drilling to-date, we identified mineral resources that have contained copper of over 100 billion pounds, which is more than actually than our existing reserves. And so, we are &#x2013; we are focused on planning on expanding these operations over time as the market needs them.</p>
          <p>In North America, we're looking at a shorter-term basis at starting mining at our Chino mine in New Mexico where we had suspended operations. We talked about further increases in Morenci's mine rates. We acquired some additional land adjacent to our Sierrita mine in Arizona, the Twin Buttes property, and that gives us some development opportunities there for that resource, perhaps jointly with Sierrita, the Climax restart. And then in North America, our major mines have significant sulfide resources that we are looking at milling options to develop over time.</p>
          <p>We talked about South America, the expansions of Cerro Verde and El Abra. We continue to explore in Chile and have contacts with industry participants about joint participations there. We talked about Tenke, which has exciting growth opportunities; and Grasberg, we continue to find resources associated with the Grasberg district and new exploration outside Grasberg.</p>
          <p>We are significantly stepping up our exploration budget this year. We've curtailed it somewhat. Really didn't slow down our exploration effort, but we had a lot of data that we'd accumulated in 2007, 2008, which we continue to evaluate it. We added reserves last year. We expect to continue to add reserves as we look to go forward, but we are increasing exploration budget to &#x2013; in the range of $100 million or more and we'll spend a million on exploration whenever it makes sense.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2010, we had a good first quarter. We are continuing to have a sales outlook of 3.8 billion pounds of copper, 1.8 million ounces of gold, 62 million pounds of molybdenum. We'll work for opportunities to beat those numbers to move volumes forward. We've had success with that in the past. But for purposes of our guidance, we're continuing with that.</p>
          <p>Even with a doubling of the price of copper, hard gold prices, hard molybdenum prices and some higher input costs, with some lower volumes this year because of sequencing at Grasberg, we're forecasting a very attractive unit cost rate of $0.88 a pound; really, really positive thing for our company.</p>
          <p>At current outlooks for prices and cost, we would generate $6 billion of operating cash flows with $1.7 billion of capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Our sales profile going out through 2012 is presented on page 16. You can see a growth of about 100 million pounds a year from the projects that we're announcing today, that go from those three periods. We're going to be focused on these growth opportunities and we'll be updating our analysis for that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Our gold sales at Grasberg are strictly driven by the sequencing situation, the resources. The same &#x2013; it's just a question of where we are in our mine sequencing. On our website with this, addendums to these slides, you've got some information on that so you can visually see how this work. We also have a five-year outlook for prices beyond 2012. We return to higher levels of gold sales at Grasberg.</p>
          <p>For the year, those of you familiar with Freeport know that quarter-to-quarter results vary depending on this sequencing issue. And it's not a negative. It's just the way our business operates. And when we mine at the higher reaches of the Grasberg pit, which is now about a kilometer deep, we have lower grades than when we're at the core, as we were during 2009. Those units on a &#x2013; anytime we draw a circle around and calculate a unit cost, are going to be affected by those volumes. So, you can see that as we sequenced out of the high-grade section during the first quarter, we'll be at a lower-grade section of Grasberg. You can really see that on the gold slide. It's charted at the upper right.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, when we report second quarter results, we're going to have lower volumes, higher unit costs for that quarter. The key to it is to look at this situation over time and see just what an attractive story we have in terms of the volumes and costs in relation to the commodities that we are exposed to.</p>
          <p>Our unit costs for the year are presented on page 18, and if you go back and look at where we were going into the year, you can see that even though we have these high commodity prices, our cost structure is being maintained. Our cost of $0.88 outlook now compares with $0.86 we had at the end of the first quarter; North America at 1.24, is the same as where we were at the end of the first quarter, as is South America and Indonesia. All are very consistent and it's an interesting comparison actually to go back and look at where we were last year and think about, again, a year where we have so much higher copper prices that our cost structure is being maintained at such an attractive level.</p>
          <p>Page 19 shows EBTIDA variations and operating cash flow variations over copper pricing ranging from 2.50 to 3.50. This is based on $1,000 gold and $10 molybdenum average volumes for 2010, 2011, and over that range our EBITDA ranges from approaching $6 billion to over $8.5 billion; and our operating cash flow ranges from 3.7 billion to 6.5 billion. That's $10 billion, 9.7, I can't read my own writing here. 9.7 for EBITDA at 350. So, at 3.50 you're looking at almost $10 billion of the EBITDA and $6.5 billion of operating cash flows.</p>
          <p>Sensitivities are shown on page 29, so you can adjust based on your own view of those factors. Capital expenditures for 2010, 2011 in aggregate are up about $300 billion, we'll continue to review those $300 million. The 2010 is actually the same as our original estimate. Some has been reallocated from a timing perspective. But, we're going to looking to spend more capital as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We have, over the past three years, really significantly improved our balance sheet. It was three years ago that we completed the Phelps Dodge transaction, had over $17.5 billion of debt. Today, we have pro forma for activities we &#x2013; debt reductions we took after the end of the quarter, of about $5 billion of debt and $2.7 billion of cash. So, our balance sheet is extraordinarily strong. You can see that on page 23. When you look at our debt maturities, we really have minimal debt maturities going out through 2014 and we' d been able to achieve what we wanted to from a debt standpoint.</p>
          <p>So, where does that leave us? We've got a strong balance sheet, very strong liquidity position. Our cost of management has been effective and we're committed to maintaining that effectiveness. We are focused on investing in growth with our existing sets of assets and being alert to other opportunities that are out there in the industry. We've taken opportunities to reduce debt, this has now allowed our Board with being announced today to double our dividend on our common shares; and with the amount of cash that we are generating, that's going to give us very positive opportunities to invest in this business, very positive opportunities to enhance shareholder returns through common stock dividends and give us the opportunity consider executing on our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>That's the summary. So, we are very pleased now to turn the call over for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Richard and congratulations to you and Jim Bob and the entire team for another great quarter. And also thanks very much for the action on the dividend. I think that's a great signal to the marketplace. My question is really around the Tenke project and how far can you push production without a rail connection to the port?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; we can double production using our existing transportation system, that's producing copper cathode and actually the truck system has worked reasonably well, much better than, quite frankly, expectations were. There are times we have delays at the borders. But the system has worked reasonably well and we think &#x2013; we see it working for a doubling of where we are now.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, we use contractors and there's some Congo lease contractors and also some South African contractors, but the equipment availability is there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when will you know or do you know right now, what the size of production could be if you had a rail connection?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, over time, people have talked in the range of 400,000 tons, 500,000 tons, but it's really dependent on what we see with our continuation of our drilling as we analyze development options. But, clearly something that could get up to world-class mine levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that require you or in most cases result in giving up some portion of the equity stake in the mine for that rail connection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, I mean we're &#x2013; it wouldn't require it. I mean, we will always look for what's the best structure and so forth of what we might do. But nothing's required. I mean it's &#x2013; the rail connection really &#x2013; the optimal solution would be connecting with this railroad that's being built through Angola by the Government of Angola, supported by Chinese. There's a much &#x2013; the connection within the county is really an old rail line that once was there and it would be restoring and it's not the kind of &#x2013; it's not a significant project that you have in Angola. So, it would &#x2013; it's something that we're talking with the government about, it's somewhere down the road, it's not a near-term deal. But we are confident that could be &#x2013; that could be built.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got &#x2013; I've got a couple questions. One is in regards to El Abra and the other one is more strategic in nature. But the first one with El Abra, I noticed that Diego Hernandez has joined up with Codelco. And I'm wondering with Mr. Hernandez now as CEO, do you see Codelco perhaps being a little bit more aggressive in how they approach projects and maybe a little bit more willing to work with you, as you indicated that you're looking at this more significant expansion? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Tony, let me just answer that. I mean, Diego is a &#x2013; Diego is a guy we know very well. I've gotten to be friends with him down in Chile and I'm pleased for him, he'll do great job for Codelco. But we had worked, we had developed a relationship with Codelco under the existing management that was extraordinarily positive.</p>
          <p>There had been some history at El Abra, but I was just down at CESCO, I met with Jose Pablo and his team and they were very positive about our work at El Abra where they have a 49% interest. They are enthusiastic about this joint project we're undertaking. And so, we couldn't have been more pleased with our relationship with Codelco as it stands now, and I'm sure it'll be great under the new management team. The Minister of Mines is very positive about Freeport and about Freeport working &#x2013; the new Minister of Mines &#x2013; with Codelco. So all of that's good.</p>
          <p>Now, Chile faces the significant reconstruction project from the damage caused by the earthquake and that's affecting the finances for the whole country. They are looking at using some reserve funds, about raising some money in the capital markets, and they're talking about certain increases in taxes and royalties, broadly, not just for the mining industry. And realistically, that's going to have an impact on Codelco for some time and that &#x2013; and we think it provides opportunities for us to expand our relationships with them. So, we're happy for Diego, but we were very pleased with our relationship with Codelco as it's been recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, excellent insight. And my other question, Richard is more strategic in nature. Obviously, you guys have done a lot great things. You've got a &#x2013; you're going to be net debt free by year-end according to our analysis. You've got a 15% free cash yield. You've obviously got a number of excellent projects, organic growth opportunities. My concern is that your stock price is not reflecting this appropriately and there's been a decoupling of the copper price &#x2013; from the copper price and I'm wondering &#x2013; I'm not sure what this is due to &#x2013; it may be due only to, I know there's observers out there that are concerned about China and the macro and think that copper is trading too far away from marginal cost of production, the non-believers if you will. But I'm wondering also is there a concern also that maybe people &#x2013; some people are viewing your growth opportunities as maybe not so much growth, and that Freeport is maybe in more of a mature phase? And is this part of what may be going on? I mean, how &#x2013; shouldn't we think about in addition to organic, should we think about the possibilities &#x2013; you kind of alluded to looking for other opportunities. Should we think about Freeport looking for external growth as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first part of your question, as you noted, there is a lot of skepticism about China. There has been since 2003 about China's internal economy and bubbles in its property sector and just overall concerns about its ability to manage its growth. They've done it very well, their internal economy's doing well, but there's a lot of questions about this issue about the relationship between imports and internal consumption, so that's there. The U.S. continues and the Western world continues to be &#x2013; have this overhang of the economic downturn and issues like Greece and Goldman Sachs over the marketplace. So, it's just part of the world we live in. Longer range, we're very optimistic about China, about ultimately about the recovery and the developed world's economy. We like where our company's placed. We've got growth opportunities. We were focused on liquidity protection beginning in late 2008 and into 2009.</p>
          <p>Now we are shifting gears a bit and we're going to be working diligently on looking for opportunities within our existing sets of assets. We're always alert to other opportunities and over time we're going to &#x2013; as we've done effectively over the years &#x2013; we're going to show the marketplace. I mean, our issue is performance. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance we have in running our business. And we are going to do a great job in taking advantage of opportunities where they come to us, over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that Richard. I certainly am &#x2013; certainly very pleased to see that you're shifting more to the growth and the CapEx and hopefully the stock price will better reflect what you guys have achieved and are achieving. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just a question on kind of potential return of capital to shareholders. I guess, can you just &#x2013; can you just remind us on your comfort level with cash on the balance sheet as far as &#x2013; certainly you're looking at capital spending opportunities going-forward, but what's your comfort range with cash and kind of, how much is too much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have certain amounts of cash that aren't available to us for corporate purposes. But beyond that, we don't see any real needs of maintaining substantial amount of cash within our company. So, we are going to be managing our cash position going-forward by looking as we always do, our forward view of cash flows, our looking for opportunities for investment and then to the extent there is available cash, we'll be talking with our Board about what's the most appropriate way of returning that to shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now one of the &#x2013; one of the most positive things as we think about this issue of the global financial picture, is the availability of financing to us. We've had the opportunity of talking with the financial market players or the banks that we have traditional relationships with. Others are always trying to establish relationships and the availability of capital to our company right now is extraordinary. For example, we have been advised that we would have financial support to &#x2013; during the financing we did three years ago with the Phelps Dodge deal, rates are obviously very attractive today. The capital availability is a really important feature for the marketplace and it's available to us in a very significant way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great and can you &#x2013; I know there's some existing share authorization that's still out there. Can you talk about whether there's a preference there between potential buybacks or special dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just going to &#x2013; we always just look at the marketplace and make decisions on that. We've done both in the past. They are both available to us. And today we've been focused on looking at increasing the dividend, which we had eliminated and then now we've had two steps to increase. But these are issues we get the counsel of our Board on, they're ultimately Board decisions and we review it continually with them at every one of our meetings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just one last one, if I may, on Morenci with the ramp up there I think that gets you back towards 80% of sort of pre-crisis production. If you were to incrementally take that back to kind of full production, is that really just a labor issue to go back to 100%? If you could just flesh out what would be needed there and the timing, that'd be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's more like 70, 75%, rather than 80%. But, yeah, it's not a complicated process we have, it's &#x2013; it is equipment and people. We have available equipment and we were real pleased with our ability to ramp up in terms of hiring, we were able to find a lot of people who had worked for us. So, we &#x2013; it's not a constraint, it's a management issue, but it's not a constraint in terms of stepping up, it's conditions in the marketplace. And we're studying, as I indicated, a couple occasions we're studying the next steps beyond this one. Or I guess it's two; starting the mill and increasing the mining rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could just remind us again what the total capital spending needs are for the underground development in Indonesia? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total extends over many years. We have now invested in building the infrastructure that allows us to get there. We're beginning now to take the initial steps of mine development. We're investing in a rail system for the first time; there will be a shaft development in the underground. Mark, why don't you make some comments on that and maybe Kathleen can talk about some of the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. This is the big year for us. As Richard stated, we are ramping-up our development rates in both the Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ. They're both going to come online almost simultaneously in 2016. At the same time, we're starting up the Big Gossan, we're finishing up the development of that. We'll start production there at the end of this year with our first stoke. So, that's an exciting time for us. We've commissioned the shaft, the overflow system, we're getting the base plant ready and so we're well-positioned there and as Richard said, we're entering a period where &#x2013; this year we're going to have about 45 kilometers drifting for underground development. That peaks out in the 2011 to 2013 timeframe when we get up over 55 kilometers a year and we feel very well-positioned to achieve those targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, in terms of the numbers, the &#x2013; and these are total numbers and we share with share with Rio Tinto &#x2013; and these are amounts that are spent over a long period of time, but for the Grasberg block cave it's just over $3 billion. The Deep MLZ, the initial capital is roughly $2 billion, the Kucing Liar is roughly $2.5 billion, we've also got some mill modifications. But we're looking at spending over the life of the mine in the aggregate ongoing throughout the life of the mine, being around $500 million a year and our share of that being about $350 million a year for that underground development over the life of the mine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then of the block cave &#x2013; the 3, the 2, the 2.5 billion, are those &#x2013; how much is &#x2013; of that has actually been spent at this point and how should we think about that in terms of how it phases in over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been spending, we've been spending at a clip, going back, mainly on the common infrastructure &#x2013; going back for several years now. But we're stepping up now the expenditures on the Grasberg block cave, and again, we're going to be spending &#x2013; our share of spending is going to be in the 350 to $400 million range for the next several years.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the &#x2013; when I talked about this being an underground mine compared with other undeveloped mines, it's really significantly different. Because we do have the mill and the infrastructure built for that. We have the town site, the port system, all of the supporting infrastructure. So, its development really relates to just what Kathleen and Mark were talking about, developing the underground mine as opposed to kind of what you'd be faced if this was a mine that would be a standalone basis, somewhere else in the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to start reporting our cash costs once we get ramped up to the &#x2013; the cobalt ramped up, but in the first quarter our cash costs averaged just over $1 and we're targeting getting to $0.50 or below once we get the cobalt issues resolved and the issues in our SO2 plant resolved. So, we don't think the first quarter really was representative of what we'll be on a run rate basis, but that's what it was.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to ask you, you made a comment about some pockets of demand you are seeing outside China, particularly in the OECD economies. Can you elaborate where &#x2013; where are you seeing and what are you looking at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more in the electrical side of the business, Sal, both here in the U.S. and in Europe. There's some pockets of &#x2013; parts of the economy as you can see, automobile production is one thing that's generating some business for people. When we look at the residential commercial construction business, it's still weak but it's more bottomed out. So, you've got situations of where our downstream customers are not facing further declines in their business, they have very low inventories &#x2013; because the cost of copper and the financial situations, they're not carrying any inventory. So, when they have pieces of their business that generate opportunities, we can see immediate demands for copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what signs are you &#x2013; will you be watching in terms of data of where you feel more confident or comfortable to ramp up further on your projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, copper is so correlated to overall economic output, in the developed world it's closely correlated to industrial production and so as you see, it's the same sort of thing you heard in the JPMorgan report where they were seeing some improvements in their credit card business and the like, all those things come together. So, it's &#x2013; it will be a combination of industrial production employment, business investment when all those things &#x2013; and there's some positive signs with that, as they improve, then you'll see demand for copper stepping up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly on the Tenke Fungurume resolution, any progress anything new over there?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to have very positive discussions. We have not completed those discussions and so there's nothing more to report other than that. So, it's something we are continuing to &#x2013; committed to work with in a way that's beneficial to us in the country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's an ongoing basis. So, it's &#x2013; and the country is dealing with a number of issues now &#x2013; there's been a new government that was formed in the first quarter, a restructuring of the government. The people we work most directly with, the Mines Minister and the Prime Minister are still in their positions. We work with the government, but just to emphasize, we have a contract, we're continuing to work on that contract and get our business operating in the right way, we're working on expansion. So, none of this is holding us back at the present time. We do need to get this resolved, it's in our interest and the government's interest and we're both working to do that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Hey, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm also interested in a little bit of detail about growth, mainly in the Americas. Would you be able to comment at all about what the cash cost profile of the incremental expansions might look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the range of incremental expansions is real broad. And so you can see in the numbers that we disclosed to you today, what the steps we're taking today involve. We talked about at Morenci being on the range of 0.08 to $0.10 of incremental cost to do the stripping that's necessary to step up our mine rates there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But from a cash cost to production basis, once the &#x2013; once it was in there, just looking at these numbers, you're currently running at about a 2 billion pound run rate in the Americas if you lump everything together and they're pretty close on a cash cost &#x2013; site and delivery at about $1.15 if I'm not mistaken? And so, what would that 2 billion maybe look like five years out and at what cash cost, maybe, is a better way to frame the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mark. You're asking me a really broad range question.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I realize that but -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to give you a real broad range answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our &#x2013; as we look out at the major expansion projects, we think that those will come in with cash costs that's consistent with our current cash cost levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's going be there, where we do. The issue will be the amount of capital that's required to develop those because once you start talking about milling facilities for sulfide resources, that's a lot of capital. But we would be looking at resources that should be able to be produced at attractive cash costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me here make a comment about the sulfide ore &#x2013; and we've talked a lot about the &#x2013; whether we're in the South America, North America &#x2013; any of these deposits. Remember, we talked about it in one of our other calls. I made the example, if you look at this as a big pear sitting in the ground and these &#x2013; part of the pear that's exposed is the oxide ore, which is really just a small part of the pear that's gotten ripened by the exposure to the weathering, et cetera. So, you got this big sulfide ore, whether you talk about South America or North America, underneath all these oxide ores you're going to have a substantial sulfide ore. Now, that means that you've deepened the pit, you've widened the pit, you &#x2013; mine the bridges in the pit, especially at Morenci, to increase your production.</p>
          <p>As Richard said, the most important thing is the capital outlay because the reason why the oxide ores are being mined is a preference, especially the sulfidized properties, and by putting in the leach pads, eliminating the necessity of the mill and smelting really puts the oxide ores into prominence. We were talking about much lower copper prices. So, I think that it goes without saying, if there's a huge amount of ore which we drilled up since we made the acquisition, that has confirmed the sulfide ore that hadn't been mined by Phelps Dodge or by anybody because of the fact that when you're looking back at $1 copper or less, a lot of people thought and actually said copper was a long-range price, so all that psychology has changed substantially. So, I think that answers to the question you just asked, is you got to put into perspective the fact that sulfide ore is more expensive to mine; not so much in the cash cost of production. But when you look at the outlay of cash to get yourself into production, the mills are obviously more expensive than leach pads and that's just a matter of fact. But the amount of ore we've talked about being able to access is basically five, six, seven times the amount of oxide ore that existed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great and thanks for that Jim Bob and as we think about, again this is a little bit broad, from a 2 billion pounds, like is 2.5 billion pounds a reasonable expectation based on the projects you've outlined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, we are going to be studying to maximize what these resources are available to us. It's going to be an ongoing process of where we're going to continuing to do analysis and work to decide where to go forward. But the potential for a significant growth is there and we believe the market's going to allow us to produce it.</p>
          <p>I'll go back to one thing I said earlier, the first major expansion opportunity that we're going to have is going to be at Cerro Verde. And we think a year from now we'll be &#x2013; we'll have completed our feasibility study and we'll be preparing to more than double the production from that mine. So, that's the first one. Tenke Fungurume will be working in the meantime. We're going to be an incremental studies of how we can enhance our near-term production and look for opportunities to make these kind of major investments that Jim Bob and I have been talking with you about, to have the significant kind of future increases that are available to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Cerro Verde alone would go a long way to what's you're talking about, Mark. One other comment, just on our mineralized material, we reported 122 billion pounds of mineralized material, a lot of that is in North America, over 70 billion pounds that contain copper is in North America and in sulfide material. And so, that's just back to the point that we were making about the great opportunity we have in North America on milling.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John. We've planned to do some work this summer, we have some pipeline corridor work that we've had planned to do when the weather permits, that we'll do this summer. So, that was already in our plans to continue our construction efforts although at a minimum rate, but we'll plan to do that as the weather permits this summer. So, we are going to be active this summer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you could be up and running in the second-half of '011 then?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're talking about &#x2013; that's unlikely at this stage. So, it's &#x2013; as we sit, look today at the likelihood, it would be beginning after the summer of 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then the second point refers to the security situation at Grasberg, I know that you've done a lot work on this and taken lot of steps and we've even here, heard here stories about Russian-trained sniffer dogs, that quite honestly sound frightening to me. But as the situation stands today, do you feel that you have to take any further steps in regard to security or is any particular body that you feel &#x2013; local body that you need to sit down and talk to or as the situation stands today, are you happy with the security situation at Grasberg on an ongoing basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the dogs are American-trained, some of them are German &#x2013; obviously the German Shepherds &#x2013; but they're just part of the process that we've had bring in resources to this. We had a shooting event in January. We've actually had two in the last six months. We had hoped that all the work that it been done last fall would have ended this situation, but we did have the other event in January, but not once since then.</p>
          <p>The government has put resources on this. We've recently entered into a memorandum of understanding with the security forces. We're encouraged by their improved organization and commitment to it. We've adopted, with the advice of the security consultants, procedures for transporting people and equipment on our road. To say we're satisfied, we're not satisfied because the investigation into the perpetrators of this has not been completed or they have not been found.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the enhanced security. Our people there have great morale. They feel good about it. We're not losing people as a result of this. But, we are continuing to encourage the authorities to complete their investigation and get to the bottom of this and bring the people who are doing this terrible thing, to justice.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we &#x2013; we're producing it &#x2013; we actually produce cobalt at a good rate in the first quarter, we had roughly 5 million pounds of production. The quality of the cobalt, while it's marketable, it's not to the standards that we want it to be and we're getting some discount on that, but we will &#x2013; the way to look at it, is the life-of-mine rate design capacity is rough &#x2013; 18 million pounds a year and during the early years we'll produce 20 to 25 million pounds a year beginning in '010 and '011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A question on the sales profile, like the 2012. I noticed 2012 you're talking about gold sales of 1.4 million ounces, which presumably reflects lower grades at Grasberg. I'm just wondering, copper sales of around 4 million pounds, what would the composition of that be? Like I assume that if gold grades are down in Grasberg, copper grades would be down. So was that kind of made up more with North American &#x2013; South American production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I tell you, we have &#x2013; and this is a legacy Freeport disclosure, but if you'll go back to slide 28, we have a five-year plan for PTFI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it shows copper and gold grades &#x2013; the copper and gold production. This issue about the variance of the grades of the material at the core of the Grasberg versus at higher elevations, is more pronounced for gold than it is for copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's just a function of the mineralization, it's just a such an incredible ore body from a grade standpoint, that when you're at the heart of it in this Golden Horseshoe that we've talked about for years, you get extraordinary grades for copper, but really eye-popping grades for gold. So, it's &#x2013; it is more pronounced the variations as you can see on this slide, on page 28.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, one more quick question if I could. I noticed in the quarter &#x2013; quarter compensation of taxes, I mean, effectively all-cash taxes or a small deferred tax. Is that going be kind of ongoing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax situation always depends on the relative contribution of taxable income in different areas, we've reported a consolidated tax, but we pay tax by country. And so, when copper prices are low, because we have a corporate overhead and costs here, we pay very little U.S. tax, but a lot of tax in Indonesia. With higher prices, we generate taxable income everywhere we operate. So that's what you're seeing as the &#x2013; as a consequence of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, I might just add to the comment about the gold grades. When we go underground, interestingly enough, we've discussed with you before, that if you don't mind the waste material in the profile &#x2013; of the ore extraction will change significantly when we get underground, as you're really basically taking the Golden Horseshoe and you're block caving that. So, you don't take out the high walls and the symmetry of mining that we've had to deal with for the last 20 years in the open pit, is significantly different. So, suffice it to say that when you see these gold grades going up and down as we move from the center of the open pit, up to the high walls to keep the symmetry, that's when it has the most impact on the gold grade. Once you get underground and get the block cave going, both &#x2013; both for underground operations, where we hope to reach 240,000 tons a day, you're going to have more predictable gold grades as you stay out of the waste material.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jim Bob. And I'll point out to everyone; when you get your annual reports, there'll be a table in there that shows each one of our ore &#x2013; our underground ore bodies that will have the copper, and it's in the 10-K as well, so you can go onto the Web and see it &#x2013; but it has each one of our underground ore bodies and it has the copper and gold grades for it.</p>
          <p>One of the things you'll notice is in the KL ore body and some of that extends into the Grasberg block cave is we have low recoveries of some ore that's affected by pyrite, in fact, we are only predicting right now 50% recovery. So, one of the opportunities that we have long-range is to deal with the metallurgical analysis and processing of this ore and get more gold out of these &#x2013; this ore than we currently can establish under the criteria for reporting proved and probable reserves; but there's a lot more detail on that in our supplemental disclosures, in our 10-K.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Richard, you talked about restarting the Climax mine, I think it might take about two summers for you to restart that &#x2013; the project. Are you concerned that &#x2013; are you not concerned that restarting that might put extra molybdenum into the market or do you think that the molybdenum strength is such strong that it will not have an adverse impact on the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is the reason we suspended the construction, if we hadn't had that concern, we would have gone forward with it because the project is &#x2013; is really a home run in today's molybdenum prices, but it is 30 million pounds in a market that's approaching 450 million pounds. So, that is the issue that we're monitoring because we do produce significant moly from our &#x2013; as by-products from our copper mines and so as we get comfortable that the market can absorb this moly, that will be the trigger for us to go forward. But sure, we have that concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The chart that you showed of moly 65 million pounds, currently for 2011, 2012, does this include Climax or it does not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, the Climax might be in 2013 in that case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we talked about, if we were to begin construction in the summer of 2011, by the end of 2012 we would be producing moly from Climax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the moly market from the beginning of the year till now have you seen an acceleration or a momentum in terms of the moly demand or how would you characterize that market now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can answer that, but I've got the expert here, Dave Thornton, who will be commenting on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We're seeing good demand growth in the molybdenum markets primarily if you compare to last year, it's night and day. Last year we were seeing U.S. steel utilization rates in the 40, 50% range. First quarter of 2010, we were in the high 60 to 70% utilization rates, auto sales increasing in the U.S. and in China, that's a good demand source for steel and also some molybdenum outlets on autos. So, we are seeing some signs of strength in metallurgical markets, we're also seeing improved strengths in our chemical markets for molybdenum, primarily in the catalyst for desulphurization. So, we're seeing some signs of improvement, but not quite back to where we were in 2008, yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the improvements largely coming broadly across the U.S. or mainly from the developing markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's across &#x2013; mainly driven by China, but we're seeing some demand improvements in the West as well, U.S. and Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the copper side you mentioned that a lot of &#x2013; you would be going underground of course by 2015 in Grasberg. When you &#x2013; as you increase your production in the underground, do you think that there might be an increase in the cost of underground, in the average cost at the Grasberg mine, currently you have very low cost at Grasberg mine because of the by-product credits. But as you move more and more underground is there a reason for us to think that there might be a cost increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's going to be &#x2013; it depends on a number of factors. If we look at the current cost structure of the industry there would be some increase in cost, but you'd still have these high levels of production at a net cash cost of less than $0.50 a pound. There have been times with varying energy costs when our models actually showed underground being cheaper, because you use a lot less diesel. But if you look at the current cost levels and we think about a life-of-mine average for the pit of being in the range of $0.30, say, at 1 million-plus pounds of copper, and $1,000 &#x2013; well, at the open pit it would be less than 25%. At a $1,000-plus goal, which would be another factor that will determine it, you're still talking about costs in the range of 0.30, $0.35 a pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, very attractive cost level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've said a while ago, remember, when you talk about going underground, the costs going up, the offset is we should just say there's a &#x2013; you use a lot less diesel for all of these trucks that are no longer all in that waste-away, because remember we talked about the underground mining taking only the ore. So, your gold rates don't vary like they do in the open pit and therefore your by-product credits stay more predictable. So, you've got less of a truck fleet, which obviously reduces all the costs that are associated with operating all those trucks and you stay in the core of the ore body and don't have to deal with the waste. That's really the offset of why the costs don't vary appreciably &#x2013; now, if we would have had the by-product, that would be a different story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Just one question will be probably on -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more factor on underground, it's much more of a manufacturing- like process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, there's more of a repetition of the way you operate on a day-to-day basis and because of that, there's tremendous opportunities for technology to improve the cost structure underground. I've talked with Caterpillar and other suppliers and they are investing in that right now, other operators, because the industry is going to be characterized as being much more heavily underground than it is today, because of just where the resources are in the future. So, we are going to be working and looking at ways of using technology and I think that's a great opportunity for managing costs as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Because we've addressed it on a couple of occasions. We continue to have positive conversations with the representative governments. There's a lot of issues going on within the country. They've restructured their government, but we are engaged in ongoing discussions, which we believe will result in a successful resolution for this for us and for the &#x2013; for us and for the country.</p>

          <p>And again I'll emphasize, we are operating under our contract everyday. We're working to produce copper efficiently. We're doing that. We're working to improve our cobalt circuit, we're making progress. We've got hundreds of trucks tracking back and forth between the port, carrying copper down and supplies back and so it's &#x2013; we're operating as we speak, and we are investing in our next expansion project.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Justine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have a question on the U.S. cost. I know that the projections that you guys talk about in the press release are net of moly by-products, et cetera. But they still seem a little bit higher than what &#x2013; what they were before and I'm assuming that because you're restarting some of the higher cost capacity. So, before we take into account the by-product credits, can we expect costs in the U.S. to go back up to what they were, let's say, in '08, which is closer to $2 a pound as opposed to the low $1 a pound level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The answer is no. We're not going to let the costs go up to $2. In 2009, Justine, our North American cost net of by-product credits was $1.11. In our first &#x2013; in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call we had given an 2010 estimate of $1.23. We're updating that to a $1.24 today. So, even though we're talking about spending some additional money, we are &#x2013; we're going to keep our unit costs down. We are seeing, because as I mentioned, because of the mining more material and stripping at Morenci, that that will add some cost. We're showing cost before by-product credits of $1.50, three months ago we said it would be $1.45. So, basically there, that reflects the decisions we're making today. So, there's some change to it, but it's not any kind of radically different cost structure than we've talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it'll be more in the midpoint, but it certainly won't go back-up to those levels even if you bring back the higher cost, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not really a midpoint. I mean, we were close $2, we're talking about $1.24 now. But at the time we were talking about close to $2, we were looking at copper at $1.50 a pound and a lot of people thought it was going lower. Today, we've got copper at $3.50 a pound, some people think to go lower and higher. But my point is these changes we're seeing in our costs are proportionately &#x2013; proportionally much, much lower than the changes we're seeing in the realizations of our products. And so, our profitability is expanding by an amazing level.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then just one more for Kathleen, obviously you guys have brought that down to around $5 billion after the takeout of the floaters and I'm just wondering if there is any other color that Moody's has given you guys as to what you might do in order to work on an investment grade rating. I know that reducing total debt had been something. I mean, is there anything else, besides waiting? Is there any other benchmark they've set out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and I think you can just read their report and see what things that they've been looking at and we have ongoing dialog with Moody's and we're going to continue to do what we think makes sense for our balance sheet and ultimately that we believe should give us an investment grade rating, but we'll let them complete their analysis.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was curious when &#x2013; looking at the capital expenditure expectations for the year with 1.7 billion for the full year, yet we have 230 million in the first quarter, that implies a larger than the &#x2013; a larger balance in each of the following three quarters. What way do you expect that to flow through, do you expect it to be roughly equal or towards the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll vary just depending on when we get things done. This is a cash expenditure, so equipment's being ordered, things are being done and so it's not a smooth situation you're talking about. Activities is varied as replacement equipment for Morenci and building an underground shaft and the railroad system in Indonesia. So, it's across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at it right now, we show it evenly distributed within the next three quarters, but as is the case when we're ramping up capital, usually it does get delayed quarter-to-quarter, but as of right now for planning purposes, it's pretty evenly distributed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I apologize if I missed this earlier in the call, but in the past, there have been discussions between Freeport and the Indonesian government about the sale back to the Indonesian government of the 9.36% stake of Grasberg? When we last spoke on the conference call prior to this one, you indicated that really nothing had happened recently with regard to that proposed sale. However, since then there's been press stories indicating that the government expects it could take place this year, I was hoping that you could provide an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just clarify a couple of points. We have a contact of work, which under its terms does not require us to divest of any of our interest in PTFI. There were provisions in the contract to that effect when it was signed in 1991. But under its terms, those have fallen away. So there's no requirement. The Indonesian government has asked us to voluntarily consider offering this interest that you refer to, just under 10% to Indonesian interest. That was several years ago. The central government itself has indicated that it is not interested in buying incremental shares, they currently own just under 10%. We have &#x2013; the discussions you referred to have been with the province of Papua, which has an interest in buying those shares and we see some strategic &#x2013; potential strategic benefits of working to achieve that, so that Papuans have a share ownership interest, we provide significant support to that community already through various programs and we're committed to continuing to do that.</p>
          <p>There's some structural issues associated with accomplishing that and we're continuing to address those in a very cooperative and positive way. It's really too early to say when this might happen or how this might happen, but it would be in a way that would not be detrimental to the FCX shareholders. And it would be something that we believe, if we're successful in doing this under the structure we're talking about, that it could have some positive strategic benefits in terms of our relationships with province of Papua and the people of Papua.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally coming back to Kathleen's earlier comment about &#x2013; about Moody's, Moody's in the past has indicated that they would like to see a little bit less concentration at Freeport in Indonesia. Do you think the sale of that 9.36% stake would further that ability to appear less concentrated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no that's &#x2013; that wouldn't affect that analysis at all, as we &#x2013; as we discussed with Moody's when they raised that issue several years ago, we've now through the Phelps Dodge deal, significantly reduced the concentration of this company in Indonesia because now it's a third to 40% of our business, as before where it was 100%. So, we do have this &#x2013; this geographical diversification now, but Indonesia is an important part of our business and it's our cornerstone asset. The financial community's view of Indonesia, as you may know, has really improved.</p>
          <p>So, Indonesia's economy has performed well, it's had the &#x2013; its stock market during this downturn has been the second best performing stock market in the world and the country is committed to improving its investment climate. So, over time we think the &#x2013; but first of all, the world's view of Indonesia has improved and will continue to improve and at some point we will be able to demonstrate to Moody's that we are indeed an investment grade-rated company as the rest of the world seems to view us.</p>
