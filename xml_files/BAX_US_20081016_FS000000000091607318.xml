          <p>Thanks Sean, and good morning everyone, and welcome to our Q3 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Parkinson, CEO and Chairman of Baxter International; and Rob Davis, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, let me remind you that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook, new product developments and regulatory matters, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>In addition, in today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mary Kay.  Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. We're pleased today to announce very strong financial performance for the third quarter. While Rob will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in just a few minutes, I'd like to take a moment to highlight just a few key points.</p>
          <p>First of all, our financial performance this quarter reflects many of the themes that we've discussed with all of you over the last several quarters. Not only did we exceed expectations in all of the key financial metrics, we are continuing to leverage our diversified healthcare model capitalizing on our broad global presence and accelerating the pace of R&amp;D spending.</p>
          <p>As you saw this morning, adjusted EPS of $0.88 exceeded guidance for the quarter and increased 26% versus last year. Sales growth after adjusting out for FX was 9% and I think it's worth highlighting that our international sales growth was very robust. And again, after adjusting for foreign currency increased 12% with all of our international regions outside the U.S. growing in double-digits. I think that this continues to demonstrate the value and strength of our diversified business model. It reinforces our strategy and illustrates the market potential for further global expansion.</p>
          <p>Adjusted gross margins was 50.6% and operating income as a percentage of sales was 22% and importantly, we are achieving this performance, while also investing in key marketing and promotional activities along with R&amp;D programs that will position us for growth over the longer term.</p>
          <p>And finally, our company continues to generate healthy cash flow, a tribute to the focus throughout the organization on managing this very important metric. Our financial strength and flexibility provides us with a solid foundation in this uncertain global economy.</p>
          <p>One of our key challenges continues to be the COLLEAGUE pump. As you saw in our press release this morning, we recorded a special charge to increase our COLLEAGUE remediation reserves. This charge primarily accounts for increased repair cost and modifications related to our decision to harmonize the global install base on a software platform consistent with our impending 510(k) regulatory filing. We continue to be in active dialogue with the FDA relative to additional software modifications, which include the buffer issue that we previously discussed, the submission of our 510(k) and the protocol for executing a comprehensive clinical evaluation of pump enhancements. As always, I'd be happy to take any questions that you might have on COLLEAGUE during the Q&amp;A this morning.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Rob, I'd like to take just a few minutes to discuss some recent highlights on several new product and R&amp;D initiatives as we advance our pipeline through both internal development and external collaborations. First, within our regenerative medicine business, we continue to augment our biosurgery portfolio. During the third quarter, we announced a licensing agreement with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals for exclusive U.S. marketing rights for their gentamicin surgical implant. This is the first biodegradable antibiotic surgical sponge used as an adjunct therapy for prevention and treatment of surgical site infections. This product is already approved and available in 49 countries and is currently in two Phase III clinical trials in the United States.</p>
          <p>Also within regenerative medicine, we are advancing programs and achieving milestones with our partners, Kuros Biosurgery AG. This partnership is focused on the development and commercialization of the portfolio of hard and soft tissue repair products. These products will be based on Baxter's fibrin-based biomatrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, combined with Kuros proprietary biologics and associated binding technology. Our development partner Kuros is currently enrolling patients in a number of Phase II clinical programs, which if successful and confirmed in Phase III trials, will allow us to enter the fast growing orthobiologic market.</p>
          <p>Third, we've submitted an IND [investigational new drug] to the FDA for the evaluation of GAMMAGARD LIQUID combined with enhanced Halozyme's proprietary drug delivery technology that can facilitate the absorption and dispersion of drugs subcutaneously. This will be a 12-month Phase III trial for patients with primary immune deficiency. Subcutaneous administration of GAMAMGARD LIQUID via a single site could allow patients to administer a sufficient dose of IGIV once monthly at home. We expect to begin this trial by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we initiated a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the use of GAMMAGARD LIQUID for multifocal motor neuropathy or MMN. MMN is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive limb weakness, primarily affecting the upper extremities. This trial is a 15 month randomized double-blinded placebo control study involving 40 patients. These are just a few of the initiatives that represent our increasingly robust new product pipeline.</p>
          <p>In closing, we believe that Baxter is very well positioned in today's global macroeconomic environment. While we're certainly not without challenges of our own, the progress that we've made over the last several years to improve the quality of our balance sheet and financial performance will yield great benefits in the coming months and years. Our company continues to benefit from the power of our diversified healthcare model with each of the businesses and regions making significant contributions to our overall performance.</p>
          <p>And as I've mentioned in the past, given the medically necessary nature of our products, our strong market positions further supported by our global brand and presence we're confident in our ability to drive solid operational performance and grow despite the uncertain economic times. As always, I'd be happy to take any questions that you might have during the Q&amp;A and in the meantime, let me turn the call over to Rob for a more detailed discussion of our Q3 results and also outlook for the remainder of 2008. Rob?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Before providing our outlook for Q4, I'd like to start today by quickly reviewing with you the charges we recorded in the third quarter, which are reflected in our GAAP results and then discuss our adjusted earnings excluding charges in both the current and prior year periods.</p>
          <p>Please refer to page eight of our press release which reconciles our reported GAAP earnings to our adjusted earnings. First, as Bob mentioned, we recorded an after-tax charge of $65 million or $0.10 per diluted share to increase our COLLEAGUE remediation reserves, to harmonize our pump software and address increasing repair and warranty costs.</p>
          <p>In addition, our third quarter GAAP results include an after-tax $19 million charge or $0.03 per diluted share for fixed asset write offs associated with the discontinuation of the CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program within Medication Delivery. This step reflects our disciplined approach to R&amp;D milestone and program management as the marginal return on this program did not justify further investment.</p>
          <p>And finally, as we've previously indicated, our results reflect an after-tax charge of $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share for in-process research and development related to our new collaboration with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals. In summary, our reported GAAP earnings of $0.74 per diluted share increased 21% over the prior year period. Excluding charges in both the current and prior year, adjusted earnings of $0.88 per diluted share compared favorably to the earnings guidance we previously provided of $0.81 to $0.83, and represented an increase of 26% over the prior year period.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted results reflect better than expected sales and gross margin and a $0.02 benefit resulting from discrete items impacting the tax rate I'll get into in just a little bit. Now, I'll walk you briefly through the P&amp;L by line item, before updating you on the financial outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, our reported sales totaled approximately $3.2 billion and increased 15%. Excluding foreign currency, sales growth of 9% exceeded our guidance for the quarter of 6 to 8% led by better than expected recombinant sales, robust growth across all major product categories within BioScience and strong international growth in Medication Delivery.</p>
          <p>Organic growth this quarter also represents a sequential acceleration of approximately four points as we've now annualized several items that created difficult growth comparisons for us over the past year or so. Sales growth in the U.S. was 5%, driven by double-digit sales growth in BioScience. International sales, which comprised 60% of our total reported sales, increased 22% with strong growth across all regions and major product categories.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, sales increased 12% and sales growth excluding foreign currency was 5%. Excluding foreign currency, the loss of BeneFIX and the sales of the Transfusion Therapies business, sales growth was 7% on a year-to-date basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of individual business performance, let me start with Medication Delivery, which had sales totaling approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 11%. Currency contributed 5 percentage points of growth. Therefore excluding foreign currency, Medication Delivery sales grew 6%. International sales were again robust and increased 21% driven by double-digit increases across all businesses with international sales excluding foreign currency increasing 12%. U.S sales in Medication Delivery were flat as solid growth in IV therapies and infusion systems offset the performance in the U.S. anesthesia and injectables businesses.</p>
          <p>As we discussed last quarter, the decline of 4% in the U.S. injectables business continues to be the result of competition from multi-source generics and the impact of heparin, which was somewhat offset by growth of our enhanced packaging product offerings. The injectables business outside the U.S. grew in double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven primarily from growth of our drug compounding businesses.</p>
          <p>Anesthesia sales totaled $112 million, an increase of 1% and excluding foreign currency, declined 1%. Double-digit international growth continues to be driven by penetration of SUPRANE, our proprietary anesthetic, augmented by growth of Sevoflurane. U.S. sales growth was impacted by the timing of wholesaler purchases as well as a difficult comparison to last year when U.S. sales growth exceeded 40%.</p>
          <p>Global IV therapy sales totaled $403 million and increased 16%, with currency contributing six percentage points of growth. Growth continues to be driven by solid demand for IV solutions globally, U.S. pricing improvements, and strong growth in our nutritions business.</p>
          <p>Infusion systems sales totaled $235 million in the quarter and increased 14% or 11% excluding foreign currency. Sales benefited from solid growth of access sets, U.S. remediation revenues for COLLEAGUE, and COLLEAGUE placements in international markets.</p>
          <p>In summary, for Medication Delivery, we continue to expect full year sales excluding foreign currency to grow approximately 4%. This will be driven by flat sales versus the prior year in our global injectables business, growth of approximately 5% for our infusion systems business, IV therapy sales growth in mid to high single-digits and we expect anesthesia to grow in the low double-digits, primarily driven by strong international growth.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Renal, third quarter sales totaled approximately $600 million and increased 6%, with foreign currency contributing seven percentage points of growth. U.S. sales declined 1% and international sales increased 7%. Global PD sales totaled $480 million and increased 7%. Excluding foreign currency, Global PD sales were flat due to the lost tender in Mexico we've previously discussed. Excluding both the impact of the lost tender and foreign currency, international PD sales were up approximately 5%, and Global PD sales also increased 5%. This growth is due to the expanded use of peritoneal dialysis in many developed and emerging markets around the world.</p>
          <p>In international markets, we continue to see PD patient growth in the double-digits in Asia, led by consistent growth of approximately 25% in China along with solid patient growth in other developing countries around the world. In the U.S., PD sales growth of 6% was again driven by patient gains. Hemodialysis sales of $113 million increased 1%, and excluding foreign currency, sales declined by 5%.</p>
          <p>To summarize, Renal continues to perform in line with our expectations. Full year 2008, we continue to expect Renal sales excluding foreign currency to be approximately flat. This is primarily the result of lower PD growth due to the lost PD tender in Mexico late last year. Adjusting for this, Renal sales growth would be in the mid single-digits, demonstrating continued progress in the core PD franchise across other markets.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to BioScience, BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.4 billion generating record quarterly growth of 23%. This growth includes six percentage points of benefit from foreign currency. This performance is the result of accelerating sales across the portfolio resulting in double-digit increases for all major product categories.</p>
          <p>Recombinant sales of $516 million increased 19% or 14% excluding foreign currency. As we have previously mentioned, ADVATE sales continue to exceed our expectations, with ADVATE conversion in Europe at over 90% and U.S. conversion improving to approximately 65%. U.S. recombinant sales were up 7%, and international sales increased 30%. The international performance was better than expected primarily due to timing of orders and the acceleration of tenders in the ischemia region.</p>
          <p>Turning to the plasma business, in the quarter, plasma protein sales of $338 million increased 37%, with currency benefiting sales by 11 percentage points. Performance continues to be driven by the ongoing double-digit growth in global demand for plasma proteins and improved pricing. U.S. Plasma protein sales increased 7%, while international sales increased 59%. As we discussed last quarter, strong international growth was expected due to a difference year-over-year in the timing of shipments for FEIBA and PD factor VIII tenders in the Latin American and ischemia markets.</p>
          <p>Antibody therapy sales increased 25% and totaled $307 million, with currency benefiting sales by three percentage points. Growth was once again driven by conversion to GAMMAGARD LIQUID, pricing improvements, and strong growth in demand.</p>
          <p>Sales of our regenerative medicine business totaled $104 million and increased 27%, with currency contributing six percentage points of growth. This is the result of growth of our core portfolio of products; TISSEEL, FLOSEAL and COSEAL.</p>
          <p>Finally, revenues in the other category totaled $89 million and declined 5%. This decline is primarily due a tough comparison for the vaccines business in the quarter and a decline in lower margin third-party plasma sales.</p>
          <p>In summary, BioScience growth through the first nine months of the year has been both balanced and robust across the entire portfolio. Therefore, we expect BioScience sales excluding foreign currency to exceed 10% for the full year. This growth is comprised of the following. First, recombinant sales growth in high single-digits. Second, we expect plasma protein and antibody therapy sales in total to grow in the mid-to-high teens, given solid demand and higher prices. Third, we continue to expect growth in our biosurgery business to be in the mid-teens. And finally, we expect the other category to decline in mid single-digits for the year versus our prior year expectation of a double-digit decline. This change is the result of a strong year-to-year performance in the vaccines business, augmented by a benefit from a large tender expected in the fourth quarter. The strong vaccine sales for the year of approximately $450 million will be more than offset by the difficult comparison for BeneFIX, resulting in the mid single-digit decline for the category.</p>
          <p>Turning to the rest of the P&amp;L and starting with gross margin; gross margin in the quarter of 50.6% improved by 60 basis points versus last year. This performance reflected a significant improvement over our expectation for the quarter of flat margins year-over-year, primarily due to timing and mix resulting from better than expected sales of higher margin products in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Margin expansion is the continued result of improved business and product mix, including conversion to ADVATE and GAMMAGARD LIQUID, favorable pricing across multiple businesses, and manufacturing efficiencies. These drivers continue to offset a modest impact from rising raw material cost and a slight negative impact on margin percentage from currency fluctuations. For the fourth quarter, we expect these operational trends to continue, resulting in a gross margin that's slightly higher than Q3, and reflecting continued margin expansion year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Turning to SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A of $681 million in the quarter increased 12% compared to prior year. This growth includes approximately five percentage points of growth in foreign currency. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales is 21.6%, reflecting a 50 basis point reduction versus the prior year period. As Bob mentioned earlier, R&amp;D spending of $218 million increased 30%, and as a ratio of to sales was almost 7%.</p>
          <p>Excluding foreign currency, R&amp;D growth was over 20%, driven by significant growth in BioScience and double-digit increases in Medication Delivery and Renal. As our results indicate, we continue to invest for the longer term, while continuing to meet our short-term objectives. As evidence of this, despite significant growth in R&amp;D, our operating margin for the quarter was 22%.</p>
          <p>Interest expense was $20 million compared to $6 million last year. This increase is primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates and the settlement of net investment hedges as well as increased expense on debt issued within the last 12 months. Other expense was 1 million in the quarter as miscellaneous expenses and minority interest were offset by foreign currency gains.</p>
          <p>As I indicated earlier, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.3% and lower than our guidance of 19%. While our underlying effective tax rate remains at approximately 19%, the lower rate in the quarter was the result of favorable accounting adjustments due to valuation allowances, which were somewhat offset by tax expense associated with foreign earnings that we plan to repatriate to the U.S. Net-net, this resulted in a $0.02 benefit for the quarter. Finally, as previously mentioned, EPS of $0.88 represented an increase of 26%.</p>
          <p>Moving now to cash flow; cash flow from operations for the quarter totaled $813 million and for the year, we've generated approximately $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations. This is an improvement of over $300 million versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our total DSO, which ended the quarter at 55.6 days, improved versus last quarter and was three days lower than last year. Inventory turns of 2.4 turns were also better than last quarter and last year. Sequentially, BioScience and Renal turns improved, while turns within Medication Delivery remained relatively flat.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $251 million compared to $166 million in the third quarter last year as we continued to invest in appropriate capacity across our businesses to support our future growth. I am also pleased to let you know that during the quarter we made our last payment of approximately $240 million and we have now completely terminated the net investment hedge liability.</p>
          <p>And lastly, during the quarter we repurchased 8.5 million shares of common stock for $589 million. So far this year, we have repurchased 24 million shares, totaling $1.5 billion. On a net basis, this amounts to repurchases totaling 11.2 million shares for $1 billion in line with our commitment on a net basis for the year.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm particularly pleased with our ongoing ability to generate strong cash flows. We continue to return significant value to shareholders as a result of our improved financial flexibility, capital allocation discipline, and financial management, while accelerating investments in R&amp;D both internally and through business development activities that will position us for future growth.</p>
          <p>Now, before turning to the financial outlook for the remainder of the year, given the recent developments in the financial markets, I'd like to share some important points about Baxter. Fortunately, as you know we have spent a number of years improving the overall profile of our financial performance and strengthening our balance sheet. So, we believe we are well positioned in this uncertain economy. We continue to generate strong operating cash flow, which provides the flexibility to fund our operations without the need to access the short-term debt markets.</p>
          <p>With significant cash on hand of over $2 billion both in the U.S. and internationally, along with increased flexibility to repatriate cash as needed, our liquidity position remains very strong. We have access to the commercial paper market at reasonable rates if needed, and we maintain a backup credit facility with committed lines of credit of $1.5 billion, which does not mature until 2011 and another facility of &#x20AC;300 million, which does not mature until 2013. Overall, the credit issues currently impacting the financial markets do not pose a meaningful risk to our operations and funding requirements.</p>
          <p>Given the recent market volatility and drastic movements in currency rates in the last several weeks, I also want to address the ongoing impact of foreign currency. As we have previously indicated, to-date we have seen a modest benefit on our results. While it's somewhat premature to speculate on 2009 given these drastic movements, particularly in the Latin American currencies, which we cannot directly hedge, we could face some foreign currency headwind next year. Overall, however, we continue to be confident in our margin expansion opportunities and growth profile, driving results at a minimum consistent with our long range objectives despite the current uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on our financial outlook for the remainder of 2008. As you saw in the press release this morning, we raised our earnings guidance to $3.35 to $3.37 per share. Our previous earnings guidance was $3.28 to $3.32 per share. For full year 2008, we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency to be in the five to 6% range. Foreign currency for the full year is expected to benefit sales growth by approximately four points, with reported sales growth expected to be in the 10% range.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we expect gross profit to improve year-over-year by approximately 150 basis points, with SG&amp;A growth of approximately 10%, and R&amp;D growth of approximately 20%.  Based on this guidance, we expect our operating margin to improve for the year 2008 by approximately 100 basis points to nearly 22%.</p>
          <p>We now expect interest and other expense combined to total approximately $100 million. We expect interest expense to total more than $80 million as a result of exiting net investment hedges, lower interest income, and lower balances of cash. While we expect our operational tax rate to approximate 19% for the year due to the discrete items that drove the tax rate lower in Q3 and a modest benefit of approximately $0.01 related to the 2008 R&amp;D tax credit, which will be implemented in the fourth quarter. The full year adjusted tax rate is expected to approximate 18%. We continue to expect a full year average share count of 635 to 640 million shares and we now expect cash flow from operations to exceed $2.6 billion and capital expenditures to approximate $1 billion.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, we expect R&amp;D earnings per diluted share of $0.88 to $0.90 and sales growth excluding foreign currency of approximately 7%. While we cannot precisely predict currency fluctuations, assuming current rates, foreign currency could negatively impact fourth quarter sales by approximately two points.</p>
          <p>In summary thus far this year, we've achieved or exceeded our financial objectives, while the macroeconomic environment may be more challenging in the coming months and years ahead given our balanced, diversified portfolio, global brand and geographic presence. We are confident in our ability to deliver operational growth, consistent with our long range objectives, now I'd like to open the call up for Q and A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Good morning. Couple questions, I usually don't get on this quick. First, Bob on the &#x2013; on the fourth quarter comments, I think &#x2013; or Rob you said that there would a vaccine contract or sort of a one time benefit from a product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is a &#x2013; that's actually a tender, very consistent what we've done in the past it's an advanced purchase agreement. I don't want a disclose the country because right now we're under some confidentiality agreements with them, but it will be a one time tender in the quarter of probably about $50 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you at least say, because usually those are pretty high margin tenders is that realistic to think about as...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this will be a relatively high margin tender.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then the second question is on this &#x2013; the PD contract in Mexico. Is that coming up for tender again in '09 and if so, is there a chance that you would potentially bid on it or it could be a better contract there to allow you to get back in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yes Matt, this is Bob, it is coming up we actually expect to receive the tender for '09 shortly. We don't know all the terms and what's changed from last year given frankly what's transpired in the marketplace with the conversion last year and so on. So, we will definitely participate in that tender. Relative to the financial impact going forward obviously as we all know, we took a major hit in '08. We're obviously hopeful that on a year-to-year basis, we certainly wouldn't decline any further '09, '08 based upon the results of the tender so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And then, just two questions for Rob. Rob again just given again the significant moves in the euro here even in the last couple of weeks, can you just again remind us how well you're hedged for next year, and if these recent moves have impacted you in any way. And then on the cash that you're sitting on, can you just give us a flavor of what's sort of in that cash bucket? Do you have any exposure there on what is cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. To your first question, as we look at the impact of currencies, I think as I've discussed with most of you in the past, the euro is one of the currencies where we do hedge, so we have largely hedged our position going into the remainder of this year and into next year for the euro. And also given the fact that the euro is one of our largest cost basis due to our manufacturing footprint within Europe and how we do global supply of our BioScience products, the euro frankly is not going to be the material driver of any FX concerns we have.</p>
          <p>Really if you look at it, the currencies that are the most impactful from the comment I made in the prepared remarks are really more coming from Latin America, we can't directly hedge those. I think that I've highlighted in the past we have historically benefited from a portfolio effect given the number of currencies we have margin in that as the currencies move at different &#x2013; in different degrees and different directions versus both the dollar and the euro they've created a muting effect so we don't really get major swings up or down. In the last couple of weeks we've seen a 20 to 30% move in those currencies, really retracing in &#x2013; since September 1 back to levels they were at back in 2005. So, that's what I wanted to signal, which is it's too early to say what that will do next year because obviously it depends on how all of the currencies move together. But given that is kind of historic move I did want to just highlight to people it's something we are watching, how it plays out next year, we'll have to see. But the current moves of the euro are not a concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash side we are very conservative in how we invest our cash. It's all sitting in either bank deposits or in money market accounts. We have no auction rate securities, no investments in sub-prime mortgages, no meaningful investments of any kind in any of the companies, the financial institutions that you've seen in the press. So, from that perspective we're in very good shape.</p>

          <p>David Lewis of Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. A couple things, I guess first off on guidance for the fourth quarter, Rob, when we think about the performance in the third quarter, when you sort of just transpose that onto the fourth quarter, it does appear that the 0.88 to $0.90 guidance reflects some conservatism. Are there other dynamics, either R&amp;D spend continuing at these higher levels or increasing SG&amp;A spend in the fourth quarter we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean we're not looking at an acceleration of any of our spend items. If you look at really what drove the third quarter performance, as I think I mentioned in the call, if you look at the roughly $0.06 of over performance versus The Street expectation, 0.02 of that is coming from the tax side. Roughly $0.02 of that is operational over-performance and about $0.02 of it is really a pull-forward of some of the sales we had originally expected. Especially on some high-margin products we thought we'd see in the fourth quarter. So, that's why really as you look at what we're guiding for the full year, we're still running ahead of where we expected to be on the full year, but there was a little bit of timing shift between the fourth and the third quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also just operationally, it sounds like GM is the most significant factor where you thought GM should be a little weaker in the third and obviously they weren't, so that's just a pull-forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And David that's the result of the better-than-expected recombinant sales in the quarter and that's also related to the shift that Rob is talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Can you touch &#x2013; you had signaled the second &#x2013; the back half of the year we'd see better plasma-derived factor VIII and you talked about specific timing. Could you just walk through the specific timing of those contracts for the specific countries that are involved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're talking about the plasma-derived and FEIBA tenders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically we're seeing a shift from last year compared to this year. So it's basically in Brazil and some of the ECEMEA [Eastern Central Europe Middle East Africa] markets where these tenders occur. So if we look at last year, David, we had about let's call it 20% of our tender orders come through in the third quarter. This year we had about 45% of the tenders come through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very helpful. And then I guess for Bob here a second, thinking about just the demand drivers for IVIG, clearly you talked about your MMN process moving forward, we had another competitor in the second quarter or I'm sorry the third quarter talk about a CIDP approval...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect competitive approvals for CIDP in your ongoing development efforts in MMN to result in any acceleration in demand for neuropathy broadly defined over the next six to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think generally whenever any of the competitors or players in the market get approval for a specific indication, it's generally a good thing for the market. You're referencing Talecris' approval for the CIDP indication. Obviously this is a priority for us going forward is &#x2013; as evidenced by the MMN project that I described. We continue to expand our label with approved indications and I think it's one of several reasons why we're very bullish on the long-term outlook in terms of the demand drivers for IVIG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, I'll hop in queue here, but R&amp;D obviously continues to be at sort of the higher end of ranges that we would expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Still be thinking about heading into next year and obviously Bob this is a strategic focus for the business, which is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thinking about a trend line for '09 that's going to keep R&amp;D in the high 6%, close to 7%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly are going to continue to invest in R&amp;D at a growth at a greater rate than revenue. You're right. It has been fairly dramatic toward the upper end over the last couple years. As we've commented frequently our improving financial position really has allowed us to not only generate great short-term results, but invest in the business for the long term. We're very pleased with how our pipeline continues to evolve. And frankly we look forward to next year when we have our investor conference probably providing a little bit more insight in terms of the pipeline and the benefit that we're deriving from the investment. But going forward again strategically, our commitment is to invest in R&amp;D at a faster rate than top-line growth. Just how much that will be is a function of a number of things, which obviously we'll comment on in more detail with our '09 guidance in January.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. A couple clarifications, first the &#x2013; on the anesthesia business. You've commented about the tough comparisons obviously in the U.S. as well as some wholesaler patterns. Should we assume anesthesia reaccelerates in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we do expect to see some acceleration in the U.S. in the fourth quarter as we will see some that wholesaler stocking reverse itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And should we think about on the BioSciences side of the business, you &#x2013; it's tough to keep track of some of these contracts and the different pieces of the business, but your BioSciences business was obviously very strong internationally this quarter in part because of the timing of some tenders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That historically would have got into the fourth quarter. So as we think about third quarter BioSciences growth versus fourth quarter BioSciences growth, that's principally the differential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, help people think a little bit about the impact of FX on the gross margin line going forward. Your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter might look a little bit conservative, but I want to hear how gross &#x2013; how FX plays into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mike this is Rob, I'll answer that. As we've talked about in the past, it's actually currencies as we've had a weakening dollar have actually had a slight drag on our gross margin. And by slight I mean, we're talking...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross margin...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On our gross margin percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe .2% or less, I mean it's very small. So it's not a meaningful drag and it won't be a meaningful benefit as the dollar strengthens would be my expectation. But it won't &#x2013; I would expect that if we do see the dollar continue to strengthen across the board, it should flip to be a slight benefit, again not meaningful enough in my mind to change any improved direction on the type of guidance we've been giving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just throw one other question out there I apologize. Bob, if you could comment are you seeing any change or any &#x2013; thinking across your business, across your various customers, are you seeing anything, as a result of the credit crisis in the economy, in your customer base? You have a unique set of customers where certainly in the U.S. market you wouldn't think you'd see much of it, but I'm curious if internationally if you're seeing anything at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're really not. I mean I think it speaks to one of the great strengths of our company, which is the nature of the businesses that we're in that we described as medically necessary products. We're not in OTC, vitamins and other kinds of discretionary categories within healthcare. Everything that we're in is the difference between life and death. So the underlying demand, Mike, whether it's U.S. or globally, continues to be there. We don't see any impact thus far, and frankly even projecting out in time. It's difficult for us to conceive of where there is going to be a major impact in terms of the underlying demand drivers. One might suggest internationally in certain markets, let's say some of the Latin American markets and so on that there may be fewer discretionary dollars that they can make available for tenders for certain products and so on. I think we have a long ways to go before we get to that point.</p>
          <p>I think the more practical impact on our business, whether it's U.S. or globally, really is and we closely monitor obviously our receivables, I think it's reasonable to conclude for all industries and all companies that it's &#x2013; given the credit situation and so on that people are going to take longer to pay their bills. I would tell you, we haven't seen that manifest itself thus far. In fact, we had great results in Q3 as Rob indicated on our DSO. But I think we need to be open minded to the fact that that's likely going to happen and we're very vigilant in monitoring that. But in some ways, that's more tactical than the question you're asking, which is the core underlying drivers of our business. And we want to be objective about it. We don't want to stick our head in the sand. But I do think it's fair to say that given the nature of our products we really don't think certainly for the foreseeable future that there is going to be any dilution in the underlying demand drivers for our businesses.</p>

          <p>Those countries have tended to be, if you look in absolute dollars of margin for us depending on the country, around 90 to $100 million of margin in each of those countries.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's terrific. And we were a little surprised when we talked to J&amp;J on the quarterly call about the extent to which currency-driven changes in margin would actually flow down to the margin line, excuse me. They were saying two-thirds or so. Is your exposure in those territories...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, nowhere even near that. I think as we have indicated in the past, really up until this most recent move in the market we were confident that we were going to see really no meaningful impact at all. It's still too early, as I highlighted in my comments and in the question earlier, to say what it will be. But in &#x2013; under no scenario is it anything to that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, a third or less, is that fair?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's terrific. And, could you comment just on the dynamics within the plasma protein segment this quarter, what was strong, what was &#x2013; well it looked all pretty good, but any particular standouts in that category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Bruce, to your point, everything really did quite well. As I commented, we're seeing great growth in all of the categories. As we highlighted, we saw some plasma drive factor VIII tenders, which drove that. FEIBA has continued to do well. Recombinant did exceedingly well in the third quarter and our plasma business continued to show very good growth. So, I really &#x2013; I would just say, really we were quite pleased with how all of those businesses are performing. One doesn't necessarily standout versus any of the others.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce, it's Mary Kay. I'd just add that across the board on the plasma proteins, almost every product grew more than 20% in the quarter. Now, I would caution some of that was due to the timing of some of these FEIBA and PD factor VIII tenders. So, that growth will not continue into the fourth quarter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. Clearly R&amp;D spending is rising and given the &#x2013; I guess ending of the CLEARSHOT program, I don't know whether CLEARSHOT was part of the wildcard pipeline. I don't recall, but maybe you could help us &#x2013; point us to some things we're going to see coming out of the pipeline or the wildcard pipeline? Anything happening over the next six, 12 months incremental that we should be focused on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me comment specifically on CLEARSHOT and then &#x2013; first of all, no, CLEARSHOT was never on the wildcard list. It was on a different list, I'm not sure what we'd call it. No, this is a program that was implemented I think going back seven, eight years in time, interesting technology. At the end of the day, the product features and the ability to differentiate and price the product was never going to offset or cover the incremental manufacturing cost. And, this is one of those where I think there was some missed calls from the start and I think we had the discipline to say, we're pulling the plug on it. But, I will tell you this was a program that was never dialed in our long range outlook in terms of upside in any material way. So, that's specifically CLEARSHOT.</p>
          <p>On the other "wildcard" programs, whether it's the flu vaccine or the cell therapy program or the new indications for GAMMAGARD and so on, I think generally those all are very much still in play. I don't really want to get into any details and comment on any of those specific programs today like I said earlier in response to &#x2013; I don't know if it was to Larry or David's question. We will get into that in more detail on our investor conference next year. So, suffice it to say we're pleased with how our new product pipeline continues to evolve, become more robust. I think all the &#x2013; virtually all the wildcards anyway that we showed you a year or so ago continue to be in play and represent upsides out in time and by that I mean even beyond our five-year financial LRP. [long range plan]. So beyond that unless you have a specific question, I'll just kind of stop there Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a couple more. Rob, you talked about the two about the 2009 headwinds and that we should expect that you'd perform at a minimum in line with your longer-term goals. I just want to make sure I understood what that meant, 11 to 13% of this range you've offered is for the full '08 year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, at a minimum, but in that range. Turning to COLLEAGUE, I hate to ask you always about this Bob, but maybe you could just update us in little more detail, are we likely to see more of these quarterly write-offs, reserves, adjustments, maybe you can update us on some of the regulatory milestones we could expect in...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer to your first question is, we certainly hope not and we certainly don't plan on it. But, obviously it's been difficult to predict the kind of the circuitous route of the efforts to remediate and then re-launch the product. Let me just comment on several things. The remediation of the singles continues in the US. I would tell you things are going very well outside the U.S. with both the singles and the triples. The area of focus as you know is to get to a point where we can resubmit a 510(k) on the triples. We talked going back in time about this buffer overload issue and through the process of fixing that there were, as we commented previously, several other what I'll just call low-level issues that we wanted to make sure we were comprehensive in addressing.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to work through that, we're in open dialogue with the agency on multiple aspects of this, including some type of what I'll just say "clinical study" on the triples before we re-launch or re-commercialize the product. I think it's in everyone's interest, first and foremost our customers, but certainly the agency's and ours to make sure that when we re-launch the next time, there are no mistakes made. Therefore, as I say, we continue to have dialogue with the agency relative to some type of clinical trial that we do before we re-launch. And, I think one of the questions there is do we do that before we formally submit the 510(k)? Do we formally submit the 510(k) have the agency hold that until we complete this, again clinical trial that I'm talking about. And frankly, we don't have all the pieces nailed down on that yet.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of financial impact, I mean clearly we're not going to be recommercializing the product this year. We will by the end of the year generate about $30 million in revenues associated with the remediated devices in the U.S. and also roughly about $30 million in normal revenue O.U.S., [outside U.S.] so about $60 million in sales for COLLEAGUE this year.</p>
          <p>The final point I would make and then I'll stop if you have any specific follow-ups Rick is that, since we spoke on this subject last quarter, we've actually experienced hardly any erosion of our install base in the U.S. So, I think that's good news in a number of ways, but again I think it just reinforces our need to be disciplined and thorough and working hand-in-hand with the agency. So, when we get to the point where we do recommercialize, we experience no surprises going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. Just one follow-up on that. Does a possible clinical trial make it likelier that COLLEAGUE returning is a 2010 event or no it's still...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's premature to estimate and obviously we'll be more definitive in the call in January. But, no, you should not conclude that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one last quick one. Rob, the fourth quarter tax rate, maybe you can help us make sure the impact of the R&amp;D tax credit catch up, I assume that's got to have a beneficial, essentially beneficial effect there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a little &#x2013; to a full year rate it's about a half of a point.  It's &#x2013; as I said it's about one penny, based on what we expect it to be at the moment to the fourth quarter and that's about half of a point on the full year tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Ben Andrew of William Blair is on line with a question. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just wanted to touch base briefly on Medicaid funding. And Bob, have you seen any proposals or kind of concerns about directional pressure like we saw whatever it was six or seven years ago with attempts to cut reimbursement for PD factor VIII as well as recombinant factor VIII?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't. I mean &#x2013; Ben I guess I would say this, there continues to be what I'd characterize as ongoing rather evolutionary pressures on reimbursement largely on a state by state basis, which is really a bigger issue as you know than any kind of Medicare reimbursement or anything of that nature. So, no, we really haven't seen any new events that would suggest to us that that rate is going to accelerate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and a follow up on COLLEAGUE. You commented that you haven't seen any erosion of the product in recent months. At what point do we reach a tipping point here? I mean in terms of next generation wireless systems, the sort of things that hospitals really want to be implementing in their hospitals, is there an issue relative to the continued delays here in terms of starting to see some of the larger buying groups switching over to the companies that have been able to start introducing those new generation systems. When do you have a wireless product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't know what the date is in terms of the tipping point. I suppose in theory there is some date, I don't see that as imminent that's for sure. We continue concurrently with the development of the next generation platform that incorporates a number of the features &#x2013; functionality capabilities that you've described. We look forward to being able to bring a product to the market that's responsive to that.</p>
          <p>I will say there is a practical issue that I think everybody is dealing with right now, which is whether it's the ability to buy an older version pump like COLLEAGUE or move to next generation technology offered by someone else or us. Hospitals aren't exactly flush with their capital budgets right now, their world is much different today than it was even 30 days ago. There is a lot of reasons why we haven't experienced erosion in our base I think. But, one of them as a practical matter is these are major capital investments for hospitals to convert wholesale, their IV pumps and while this next generation technology that you refer to is intriguing, and will be adopted someday in the U.S. As a practical matter, most hospitals in the U.S. are dealing with more pressing issues right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, that gets back to Mike's question though about seeing the underlying pressure in the hospitals, whether it's slowdown in procedure growth, which is evident in some hospitals or whether it's impact on capital programs, doesn't that have the risk of building into something more concerning over the next couple of years if this continues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I don't think, in terms of our business portfolio Ben, it's fundamental. People will not use fewer IV solutions because of the macroeconomic environment. There may be certain elective procedures, but they tend not to be those that are intensive in terms of the utilization of the kind of the products or businesses that we're in. So, again we watch this very closely. We don't want to be oblivious to the potential impact and I think we watch it very closely. But, well the comment that I made earlier in response to your earlier question, I guess I feel fairly strongly about.</p>
