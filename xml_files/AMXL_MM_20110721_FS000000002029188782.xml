          <p>Good morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone for the America Movil Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Michel Morin. Mr. Morin, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nateda. Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I'd like to welcome everyone to America Movil's second quarter results call. Today on the line with us, we have Daniel Hajj, the CEO; Carlos Garcia Moreno, CFO; Oscar Von Hauske, the Wireline COO; and Daniela Lecuona, Investor Relations Officer. So without further ado, let me turn it over to Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michel. Thank you. Welcome everybody. Carlos is going to make the summary of the second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning everyone. Thank you Michel for hosting the call. Well, we added in the second quarter &#x2013; America Movil added 5.1 million wireless subscribers. That was approximately half of the 10.5 million we gained in the first half of the year. In June, we took on a 36 million wireless subs.</p>
          <p>On the fixed line side, we increased by 1.4 million our revenue generating units to 54 million with pay TV subs growing 34% year-on-year. Altogether, we had 290 million accesses at the end of June, 12.1% more than a year before.</p>
          <p>The growth of fixed line accesses has accelerated on the back of bundled offerings, double-play and triple-play that are becoming increasingly popular. Year-on-year, fixed line accesses increased nearly 14%.</p>
          <p>Revenue grew 7.8% from the year earlier quarter to 150 billion pesos. Mobile revenue expanded 9.4% to 101 billion pesos whereas fixed line revenues increased 5.2% to 58 billion pesos swept along by PayTV revenues that expanded 71% year-on-year. So, total revenues then accelerated from a bit more than 6% the prior year quarter to 7.8% this quarter.</p>
          <p>Mobile revenues were driven by data revenues that increased 26.7%. Their overall expansion already reflects the impact of the 71% effective reduction in mobile termination rates that took place in Mexico. From May 17th, all operators that terminate a call &#x2013; on the Cofetel cell network, are billed the interconnection charges at the reduced termination rate set by Cofetel, which are equivalent to 2.2 dollar-cents or 1.65 euro-cents. In example, including Mexico and three European countries, this interconnection rate was the second lowest despite the fact that penetration rates are substantially higher in Europe.</p>
          <p>Telcel's net interconnection revenues came down by almost 4 percentage points of service revenues from the prior year. Gross interconnection revenues came down by 50.2% in absolute terms and by 5.1 percentage points of service revenues. Several of our operations registered double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, revenue growth was more subdued, in euros 2% because of the continued decline of fixed line voice revenues and the reduction in mobile and fixed line termination rates in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Brazil annual revenue growth accelerated from 5.7% in the first quarter to 8.8% in the second quarter. EBITDA totaled 62 billion pesos and was up 1.8% year-on-year, with the margin of our Mexican operations falling 3.4% percentage points on account of the loss of net interconnection revenues in Mexico on the wireless platform. Greater expenses for customer care, the procurement of content, and subscriber growth basically subscriber acquisition cost.</p>
          <p>Various operations, particularly in South America posted better EBITDA margins than the prior year. Financing costs declined 42% year-on-year and contributed to the 14% increase in net profit. Earnings per share were up 16% in peso terms and 34% per ADR. Our net debt rose to 217 billion pesos in June from 207 in December to help fund 37 billion pesos in capital outlays and dividends. Capital expenditures made up 41 billion pesos of that amount, and share buyback nearly 30 billion pesos with 2 billion pesos going to the acquisition of minority interest in Net Servi&#xE7;os and Telint International. Net debt stood at 0.87 times our EBITDA of the 12 months.</p>
          <p>So with this summary, Michel I would like to pass the floor back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, while we poll for questions, Carlos if I can jump in and ask the first question. Regarding the termination rates in Mexico, the new rates went into effect on May 17th. So I just want to confirm, perhaps to state the obvious, but the impact on results that we saw this quarter was really only impacting in the second half of the quarter. So if we were to look at ARPU trends on a sequential basis, is it fair to say that we should anticipate a similar impact in the third quarter when the rates will be at the lower level for the entire quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michel. We are just &#x2013; the interconnection rates which we reduce that through May 16, so it was exactly half of the second quarter. So you are going to see the same trends in the third quarter. Of course it's going to depend a lot on the traffic, but I think we are going to see the same trends in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there any signs that these lower rates are being passed on to &#x2013; to the final customers, and if so, maybe it's still too early, but are there any early signs that demand is picking up in relation to the elasticity that we might be able to see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is going to be a lot of elasticity, because we have been reducing the rates every year. So we're not seeing a big elasticity there, but I don't &#x2013; I don't know exactly what those, the big lines are going to do. I think they are still not reducing the rates to the end customer. But I'm sure that they are going to do that in the near future.</p>
          <p>So I don't know if they are going to do it in the third quarter, in the second quarter, in the fourth quarter or they're going to do it totally or they're going to reduce a little bit less or a little bit more, I don't know, because there is a lot of competition in the &#x2013; in the peaks in Mexico and that is there decision, but I'm sure that they are going to &#x2013; at the end of the day, we're going to see reductions to the customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much. Nateda, we can open it up to the Q&amp;A roster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir, and your next question &#x2013; I'm sorry your first question is from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Following up on the mobile termination rates, I think didn't Cofetel make it retroactive to January 1st, and is there any possibility you might have to retroactively reduce rates? And then maybe if you could update us as far as what you're seeing as far as mobile termination rate changes in Brazil, as far as the timing, magnitude or what it might mean to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a contract with some of the operators Telmex, Telef&#xF3;nica &#x2013; Telmex, Telef&#xF3;nica has a contract, so that's why we are putting these interconnection rates through May 16th, they are the ones, all the others operators, we don't have a contract, they don't sign a contract since January. So we have retroactive through January, but we have been put that in the first quarter, so the operators where we don't have any contract, we have been putting the interconnection through January and but that's the &#x2013; we already provision that in the first quarter, but that's mainly 10% or 15% of everything. So 85% was in the contract and it's starting May 16th.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, well in Brazil the interconnection rate is &#x2013; I think it's going to move, but I think that the government is going to, I don't know exactly what they are going to decide, but I don't think they're going to make a 70% or 71% reduction on interconnection. I think what they are thinking to do is to have a reduction through the years, and that will help to increase penetration in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So that's my view, that's what the government has been saying. Maybe they are not going to reduce 10% per year, maybe they're going to reduce 20% per year. But that's the way I think they're going to do it.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My question is on the competitive environment in Mexico, and it seems that you have been unveiling some new plans, bucket plans that include calls outgoing to other mobile carriers as well, and I was wondering how you see this changing the competitive environment, and how this fits in with the new reality, with the mobile termination rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there is a new plans, there is new plans not from us, from all the operators. So there is a lot of competition in Mexico. And I don't see any big change with all these bucket plans to all customers, I don't think you're going to see big changes in the way customers are calling on the &#x2013; or the way they decide their call. So in my view, there is not going to be a big change in demand or in ARPU because of these new bucket plans that we're having.</p>
          <p>The only difference is that, we're not differentiating the Telcel to Telcel and Telcel to other customers. So that's also what other operators are doing here in Mexico, and I don't think there is an issue or a big difference that you're going to see there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And just my follow-up would be, I mean in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, it's only to explain to you, we have that in Colombia. In Colombia, the government asked us to reduce the difference between on net and off net and we have been doing that for maybe two years, and we haven't seen any big change in that. So, that's why I am thinking that you are not going to see big changes also in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And do you think that possibly you will be asked by the regulator to do the same thing in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know, it may be yes, we are doing that, so if the regulator asks us to do that, well, we are doing that already. So, but I don't think that's going to be something that we'll &#x2013; that we will be worried about in Telcel now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have good customers, we have in postpaid. We have good coverage, we have &#x2013; I think the fundamentals are very important for us in Mexico. We have a very good distribution network, we have very good coverage. We have a lot of capacity, we're investing a lot, so we have a good branding. So we're matching the market with customer care centers, we have around 300 customers own care centers. So all of these things are the things that really count in Mexico. We have been doing that for around 12 years. So I think we have the big and the good fundamentals in Mexico in place.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just wondered if you could talk about data trends. I guess probably more specifically in Mexico and Brazil. Are you seeing cheaper handsets come to the market in the smartphone side that you think might help increase overall data ARPUs, and just talk about some of the trends you're seeing there as they shift from text messaging to more Internet type data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be very important for Latin America to have cheaper handsets. The cheaper smartphone handsets, I think everybody is going to use at the end of the day, Internet and they're going to use data. So we start maybe two years ago with $500 handsets, we have today $200 handsets with a very good software included, they are Apple, or Android or BlackBerry or &#x2013; but we have much better handsets today, and that's going to make customers to use more data in the future.</p>
          <p>All the trends in Latin America you could see that we're growing around more than 25% in data, and I think all the investments to do that you need to have a backhaul, backbone and a lot of investments that you need to do, and that's what we are investing and that's what we're doing. So I think, we expect good increase in data usage in the future in Latin America. We still have a very small amount of customers with smartphone, so as the smartphones go reduce the price, we have better prices in the smartphones, then you're going to see more customers with the smartphones and more customers using data.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you. Two quick questions for you. First of all just to follow up on all of the questions regarding the regulatory environment in Mexico, we noticed an interview last week where the head of Cofetel was talking about the possibility of perhaps implementing price floors for Telcel to try to manage the market share that you guys have there a little bit. I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that and whether you've had any formal conversations with the regulators on that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on Brazil, I just was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the subscriber trends that you're seeing there. We noticed that minutes of use as well as ARPUs were &#x2013; have now fallen about 10% or so both year-over-year with the churn ticking up little bit. Just was wondering if that was more of a competitive pressure that you're seeing or whether you're seeing any signs of more kind of macro pressures beginning to weigh on the Brazilian consumer a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Mexico I don't see those that &#x2013; what the President of Cofetel &#x2013; the interview of the President of Cofetel. What I can tell you in Mexico is that, my market share is across all the investments that we are doing, all the distribution. I think we have a lot of rural areas where the only operator is Telcel. So I don't think that the regulator is going to put us a floor in place.</p>
          <p>So I think what the regulators are trying to do is to have a benefit for the customers, a benefit for the competitors. And if we are going to benefit the customers with good coverage, good quality, good data, I don't think they should put like a floor in prices. What they're doing is, they're hurting the customer, and I don't see any place in the world where they want to hurt the customer. And the other thing is, let's see what all the competitors are doing, no? Because I don't think they can do in two days what we have been doing in 10 years, no?</p>
          <p>So it's going to be interesting, I'm going to read that interview to understand what he's talking about, no? I mean, in Brazil, well, I think well Carlos can talk a little in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned in the &#x2013; at the beginning of the call, revenues in Brazil have accelerated from 5.7% in the first quarter to 8.8% in the second quarter. And for us, we're not looking very much at this revenue. Remember that this is net of commissions paid to distributors. That's the way how we have been booking our revenues.</p>
          <p>And so even after developing the commissions or the growth of &#x2013; or paid to distributors which have been much more calculated given that we are growing a lot on postpaid. And postpaid obviously requires the payment of sales commissions and generally some subscriber acquisition cost. In spite of that I think that we are seeing very healthy revenue growth. I think both on the mobile and the fixed line side.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Tom&#xE1;s Lajous with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Thank you very much for the call. I guess the question is the nano, Carlos, you've talked in the past about keeping the Mexico margin above 50%. We're seeing it getting very close to 50%. Would you &#x2013; would you still &#x2013; is your outlook still for an above 50% margin in Mexico? And that will be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is a bit more general. We're seeing a little bit of growth come back, Carlos, you mentioned it in the case of Brazil. Overall we're seeing an acceleration of revenue growth over the past few quarters. Would you say that you're comfortable sacrificing margins a little bit for more growth, or are you going to get back towards a real cost control phase and trying to keep the margins up? What's going to be the focus, growth or margins over the next few quarters, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, when we talk about the 50% margin in Mexico, I think we are more or less in the 50% margin. In Mexico, we don't think that the regulator was going to reduce the termination rate 70% &#x2013; 70 something percent in one day. You know I think that's bad for the telecommunications in Mexico, not for us only. It's going to hurt all the telecommunications &#x2013; all the telecom operators in Mexico.</p>
          <p>I think that there is still a lot of investment that you need to do in Mexico, and I think for the penetration, it's not so good, because then there is a lot of people that they only think that they do is receiving calls in the rural area. So that's very bad for them, because and I don't think that's going to be a good business for the operators to invest in the rural areas when the interconnection rate goes down from 80 something peso &#x2013; 0.85 pesos to maybe 0.28 pesos because of the billing change between minutes and seconds, okay? So it's around 70 something percent reduction. I'm still thinking to be very close to the 50% margin; I hope we can be above the 50% margin.</p>
          <p>But going to your second question, I think we're going to privilege more the growth than the EBITDA, but we're going to be very careful on the EBITDA, as we have been always careful on the EBITDA. But I think, what we need to do is to take advantage of the growth in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So we cannot stop growing only- let's say in Brazil only to have better EBITDA, no, I think the next two years in Brazil are going to be excellent years for growth on still on wireless, on data, on TV, on broadband. So there is a lot of markets where you're going to see very good growth in the next years, and I think what we're going to do is to go for it, no? So in an intelligent way, the way we've been doing it for the last year, but I think it's very important to still be very &#x2013; that's why we're doing all the investments that we're doing, all the CapEx is to sustain all these big growth on data that it's going to come.</p>
          <p>And we're growing a lot also on postpaid subscribers. You could see that in every country our postpaid subscribers have been growing a lot. So we are being very focused on our strategy, and that's what we're going to maintain.</p>

          <p>That's something that we have to ask to the regulators. I don't think they are going to reduce the interconnection and then increase the interconnection, so it doesn't look, it doesn't make sense for me that they reduced 70 something percent, and then they increase it. What I can see is that I hope that there is not going to be any more reductions on interconnection rates in the future though for some years.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Hi, this is Sean Glickenhaus, actually, calling for Richard. Just a little more detail on the Brazil data. It looks like data revenue in Brazil, though they were up 16.5%, it does look like they decelerated quite a bit from the prior quarter, especially if you look at these numbers compared to competitors. Is there some type of plan to revitalize this? You obviously sound very positive or optimistic on that segment, but is there anything in particular other than increasing focus on postpaid subs as you've been doing, anything that you're doing to revitalize data in Brazil? And then I have one question on your guidance. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on data what we need to do is to put more coverage in other cities to try to sell more the PC cards and the broadband, wireless broadband. It's what we're doing. It's part of our investments in Brazil is to do, let's say Fiber-to-the-Node where you can do a lot more data in the wireless broadband. So we are being focusing on that. There is a time to do the investments, but of course we are really interested in giving more data to the customers, our own customers that have the smartphones, to get new customers with the smartphones plus data and the PC cards, the broadband wireless access.</p>
          <p>So we are being focused on that. We have to do the investments. I think Brazil is huge, is big and the investments took a little bit of time, but we are focusing on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's actually very helpful. Thank you. Just one question on your guidance that you offered at the Investor Day of 7% to 9% EBITDA, five year CAGR, knowing what you do now in terms of the interconnect rate in Mexico, is that 7% to 9% growth kind of on the aggressive side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it's too early to say. I think that if you look at revenue growth, we are right on track. On the guidance that we mentioned, certainly on the &#x2013; in the short-term we have had some unexpected impacts on the &#x2013; on EBITDA. But I think that some of them may be reverted.</p>
          <p>For instance, if you look at fixed line revenues in Mexico, that has been declining fast, they seem to be &#x2013; this decline seems to be becoming less important. I think that we &#x2013; if they were falling at about 5% rate in the first quarter, by the second quarter it's only about 3.5% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>So to the extent that they stabilize, that could have a fairly immediate impact on EBITDA, because that have been an important driver of EBITDA growth for America Movil as a whole. So I think that, if we look at some of the things like again the overall situation of the fixed line operations in Mexico and Central America, if you look &#x2013; if we look at the effect of net interconnection rates not being much bigger than the growth that it has been in the second quarter, if that's the case, I think that we can still hit our EBITDA target.</p>
          <p>We mentioned here in the &#x2013; at the beginning of the call &#x2013; there's several operations that are expanding margin &#x2013; the margins, the EBITDA margins today. Okay. And there is some of them because EBITDA margins have been a bit more subdued, because we have seen an acceleration of subscriber growth.</p>
          <p>So again, I think that for the timeframe that we looked at, which was basically four years, it is too early to say that the numbers that we saw at the Investor Day are not valid. I think that we are delivering revenue growth and I think that EBITDA growth should follow. We're delivering revenue growth, we're delivering subscriber growth and we think EBITDA growth will follow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more thing on the interconnection rate in Mexico. I think we are applying that rate, but it is under protest. We are appealing that and we're going to fight that in court. So I'm not saying that we're going to win, but that we're going to fight and we're going to see what will the court decide on that. So we are being very conservative, putting all the interconnection in the results. But all these interconnections is under protest and we are going to appeal that in the court.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a couple of quick ones. Not to keep focusing on the NTR in Mexico, but can you just tell us how much of this sequential decline in Mexican ARPU was related to the termination rate reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; not to look at the &#x2013; if you were to look at Telcel, the interconnection revenues as I mentioned before year-on-year, fell by 50.2%. The non-interconnection revenues increased by 7%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have some on the growth, the growth has been hit a little bit. And the growth's more on the postpaid side on better handsets, so it's a little bit more softness on that. So that's hit us as well. So it's a &#x2013; on the &#x2013; on that but a &#x2013; the &#x2013; mostly it's going to be on the interconnection on what Carlos is saying, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just switching topics, margins in Brazil were down just a little bit sequentially. Can you talk about the main drivers there and how should we think about Brazil margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; just Carlos is going to answer that, but just to say, I think the core EDITDA in Brazil in Claro in the wireless side increased a little bit. So you could see that almost all of that is because of the acquisition cost. So big part in Claro is acquisition cost, so the big growth that we are having, the big growth on postpaid that we are having also, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; that means everything that we have, soon I think it's a &#x2013; acquisition cost is important. We are spending more on customer care, so we have more call centers. And then while we have continued to see the increase in the procurement of content, which is something that we have already mentioned in prior quarters.</p>
          <p>We have 255% more net adds in postpaid than what we have last year. So I think a big part of that is acquisition cost, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more thing about &#x2013; on the cost, what &#x2013; on what Carlos is saying is, we are investing a lot. We had a very good strategy on the customer care center. So it has changed a little bit from what the way we &#x2013; we attend person two years ago and what we have to do it today, and what we're going to do it in the future, why because, we used to sell a lot of postpaid voice. And when you sell a lot of postpaid voice, it's easy because then you sell the handset, they start to talk and it's very easy for a person to understand that.</p>
          <p>But when you start to sell data, handset and smartphone, it's really different. You have to explain how to do the e-mail. It's different how to do data. It's different how to run Internet, how to download these things. So our customer cares contacts spend a lot more time with the customers until they learn. I think that's going to be a curve until all the customers in Mexico learn how to do those type of things.</p>
          <p>So that's why we are investing more. I think that's a big value for us to have a good customer care centers by person &#x2013; to do it through personalize or do it through telephone or the other thing that we're doing it a lot through Internet. So we are investing a lot. We are moving and we have a good strategy for the next two to three years in the &#x2013; in the contact centers, no?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of questions on the growth in your PayTV business, especially the 800,000 net adds that you had this quarter. First, do you think that you can get to 20 million PayTV subscribers faster than 2013? I mean do you think that you're growing faster than the market as a whole?</p>
          <p>And then second, with respect to the EBITDA margins, Brazil was the exception, but in Peru, in Colombia and Chile, your EBITDA margin expansion corresponded to the acceleration in the non-wireless business. So I'm just wondering whether America Movil's marginal profitability is actually increasing in the PayTV business as you leverage your scale in programming and set-top box procurement.</p>
          <p>And then last, should I think of this as the PayTV business as a whole as an offset to the decline in your fixed voice revenues? That wasn't the case in Central America, but how should I think about sizing the opportunity in this product set for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar can talk a little bit about the TV business now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, we have a run rate of growth in PayTV business around 200,000 per month. So that's the expectation that we see. Of course we could get a grant to deliver video in Mexico we could expand more the business. And your assumption about expansion of the margins in the other countries, I think something comes from the synergies between America Movil and the wireline business, that allow us to grow more in the revenue generating units.</p>
          <p>And to aggregate all the volumes, we are getting better costs as you mentioned in the set-top boxes and as well in the content and the cost of the content. In the case of Brazil, we are growing very, very fast in net and via Embratel, so the cost of the content is growing more than 100% and of course as well the revenues. But, we have a lot of costs of &#x2013; customer acquisitions to enable distribution to the installation of the services and &#x2013; but we expect the PayTV business growing pretty fast. If you see the case of Brazil, PayTV penetration is in our view is still very low, is around 18% of the households. When you compare with other countries like Argentina or even Mexico, in Argentina is 62% and in Mexico is 35%. So we could expect a good market position to grow in Brazil. I don't know, if you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more thing that I want to add is that one of the big parts of the cost in the TV is content, okay? And as we grow in content, we're going to be allowed to have a better cost on that. So a big part &#x2013; a big increase &#x2013; a big share of the increase in Brazil is because the fast-growing PayTV business that we're having there. But also the cost has been growing a lot. So when you target some amount of customers and every day you have more and more customers, I think it's going to be more easy for us to get better prices in the content. I think the volume is going to be very important in the future. So I think we need to work very hard to try to reduce the cost of the content. So I think it's something that we are being working on that, no?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Daniel. Does that breakpoint in terms of profitability with respect to your ability to source content, does that come when the business scales to 15 million or to 20 million? And I'm just thinking about, I know you don't think of your business this way, you think on a more integrated basis. But when I look at the growth in your PayTV business Daniel, its look to me as though it's the equivalent of actually opening up a new country in terms of the traditional wireless business. Is that the right way that I should think about the growth opportunity both in terms of revenue and EBITDA for America Movil in this product set?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think PayTV is going to be an excellent business I think we have a good opportunity to grow there still penetration, as Oscar is saying, penetration in Latin America for the PayTV business is low. I think we still have a lot to do and I don't think that we're going to see $50 million or $20 million I think what you're going to see is every day that you grow maybe you reach a little bit more scale and when you reach more scale then you could have better cost. In the other side, in the set-top boxes and in all of those type of different devices I think we're having much better prices, so every day I think we are making the TV business more and more profitable but of course it's not the same to do a fixed call or a long distance call then to have a pay TV business. No, in the other side you have to spent lots of money on content but every day I think it's getting better and better the profitability.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Daniel just a quick question. It doesn't look like from your net adds in Mexico that not advertising on television has been an issue. So just wondering how you are thinking about it right now after a few months without doing advertisement on TV?</p>
          <p>And second question is on TracFone, we noticed a slowdown in net adds, in net additions in the second quarter both if you compare with the second quarter, both if you compare with the second quarter 2010 and then if you compare with the first quarter 2011. Just wondering if you think that the niche that this very high growth rates or net additions that we've been seeing in the last many, many quarters has come to slowdown and we're going to continue to see like that or you &#x2013; it was just a one-off slowdown?

So it has been &#x2013; some sponsorships, so it has been good for us there. We have been doing well still we're &#x2013; tat the brand has been very good top of mind. So I think we are not &#x2013; let's say suffering about that. We are doing in other broadcast television with a network. So we are targeting and it has been working good for us. So we are using a lot of internal media, so we are happy the way things are being developed in that &#x2013; in that issue. So in the TracFone...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On TracFone, Mauricio, you may recall, typically the second quarter is always a weak quarter because that's in the U.S. when people have to pay taxes and it has always been very sensitive. So practically every second quarter, as far as I can remember, has tended to be weaker. Probably last year it wasn't the case because we had just launched Straight Talk, the new plan. And also the new plan was getting a lot of new adds and there was really no churn in that plan yet. I think what we are seeing in this second quarter is partly, seasonality, partly the beginning of the churn or the effect of some churn numbers on some of the &#x2013; which would be natural on some of the base that we already have. But that's nothing unusual, nothing that was outside of our expectations.</p>

          <p>The total net additions, I think we have been higher than the budget, which has been doing I think more than 10 million subscribers this year. So we said that we're going to have 16, so we're going to be higher than what we expect this year. Some of the people is saying that we have been &#x2013; I think Latin America has been very strong in their economy or being strong in the economies and that will help us a little bit on the growth on the subscribers, mostly on postpaid. Postpaid has been running very good for us. So I'm happy. And the second question you said, ARPUs on what?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mexico. What I can tell you is that we just saw &#x2013; we have only had an effect of interconnection rate in second quarter, or part of the quarter since May 17th. So a part of that is going to carry on until the third quarter. I think it's important to understand that the relationship that we used to have between ARPU and EBITDA does not longer hold because where you are going to have less revenues by interconnection that's not the percentage of the net impact on Telcel. Remember, Telcel has interconnection revenue, but it also has interconnection cost. So one has to focus on the net effect at the level of Telcel, and then furthermore at the level of Mexico as a whole, Mexico consolidated.</p>
          <p>So you will continue to see declines in gross interconnection revenue, and we have some impact on net terms potentially on the types of traffic that we will see. I think it is important to highlight that the relationship that you have had up until now between ARPU and EBITDA is going to be different from here now on.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions, please, one on &#x2013; in Chile churn rates went up a lot this quarter, and I was wondering, first, the reasons for that and what is strategy into this specifically.</p>
          <p>And second one would be on Brazil; postpaid net adds were quite strong &#x2013; have been quite strong over the past quarters and once again this quarter. But this quarter specifically, MOUs came down in Brazil by four minutes. And my question is &#x2013; I mean, I was expecting the MOUs to have gone up, given how strong postpaid net additions were. So what should we expect in terms of usage and ARPUs consequently in the next quarters given how strong postpaid net adds are? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is in Chile, churn rates went up a lot and so my question is why...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, in Chile &#x2013; let me talk a little bit about Chile. I think in Chile we have been doing very good in terms of gross adds. We have been having some promotions that haven't worked so well, so we have been very close in that market and that some of the customers have become churned. But I think in Chile we are gaining market share, we are being strong in the distribution side, strong in the &#x2013; much better in the postpaid. I think in the postpaid we are doing much better than what we used to do last year.</p>
          <p>So we have a big increase in Chile, still we need to work a little bit in some promotions because some of those promoters are giving us some churn, but we are aware of that, and we're working on that. It's not going to be from one quarter to the other one, but we think that we can return to the level of churn that we have all around Latin America. Now that's something that we have been working on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of Brazil MOUs, I think they are directly linked to some prepaid promotions. And basically we introduced a new promotion that essentially encourages more the actual continuous purchase of airtime as opposed to holding big balances of minutes that you can consume and it has had a good effect both on revenues, and it's not had such an impact on profit. So that's basically the transition from &#x2013; one type of promotions on prepaid to another type of promotions.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Andr&#xE9;s Medina Mora with GBM.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, Carlos and Daniel. My question is regarding postpaid subscribers. What percentage of your subscriber base do you see these &#x2013; do you see them reaching by the end of 2012 or 2011?</p>
          <p>And also we heard Telmex mentioned yesterday that they are investing a lot of &#x2013; in fiber to the node. How much synergies of that could Telcel make given that they are separate companies between them? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to do a lot of synergies. We work as a separate company, but we can do a lot of synergies in the backbone, in the backhaul, in fiber to the node. I think that we are working on that. We have 60% of the company, but we're working very close to them, but we are selling as commercial agreements that allow us to do those types of things, no? So that's mainly what we're doing. The other question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Proporci&#xF3;n de pospago? [Proportion of postpaid?]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know exactly what's going to be at the end subscriber base in 2012, but what &#x2013; you could see the same trends that we have been having the first six months. I think it's more or less what we could &#x2013; you could see the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think increasingly, one thing that we have always said is that increasingly postpaid market is going to be about data services. And I think that we have been strengthening our capabilities on data across all of our operations. As Daniel mentioned before, we are working on backhaul, working on backbones, we are really buying the latest equipment. We are having very, very good practice for smartphones. So I think that we are positioning ourselves very well in the data services market and that is going to be a critical element for postpaid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also one comment on that. I think to do data service is not only to say, is you have to have good handsets, you have to have good value added services, you have to have a very good network, you have to have very good coverage. So you have to work in a lot of things to have a good increase in data, and that's what we are doing all around Latin America. So it's not only to have an smartphone and sell the smartphone. It's much more than that. It's the investments on those things.</p>
          <p>Also, as we are saying, in customer care center. So you have to do a lot of things all around to have more postpaid, for those postpaid to work with data and work with a lot of value-added services that we're selling all around Latin America. So there is a big job, there is a huge strategy that you have to execute, and that's what we are doing at &#x2013; right now.</p>

          <p>Well, Michel, I think the last question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Nateda, is there another question in the queue?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There is a question from the line of Walter Piecyk with BTIG.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Carlos, I didn't really understand that explanation on the Brazil MOUs, but I'll follow up with Daniel online. But I guess, if you have prepaid promotions, I'm not sure how that drives your minutes down. Wouldn't that do the opposite? Anyway, the question is, are you guys &#x2013; for Daniel, are you guys planning on bidding on the auction in Brazil for, I think it's 2.5 and 3.5 gig spectrum.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you guys &#x2013; I think there's probably going to &#x2013; they are hoping to get an auction off at some point, probably not until next year, but I think they are going to auction off the 2.5...</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for spectrum in Brazil, are you guys planning on bidding in that spectrum &#x2013; in that auction?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2.5, I don't know if the &#x2013; I don't think &#x2013; I think let's see how does &#x2013; the world is going to evolve on the 2.5, but that still, at this moment, I think we prefer other frequencies than the 2.5, but I need to check and we need to see...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What are the technologies that are going to develop in those frequencies.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Walter, before you talk to Daniel, it is related to the traffic that you can have in the length of a call. You have certain calls that were...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I understand. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay? So you can follow up with Daniel, anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I understand, that's a better explanation. Thank you. And then the other question, Carlos, a lot of operators throughout the world are disclosing the percentage of their subscriber base that has smartphones. I may have missed this, are you guys &#x2013; have you guys done &#x2013; or can you give us some sense of what that is, either on a total company basis or in Mexico or Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been disclosing the growth on data; we have not been disclosing the amount of handsets. But I don't know. I need to check. I &#x2013; it's because of competition issues, but I don't know what &#x2013; let me...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give us a good sense of what your growth opportunity is &#x2013; if you could provide that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think more or less we have 15% of our base in postpaid. So today it's growing, so I don't know exactly what amount of those postpaids are smartphones and that they are using data. I don't have it in my mind right now. But what we are targeting is to have all our postpaids with smartphones and with data. And don't forget prepaid. Prepaid is going to be like &#x2013; even that they are going to use a small amount of data, there is going to be a lot of customers there. So we are planning to give data to also these customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my last question is just related to that. I mean, you said earlier on the call, it's important to have cheaper handsets. I mean, you guys have a good relationship with AT&amp;T; you've seen the success that they have had in selling the iPhone 3GS at a low price...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are doing that exactly in Mexico. I think that's something that we are selling in Mexico. We are doing very well, and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So why not in Brazil?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not only the Apple, the iPhone, we are also having other promotions that have been very successful in Mexico and in Brazil, in Latin America.</p>

          <p>That's why we're doing promotions...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think TIM, but TIM has been selling a 3GS and obviously the taxes make it expensive, but it's a lot cheaper than buying an iPhone 4.</p>
