          <p>Okay. Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. You saw in the press release this morning, third quarter earnings per share of $1.37, that's down 4% versus 2011. The Goodrich acquisition, previously anticipated to be about $0.10 dilutive in the quarter, did not have an impact on EPS due to lower one-time deal-related costs, lower amortization and better underlying performance of the business.</p>
          <p>IAE also had a solid performance in the quarter and contributed $0.03 of EPS. Restructuring charges were also lower than we expected due to a shift in the timing from the third to the fourth quarter and were completely offset by one-time gains. There was also a $0.04 benefit versus prior year on the tax line in the third quarter, which we talked to you about at our September Investor Meeting.</p>
          <p>The year-over-year benefit from restructuring and taxes nearly offset a $0.07 adverse impact from foreign exchange and a 2% decline on organic sales, driven mainly by the slowing global economy, and a decline in U.S. defense spending. Organic sales declined 12% at Sikorsky and were down 1% and 2% respectively at Otis and Climate, Controls &amp; Security.</p>
          <p>Organic sales in Aerospace Systems were up 6%. But as you heard from Dave Hess, we've yet to see a recovery in Pratt's large commercial engine aftermarket business. Organically, Pratt &amp; Whitney's large spare sales declined 25% in the quarter and we now expect the full-year to be down high-teens. For UTC, we now expect full-year sales of approximately $58 billion at the low end of our previous guidance range driven by lower organic sales and partially offset by favorable FX, compared to our last forecast.</p>
          <p>Despite of the top line softening, we continue to expect earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 for 2012. With a solid start at Goodrich, better visibility on the amortization and lower than expected deal costs, we estimate that Goodrich dilution, excluding the impact of share repurchase, will be approximately $0.10 for 2012 as opposed to our prior expectation of $0.20; that's about $125 million better. And we expect a $50 million pre-tax benefit from a full-year tax rate of 29%; that's 50 basis points lower than our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Against an uncertain macroeconomic environment headed into 2013, we are preemptively increasing restructuring by $100 million in the fourth quarter. We now plan to invest $600 million this year, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. And for the full year, we now expect restructuring to be equal to one-time gains. And as spare order rates have remained depressed at Pratt &amp; Whitney, we're also lowering Pratt's operating profit estimate by $75 million for the year.</p>
          <p>So let me sum it all up. There's $175 million of upside; that's Goodrich, $125 million, and the tax rate of $50 million, offset by $100 million of additional restructuring and $75 million of headwind from Pratt commercial spares. There's also some favorability from the weaker dollar versus our previous FX guidance and this should help offset the potentially softer top line of some of the commercial units.</p>
          <p>Okay, now on to slide 2; the third quarter. Total sales were up 6% with acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 11 points of growth. The net acquisition benefit more than offset 3 points of unfavorable FX and 2 points of organic decline. The drop in organic sales is just a reflection of the global economic environment. North America's still struggling to gain traction, a slight recession in Europe and slowing growth in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>At the commercial businesses, North American organic sales were flat in the quarter and are only up 1% year-to-date. In Europe in the commercial businesses, sales were actually down 3% while sales in the BRIC countries grew 2%. That was driven by double-digit growth in Russia and India. In Aerospace, robust commercial OEM organic growth was more than offset by weakness in the commercial aftermarket and military businesses. Commercial OEM sales were up 14% led by double-digit growth in Aerospace Systems and Sikorsky.</p>
          <p>Commercial aftermarket however was down 14% with a mid-teens decline at Pratt &amp; Whitney, more than offsetting mid-single-digit growth at Aerospace Systems and 20% growth at Sikorsky. Sikorsky continues to feel the impact of reduced DOD spending with military sales down nearly 20%. While Pratt &amp; Whitney saw military sales up 20% on the back of F119 spare engine deliveries, which will wrap up later this year.</p>
          <p>Excluding Goodrich and the incremental IAE shares, segment operating margin was 16.1%, so actually up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Our focus on cost reduction and productivity more than offset 80 basis points of headwind from pension, E&amp;D and FX.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, very good in the quarter, 105% and that included a $200 million contribution to our domestic pension plan. We've taken the tough actions on our pension plan and we're well positioned with a funded ratio of 84%, even with the impact of Goodrich at historically low discount rates. And we have no ERISA funding requirements until at least 2015.</p>
          <p>Okay, moving on to slide 3, looking at order trends; similar to sales order trends in the quarter were generally in line with the global economy. CCS' North American residential HVAC orders were up 3%. Otis new equipment orders were up 11% at constant currency, including strength in North America. China new equipment orders contracted 2% at constant currency in the quarter, following a 16% decline in the first half as we steadily regained momentum.</p>
          <p>I'd also note that the Q3 2% drop in orders is off a very tough compare with Q3 of last year when orders were up 31%. Across the Aerospace businesses we continued to see the impact of cash conservation at the airlines. Pratt &amp; Whitney's large commercial spare orders were up 14% in the quarter, including the additional share of IAE. Excluding the incremental share, Pratt's orders were actually down 21% due to weakness primarily in the wide-body fleet. Legacy Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spare orders were down 6%.</p>
          <p>So despite some weakness in our end markets, we continue to leverage our global scale and product innovation to strengthen the position of our industry-leading franchises. Backlog for our base businesses increased by $3 billion so far in 2012 and with the addition of Goodrich and IAE, total backlog now stands at $81 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me stop there and turn it over to Jay to take you through the business units and then I'll come back and wrap up 2012 and talk a little bit about 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turning to page 4; at Otis, operating profit was down 10% on a 6% decline in sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales and profit by 6 points. Operating margin was 22.7%, 1 point lower than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down low single-digit, with mid-single digit declines in Europe and China, partially offset by mid-single digit growth in the Americas and the rest of Asia.</p>
          <p>Service was up slightly with higher contractual maintenance more than offsetting a slight decline in repair. The operating profit decline was driven by pricing pressure and lower volume in Europe and the absence of favorable real estate gains in last year's third quarter, which more than offset the benefit of cost reduction actions this quarter.</p>
          <p>At constant currency, new equipment orders were up 11% with over 20% growth in North America and in Europe, which benefited from a major contract award in the U.K. Although orders in China were down 2% in the quarter, the rate of decline improved from the previous two quarters and Otis had solid order growth in September. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profits expected to be down $175 million to $225 million on a mid-single digit sales declines.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, UTC Climate, Controls &amp; Security once again saw a sharp increase in margin, up 270 basis points from prior year to 15.4% as profits increased 5% on 13% lower sales. Organic sales were down 2% as many of our end markets have not rebounded as we have previously expected. While there were pockets of growth, such as the Americas residential HVAC business and China each up mid-single digit, the balance of the business generally saw low single-digit declines.</p>
          <p>Transicold was down high teens organically led by a 60% decline in container sales. Despite the lack of organic sales growth, CCS grew earnings 5% or 8% at constant currency. Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire &amp; Security and favorable net commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Global commercial HVAC orders were flat with growth in North America, offset by a decline in Asia. Transicold orders were down about 25% with container down about 90%, partially offset by over 40% growth in North America truck/trailer. Orders for global Fire &amp; Security products were up low single-digit.</p>
          <p>Given current market softness, fourth quarter organic growth could be softer than previously anticipated. The CCS team continues to take preemptive action to offset the impact of lower organic sales but full year earnings guidance is under pressure. Margin expansion for the year however will still be strong given the benefits from productivity, cost reduction and portfolio transformation.</p>
          <p>Turning to Aerospace on slide 6; at Pratt &amp; Whitney, sales were up 16% in the third quarter, driven by the consolidation of IAE and the auxiliary power business transferred from Hamilton Sundstrand. Organically, sales were down 1% year-over-year as higher military and power systems sales were more than offset by lower commercial aftermarket. Large commercial spare sales were down 25% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, large commercial spare sales were up 9%, including consolidated IAE sales. Operating profit in the quarter was down 10%, the impact of lower organic sales, including large commercial spares, higher E&amp;D and pension costs as well as unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada were partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, restructuring savings and a supplier settlement of about $0.04 per share. For the full year we now expect Pratt &amp; Whitney operating profit to be down $175 million to $200 million on sales up mid-single-digit.</p>
          <p>On page 7, our new segment, UTC Aerospace Systems, including Hamilton Sundstrand and two months of Goodrich, posted sales in the quarter of $2.7 billion with operating profit of $306 million. Organic sales in the quarter were up 6% with OEM sales up high single-digit, commercial aftermarket up mid-single-digit and military aftermarket down 10%. Total aftermarket trends at Goodrich business units were slightly below legacy Hamilton Sundstrand.</p>
          <p>As Greg mentioned, Goodrich had better than expected results in the quarter; organic operating profit at Aerospace Systems was down 5% after a strong first half, which was up 16%. The benefit from higher volume was more than offset by higher E&amp;D and pension costs and lower license fees. With the benefit of approximately $50 million from lower than expected amortization, we now expect UTC Aerospace Systems' operating profit for the full year to be up $275 million to $300 million on approximately $4 billion of higher sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorsky on slide 8; operating profit decreased 6% on 6% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 62 aircraft; 54 aircraft were based on military platforms and 8 commercial. Lower sales were driven by fewer international military aircraft deliveries.</p>
          <p>On profit, the impact from lower international military aircraft and transition to the new multiyear contract more than offset favorable commercial aircraft mix, lower E&amp;D spend and restructuring benefits across the enterprise. Of note, Sikorsky has received FAA certification for the S-76D. Deliveries will commence in the fourth quarter and Sikorsky already has a backlog of over $400 million for this aircraft. For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of $50 million to $75 million on mid-single-digit sales decline.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks, Jay. Businesses are clearly seeing softening on the top line from these tough end market conditions, but we remain focused on program execution and cost reduction, the things that we can control. At CCS, we continue to make very good progress on the integration of legacy Carrier and F&amp;S businesses. Through consolidating locations and back office function and streamlining customer service processes, we've saved over $50 million year-to-date without an impact on the customer. And CCS continues to stabilize the U.K. Fire &amp; Security business, which grew profits for the second straight quarter.</p>
          <p>Otis China is also making progress in regaining its leadership position. On the Aerospace side, the Goodrich integration is off to a very good start. As you heard from Alain Bellemare in September, we are realizing synergies sooner than expected and there will be opportunities for more.</p>
          <p>Pratt continues to win orders for the GTF and with an additional 546 firm and option orders in the quarter, Pratt now has a backlog of nearly 3,000 engines. And Sikorsky, as you just heard from Jay, achieved a major milestone this month, certifying the S-76D, with deliveries starting here in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The end market challenges are putting pressure on the business unit expectations for 2012, but with lower dilution from Goodrich, we're confident in our guidance range of $5.25 to $5.35. We continue to negotiate towards a win, win solution with the Canadian government for the Sikorsky Maritime Helicopter and we expect to provide you with an update at our December meeting.</p>
          <p>And with strong cash generation you've come to expect from us, we now anticipate free cash flow will exceed net income for the year.</p>
          <p>Okay, slide 10, let's talk a little bit about 2013. The earnings framework for next year is the same that we've laid out in September, with the exception of the Goodrich amortization. With about $100 million of lower full year amortization, we now expect nearly $0.60 of accretion next year from Goodrich compared with the $0.10 of dilution in 2012 and we continue to expect an incremental $0.05 benefit from a full year of IAE.</p>
          <p>Turning to the base businesses; we've got great products and we're well positioned in the right markets for long-term growth. In addition to continuing growth from emerging markets, we should see solid growth in 2013 in the commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket and the U.S. residential HVAC business and in the U.S. commercial construction businesses. We expect Europe to be essentially flat next year, and we expect the declines in the U.S. defense spending to continue, even without the impact of the potential sequestration.</p>
          <p>Bottom line is that we're confident in our cost reduction and program execution and we have significant operating leverage, should we see better than expected end market conditions. Of course we still face some other significant headwinds in 2013. As you heard from Mick Maurer back in September, Sikorsky expects lower sales next year and 100 basis points to 200 basis points of margin headwind before CMHP. Now that's primarily due to the new Multi Year 8 and the lower DOD spending that we've been talking about.</p>
          <p>And of course, we'll have about $300 million of pension headwind at the current discount rate of 3.8%. We won't actually set the rate of course until year-end, but you know the math, every 10 basis points change of the rate costs us $28 billion.</p>
          <p>To sum it up, we've taken proactive aggressive restructuring actions this year. Savings from these actions, combined with lower engineering and development will drive earnings growth in four out of the five business units before pension, and we will see about $0.75 of accretion from Goodrich and IAE year-over-year. We feel well calibrated for this year, the large deals are done and we're focused on integration and execution. With our transformational deals, the new organizational structure, global industry-leading franchises and sustained structural cost reduction, we're well-positioned for long-term earnings growth and strong cash generation.</p>
          <p>With that, let's open up the call for questions. Stephanie?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. Start out over at Pratt, and Greg I'm just wondering, you had your meeting, September 27, obviously very late in the quarter and you're lowering hereby $75 million, I think all due to spares. So is it really &#x2013; I mean, can we infer from that, that really two weeks at the end of the quarter was responsible for the change in guidance or is it maybe just looking more into the fourth quarter? And also at Pratt, if you could quantify that supplier payment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah, I think Dave laid it out pretty well back in September. He said that we are not seeing the order rates to actually support the spares only down 10%. So, I think Dave was pretty forthright with everybody to say that we're not seeing it and clearly the last couple of weeks of September, we did not see any recovery in spares, and we haven't seen it as we sit here today. So, the takedown is all spares and I think again it's unfortunate to take down the guidance late in the year, but it is what it is on commercial spares.</p>
          <p>I think the good news is, we dissect the data, the narrow-body platforms, the V2500s and the 757s are actually &#x2013; have been recovering for a couple of quarters. And where we see the weakness is primarily on the wide-body fleet and also in Europe. So, again, not a surprise, I think, but it's clearly a tough &#x2013; a tough market right now.</p>
          <p>As far as the supplier payment, that was about $45 million, $46 million I think. It's actually a settlement; it was a legacy claim between Pratt and Goodrich, which relates to the &#x2013; from the sale on the CSeries. Now this had been in arbitration, we had an independent arbitrary come in and we settled the claim and that was actually recorded on Goodrich's balance sheet as of the close and Pratt recognized the benefit in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, on Goodrich, you mentioned that Goodrich earnings were better than expected. Is that due to less amortization or is that real underlying performance and what was &#x2013; I don't know if I missed it, but what was the organic aftermarket growth at Goodrich during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, organic aftermarket for sales was slightly below HS. HS had about mid-single-digit growth in commercial aftermarket and Goodrich is a little bit below that. As far as military aftermarket, HS was down around 10% and Goodrich was down a little bit below that, close to mid-teens. While we have the chance, I just want to correct a statement that I made before, related to Sikorsky on slide 8; I just want to clarify that operating profit decreased 6% on 12% lower sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to the first part of your question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...as far as the underlying business, Goodrich did do a little bit better than what we had expected. Again it was primarily the Aerostructures at the end of the quarter, things actually looked better, but amortization is clearly better. The big piece in the quarter was really these transaction-related costs, which were better than what we had expected. We took, I'd say, a very conservative view as we were looking at all of these costs and we had expected to expense some things that ended up on Goodrich's balance sheet. So that helped by about $100 million and then you had better performance and a little bit better amortization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the Otis order strength in North America. It sounds like Europe may be driven by the big Metro project, maybe if there's something else there, elaborate on that also, but what was going on in North America? And is it more than a one-off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's a trend that we have seen a recovery in North America, and we've seen the ABI, Architectural Billings Index, be above 50 for the last couple of months here and actually seeing good traction in quarters there. We've got of course some new product introductions also that's helping on &#x2013; in North America, attacking some of the hydro markets. So, I think it's product introduction and a recovery there. So that actually feels pretty good. Europe &#x2013; well, Europe is Europe. We did get good traction out of the Crossrail project. I think that's over 107 escalators for that London Crossrail. But the rest of Europe is not a great story. We saw down markets in France and Spain and Italy. A little bit better in Germany, but on the whole, a pretty tough year of market outside of the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then when you look at China down 2%, are you in position, given kind of the comps and the trajectory to actually flip positive on orders in Q4? Or when do you see that happening, if you can in fact crystallize the view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my crystal ball's not terribly clear, but I would tell you we should be seeing order growth resume in Q4. As I said earlier, orders were down 2%, but that was off of a very tough compare last year where orders were up 31% at constant currency. And so we are seeing a recovery. Last year, you'll recall, China only grew 7% in the fourth quarter. So again I think the trajectory that we saw coming out of the third quarter should continue into the fourth quarter. I think Pedro and team feel very confident. We're getting share back and they're on track for a full recovery there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just can you give us a little more granularity on China? Is it high rise resi, is it bigger projects; central country, just any other detail on what's going on would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's actually really across the business, we are seeing a recovery there. The commercial HVAC business remains soft there I think. So some of the slowdowns that we've seen are actually playing out on the CCS side. On the flipside, residential's getting a little bit better. We saw that at CCS on their GST business, getting us some traction in order rates. For Otis, again, I think the property market has started to stabilize and come back a little bit. Still seeing good growth in the Tier 2 and 3 cities. Tier 1 is still pretty challenged but again that's not a surprise. I think it's a very uneven recovery in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And just finally, just flipping over to Carrier, it looks like your resi business underperformed from what I can see from a couple others who reported in the quarter. Can you just give us some color on how you thought you did relative to the broader market and what's going on in the channels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, underperformance is a relative term, Jeff. I think, again, we saw I think one of the competitors reported the other day, they had a, what looked like kind of, mid teens growth in the resi business, but I think that was off of a very tough, or very easy compare from 2011. And Carrier thinks they have held share here this year, they've done pretty well. Channel inventories are very, very light. I think nobody wants to get stuck with inventory at this time of the year, given all the uncertainty in the global economic situation and the fiscal cliff coming up, so channel inventories are probably at some of the lowest levels we've seen.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one quick one, actually a couple of quick ones. On the transport refrigeration on the container side, you said sort of down 90%, which is where you were at your Analyst Meeting. Did you see any incremental order activity, besides that little blip you called out in the meeting, or are we still kind of bouncing along the bottom in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, bouncing along the bottom is a relative term. Yeah, I think we saw a little bit of good news post the Investor Meeting and we've seen some good news here in the fourth quarter. We're almost 50% booked in the fourth quarter. So, orders, again, they're very lumpy as we know in this business, but, yeah, I think it looks achievable in terms of the forecast we've got out there right now for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the spares side, I wondered if you might elaborate on a couple of other points. In terms of the wide-bodies, what you're seeing in terms of shop visits year-over-year, and also what you're seeing at Pratt Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, shop visits are a little soft on the wide-body fleet, and this is again, the PW4000 fleet. I think the biggest impact is on the 747 fleet, probably a lesser impact than the 777 and A330 fleet out there. But clearly we've seen lower shop visits, but I think more importantly, the average cost per shop visit is down substantially, like 25% now. So that's just gotten worse and not better from what we've seen earlier this year. We're getting good traction as I said on the narrow-body fleet, Vs are up very strong, the spares in the quarter and even the 2000s have had a nice recovery for the last couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pratt Canada spares were down low single digit in the quarter, Carter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And one final one, you said Europe flat for next year is your kind of base-case assumption, does that assume anything different in terms of FX for next year than what's baked into this year's guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think again, FX, I think is around 1.30 today. We've actually put our plan together at 1.25 kind of euro right now as we're looking at guidance for the last couple of months. So, FX could actually be, instead of a tailwind next year, versus what we've seen this year, I think we're going to average 1.26 or something year-to-date I think, so could actually be a little bit of tailwind out of FX but who the heck knows.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On CC&amp;S you had good margins there for the quarter. Could you talk about what the puts and takes were with respect to margin? You didn't change guidance for the year, and I was also wondering if the margins &#x2013; were those above your expectations, but being offset by weakness in the top line for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess that's exactly it. Margins were very strong. We got about a third of that came from the portfolio transformation, but the rest of it really came from cost reduction &#x2013; product cost reduction and restructuring and cost takeout in the base business. So I think again it's &#x2013; it looks like the margins for this year will be at least 14% or so, so well on their way to the 15% goal that we've got out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look across the business, the Fire &amp; Security businesses and the individual parts within Carrier, are there some that you would point to where you saw more improvement than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the field, Doug, both Europe and Asia were relatively flat from sales perspective. Orders for products were actually up low single-digit this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you're seeing though, Doug, is really broad-based cost reduction. I think, again, the structural cost takeout that we talked about is healthy, but we're also seeing good news out of the factories, we're seeing good cost reduction out of the factories, and that's both legacy F&amp;S as well as legacy Carrier businesses. Margins are holding up quite well on the commercial side, as well as on the resi side here in the U.S. Obviously margins are under a little pressure at Transicold with volumes down as much as they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the restructuring, the increase in restructuring cost for the year, can you talk about where that's focused; Aero versus the commercial businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got a lot of programs lined up here, I think the biggest piece you'll probably see is going to be related to what we see as kind of this decline in defense spending. So Sikorsky will have a good share of that. Pratt will pick up a big piece, as well as UTAS, or Aerospace Systems business, but again I would tell you, there's restructuring appetite across all the businesses. Otis continues to find ways to take cost out. CCS, again, they're just starting on their journey from this structural cost reduction. So, you'll see additional restructuring from each of the businesses. And I would tell you, when we started the year, I didn't see the appetite for $300 million, let alone $600 million for restructuring. And today, there's appetite for more than $600 million. So, yeah, I think that just tells you how focused these guys are on cost reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank &#x2013; excuse me, thank you very much. Greg, I realize how challenged it's been to forecast earnings and still stay within the range and so the harder question is, could you help us a little bit with cash and sort of give us the walk as to where you were with the debt pay down plans, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So cash actually came in about what we expected, we get about 105% of net income, we're at 100% of net income year-to-date. The cash machine continues to chug right along. And I think for the year, we have solid visibility, we will nicely exceed net income and cash flow for the year.</p>
          <p>As far as the debt pay down, I think we're still on track, we expect to close on the Hamilton Industrial businesses kind of early December timeframe. We've got a $2 billion term loan that we'll pay down. We've got about $4 billion of commercial paper. And then we'll pay down probably another $1 billion of other debt this year. So &#x2013; and most of that &#x2013; the rest of that cash will come from overseas. So, we've got line of sight to, I'll tell you, about $7 billion of debt pay down by the end of the year. Something might slip into the first quarter, but I think clearly line of sight to the $7 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And related to that, looks like you did a &#x2013; I mean you had a terrific number on &#x2013; well, you haven't closed yet on Electrical Products, but based on the filing, it would seem to me that you're going to more than exceed your forecast on some of the other divestitures. Is that a fair way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the market for these businesses is much stronger than was originally anticipated. And it's not &#x2013; I guess it shouldn't be surprising. These are really good franchises, and franchises like the EPS business, Electric Power business at Goodrich, don't come on the market very often. So we had a very robust bidding process for that business, as well as for the Engine &amp; Controls business, it's located here in West Hartford. That bidding process was also robust. It's moving right along. So I'd say we'll be at the high end of our expectation range for both of those businesses, but again, good solid businesses, great products and technology. Hate to lose them, but again, part of the regulatory process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then related to corporate overhead, I mean, it looks as if you've been able to put together United Technologies and Goodrich, and not really increase the overhead a whole heck of a lot. Are there some other gains or anything in there? Or what should we think about that in terms of going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly as we put the Goodrich business together with Hamilton, we have seen or will see about $50 million of cost synergies this year. A big piece of that is the public company costs. So I think, Alain, as you would expect, is focused on a lean organization. We're not adding a lot of overhead and you're going to see that I think play out next year as well as we continue to see solid cost reduction out of the Goodrich business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, you talked about avoiding a lot of transaction cost in the quarter and that was pretty helpful and then you're talking about increasing restructurings. Did those two items sort of in the end offset each other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, if you think about it, we picked up about $0.10 on the Goodrich dilution this year and we picked up about $0.04 on the tax rate. You can offset that, we lost about $0.08 on restructuring and we lost about $0.06 on the Pratt guidance reduction, so $75 million. So, $14 million good, $14 million bad, it just kind of offset it just naturally, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Howard.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I want to go back to CC&amp;S for a minute, Greg, and again put a little finer point on it. It looks like you were saying, to an earlier question, that you anticipate maintaining profitability going forward, but then you have some of the more profitable businesses which have been rather weak, so wouldn't that intimate that you could do even on potentially very slow revenue upside next year better margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you will see better margins next year at CCS. Again, it's a little early to call the markets next year, but generally, I think Geraud and team feel pretty confident we should see a recovery at Transicold next year, especially on the container side. I think the U.S. res business, again with housing starts up, should recover next year. Commercial side in the U.S. ought to do better. So I think we're well on track. Again, I said 14% this year, 15% is the goal by 2015. They're well on their way to getting there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's what I'm trying to drive to. I mean, you could get there quite a bit earlier, I mean again, just given that you've had some of the more profitable stuff down and you've been doing the restructuring on an ongoing basis. So you'll start to get those benefits as early as next year. Is there some part of that I'm not getting right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you're right on. Again, I'm hesitant to say we're going to get to 15% next year because again, who knows what happens in the end markets. I think Geraud and team have done a great job this year managing in what is a very, very tough macro environment. They've taken out costs. They've driven up margins. They're done their portfolio rationalization. And they're going to hit that 14% this year. Can they hit 15% next year? Maybe, but I think again that's a great question maybe for Louis in December or better yet for Geraud next March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And turning on to Sikorsky, I just want to tease those businesses out a little bit better to understand the kind of puts and takes you're seeing there, Greg. Can you give us a little color on your aftermarket expectations in military and your outlook for international military orders looking ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's just talk about military spares; military spares, obviously it's a tough market right now down at Sikorsky and we expect that that will be a headwind again next year. Again, not a surprise with the OPTEMPO coming down in Afghanistan. And the uncertainty down at DOD, I think we've seen a reluctance of the procurement officers to go out and make advanced buys with all the uncertainty out there, coming to a head in January. So, those spares have been under pressure and they will remain under pressure next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as military aircraft, you'll recall that Mick during September said that a part of the international military deliveries got pushed into 2014 because of the finalization &#x2013; delay in finalization of Multi Year 8 contract signing.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Jay, what I meant was orders, do you guys have a number of campaigns out there? Can you bring us up to speed on the campaigns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually, I would tell you that there is a robust process there on the international side. I think we're seeing good traction in South America. We're seeing good traction in the Middle East, we're seeing traction in India. I think again you'll see international BLACK HAWK, the S-70i out of Mielec just start to pick up next year. And the deliveries really &#x2013; I think Mick has clear line of sight to 2014 to see a large increase in these international BLACK HAWK deliveries.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, I was hoping you could make it a little bit simpler for me in terms of into 2013 with Goodrich and IAE, you increased or lowered the dilution for Goodrich for 2012 and you had previously talked about a $0.75 EPS swing, 2012 into 2013. Is that $0.75 still intact or are we now talking about a lower swing because 2012 showed up better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's &#x2013; well, I think the math is, as I would say, it's complicated, but the fact is we have $0.10 of dilution now on Goodrich this year and $0.60 of accretion. So net, net year-over-year, you ought to get a $0.70 benefit because of Goodrich plus $0.05 on IAE. We previously had talked about $0.20 of dilution this year and $0.50 of accretion next year. The fact is next year it gets better because of lower amortization costs, lower than expected. So that gets you next year from the $0.50 to the $0.60 and that benefit also helps this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on spares, Greg, I think you said high teens organic declines. Could you separate &#x2013; create the differential on the organic declines between for the full year what you're seeing on the 2500s versus the wide-bodies? And then also the wide-bodies, can you parse out what's just been retired and taken out of the fleet that never comes back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can't give you the granularity in terms of what may have been retired. I think clearly as we were talking earlier, the 747-400s, the PW4000s those have been probably the hardest hit. Now whether some of those have been retired or not, I couldn't tell you, clearly flying hours were down on that fleet. On the other hand, you see 777s, again the 4000, those are 112-inch, those &#x2013; the flying hours were actually up, we just have seen the airlines be very reticent to spend a lot of money at repairing the engines as they've come back. So, again, I think, 747-400s are probably the hardest hit and then 777s less so. And then, again, real solid recovery on the Vs as we had expected when we bought IAE.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. So this year, the Goodrich &#x2013; maybe you could walk us through, so you said like $50 million lower intangibles, maybe &#x2013; but you had, R&amp;D was $101 million, so presumably, that was an accounting conformity negative. So maybe walk us through what are the step-up in intangibles this year for Goodrich? What should we think about for next year? You said $100 million lower, but from what to what? What should the accounting conformity be this year and next year? And you mentioned synergies, $50 million; what is it next year? And what is the restructuring? Is any of the incremental restructuring there at Goodrich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start out with the amortization for this year. I think that we have seen lower amortization. So I think there was $140 million of amortization we now expect for the year. Is that right? Yeah, I think &#x2013; I'm sorry, that's for the quarter, $140 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$140 million was the absolute number of amortization in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in the third quarter. $130 million of that was from inventory step-up; about $10 million of that was the net of inventory intangible amortization. So again, you should see that inventory will repeat again in fourth quarter as well as the intangible amortization. Next year, there's no inventory amortization. I think that's all behind us. So what you're down to is about $50 million of intangible amortizations net next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Cai, the best way to look at it, if you recall the charts that we've shown, we've lumped amortization and conformity together, it was $500 million previously. The best way to look at it is that now goes to $400 million, the combination of those two items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But so let's just stick with this quarter, so we have $100 million this quarter of accounting conformity because I guess I'm a little confused, if you had $140 million of accounting intangibles in step-up, $100 million of accounting conformity in synergies, a little tough for me to see how you got to breakeven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the $100 million is really the run rate for the accounting conformity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Cai, $100 million is the total E&amp;D at Goodrich. Part of that E&amp;D always went to the P&amp;L; it was just put into SG&amp;A in their former reporting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the piece &#x2013; I can't tell you. I don't know what that piece is just on an accounting conformity basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, so we're really going to get like a $280 million swing next year because you're going to lose &#x2013; the inventory step-up is all this year, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the restructuring, you said $100 million. Given you've taken your total restructuring up, is Goodrich still $100 million? And what should we think about for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Goodrich, for restructuring this year, is closer to about $150 million. We said, I think, next year in the range of $100 million. As far as amortization though, Cai, we just have to recall that next year is 12 months versus 5 months this year on amortization.</p>

          <p>Morning, Ron.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When we think about going into the fourth quarter and we think about what you guys are implying about where the fourth quarter numbers will be compared year-over-year, things kind of really decelerate into the fourth quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about it? Or you are just being conservative? Or how should we think about the fourth quarter number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what you're going to see is you see pretty good acceleration in the base businesses. The segment results should be better. I think you'll see solid growth at CCS; you'd see over $100 million of earnings growth there. You should see a little bit of growth come back at Otis. Again, Sikorsky should have a very big fourth quarter; they've got almost 100 helicopters to deliver. So base business is actually going to do very, very well here in the fourth quarter. I think we've got confidence that we're going hit that number. The downside, I think, as we think about fourth quarter actual EPS, is you've got about $0.25 of headwind in the fourth quarter from restructuring. And not surprising, we've got about $270 million of restructuring to go. We've spent $330 million so far, so you're going to see a big <mark type="ph" /> nook (46:50) $0.25 or so of net restructuring in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then maybe over to Sikorsky real quick; any more color on what's going on with the Canadian Maritime Helicopter and where that negotiation with the Canadian government is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to say we're making good progress. What we want here, and I said it before, we need a win, win on this with the Canadian government. Obviously, we're disappointed. We haven't been able to deliver the helicopters. We're building them right now down in West Palm. We'd expected to build and deliver 5 this year; build and deliver 19 next year, and we're well on our way for all those helicopters. But until we have an agreement with the Canadian government in terms of the final configuration and an interim configuration, we really can't ship anything. So as I sit here today, I'd tell you, we don't have a solution. I certainly hope by the time Louis stands up in early December, we can give you guys some more clarity on it, but right now, all I know is that we need to continue to work with the Canadians to find a win, win here.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then maybe just one last quick one on Aero aftermarket. Do you have a sense for what impact cargo has had versus passenger, meaning, is your cargo business much more off than your passenger business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ron, I really don't have a lot of granularity between cargo versus regular. I would tell you, the cargo's not a big piece of the fleet and the hours on cargo are much lower than the hours that we see on the regular commercial flights. So the overall cycle is much, much longer. So haven't seen a pronounced impact from cargo versus commercial.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason I ask is if you go back a couple of years after 2008, Goodrich had a couple of rough quarters, largely due to cargo. I'm just trying to get a sense for what impact it's having now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Greg, I just wanted to get to this Goodrich dilution a little differently. In the 8-K, you said the pro forma for 2011 was $0.50 a share accretion and now you've upped it to $0.60 in 2013. So what are the variables that go into that added $0.10 from 2011 to 2013? Obviously there's cost saves and whatever, there's some growth in the business, but if you could spell out the differences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, again, if you think about that $0.50 versus the $0.60, really, the only difference is lower net amortization for next year. This year, we had deal costs and we had a little bit of performance of the business as well as lower amortization, but next year we're really &#x2013; we are getting about &#x2013; well, we're getting north of $100 million of lower amortization, more like about almost $0.10, I guess, of lower amortization costs, probably $120 million, $130 million of lower amortization costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that's relative to 2011 I'm asking, not 2012, because you've provided the pro forma numbers in the 8-K that you disclosed a couple of weeks ago and that showed $0.50 accretion in 2011 on the pro forma. So I was asking for the comparison 2011 to 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, George, I think we're going to have to get back to you on that. I have not gone back into these pro formas. I haven't focused on 2011 really much since last year. But we can go back and take a look and get an answer for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the other one, as you said, IAE will be accretive $0.05 next year, but it was accretive $0.03 this quarter. So why is it only $0.05 next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you get another half a year. So you're going to get $0.05 of accretion this year and another $0.05 next year, so $0.10 in total next year, $0.05 incrementally.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, just on your 2013 outlook, you've put the commercial aerospace aftermarket as a positive. Is that looking at on a reported basis because of the inclusion of IAE? Or is this looking at on an organic basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's on an organic basis, Rob. Again, if you think about Pratt spares being down high teens, we've seen Hamilton Sundstrand legacy down, we've seen Goodrich down a little bit. I think just based upon what we're seeing from a flying hours perspective, we know that we're going to see these spares come back and I think it's just a matter of time. And I don't know if that's first quarter, second quarter or third quarter of next year or even fourth quarter of this year, but spares will come back. So we've got high confidence we're going to see good news on the commercial aero aftermarket organically next year, not just the addition of the acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to follow-up on the aftermarket, you've given us quite a lot of detail on what you're seeing at Pratt with the wide-bodies but I was wondering if you could explain maybe what's going on in Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich and why the orders there in the spares there are a bit soft relative to flight hours, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's the $64,000 question on Aerospace. Again, Pratt we've got much better visibility because it's all time-based overhauls primarily. So we know the schedule when these engines are supposed to come back and for the most part they're coming back as we had expected because they're putting the flying hours on. On the Goodrich and the Hamilton legacy, that is all condition-based or on condition repairs. So in other words, if you have a failure in the field, you're going see the units come back in. And quite frankly these LRUs, the Line Replaceable Units, the airlines do have inventory of these various parts that Hamilton and Goodrich make and they're burning down inventory, we believe, and not sending everything back for repair.</p>
          <p>So again, I think we will see, just based upon flying hours, a recovery there to a more normal kind of 5% to 7% growth year-over-year, starting next year on the Aerospace Systems side, but this year I think it's just all about airline cash conservation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Hey, Greg, in terms of next year, when you think about the non-cash and the cash items, you're going to have a fair amount of non-cash stuff running through with the pension and the amortization. Are there any big kind of cash offsets in terms of pension contributions or working capital dynamics in the businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's two offsets that we have to keep in mind that we still have to manage. One is there's an appetite for additional inventory to support the build on the commercial OE side. So again, I think we see pressure at Pratt &amp; Whitney, we see pressure at the Aerospace Systems side for inventory. And we also see an appetite for those businesses for CapEx. And I think that's, again, something we need to meter out effectively and we need to make sure that we take full advantage of all the facilities that we now have between Pratt, legacy Hamilton and Goodrich. So I think initially everybody wants to build everything new, buy everything new, we just need to think about that and we'll come back with the specific guidance, but I'd tell you, there's pressure on CapEx and there's pressure on working capital, specifically inventory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And pension contributions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we made $200 million of pension contributions this year, because cash, as I said, has been very strong. It's actually a good place to put our money. We get an 8% return on it in the pension plan, but we have no funding requirements under the ERISA rules until at least 2015 and quite frankly, we're 84% funded at the pension plan today and if I get to a discount rate of 5.5%, which is where we were two years ago, we'd be fully funded. So the last thing we want to do is throw more cash into the pension plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just can you explain a little more why the Goodrich amortization went down? Did you assign a lower value to something that would have been amortized, if you just explain that a little more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what we found is there were several contracts in the legacy Goodrich business, which were in loss making positions. And as we've changed the accounting to our accounting conformity, we had to recognize those losses upfront. So we actually provided for that as a liability, if you will, going forward. That's now getting amortized and offsetting some of the other intangibles. Again, we initially had not expected to set up this liability, if you will, for these loss making contracts. Remember, under Goodrich accounting, they took a look at the contract over its life and had a very, very long-term view. We've got a, I'd say, like an 8-year life we're looking at these contracts. They're loss making. So we amortize the intangibles on these loss making contracts over that 8-year period.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. My first question was just on the Otis operating profit progression. So I guess you had pretty high decrementals in the mid-high 30% range in Q2 and Q3. You're saying that profits should grow though year-on-year in Q4, even though your revenues are probably down. So I guess I'm trying to figure out what's going on in the cost base? Is it to do with mix that you think European aftermarket maybe is now stabilizing in Q4? Or is it that you've added a lot of costs in places like China and that kind of hiring is now coming to an end, so you get a natural lift on incrementals or something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, there's two things that impacted first half of the decreasing margins. Part of that was pricing. We've talked about that. I think we've probably seen $75 million year-to-date of pricing impacts, about half of that in Europe. We've also had commodity headwind in the first half of the year related to the rare earth. Again, that was something that started playing out last year, and really by the middle of this year, by third quarter, had gone away, but certainly hurt first half margins. We've added a little bit of cost on the SG&amp;A line, but again, that's just positioning Otis to take advantage of what's going on over in China. We've moved the business and strategy development to Shanghai. We've opened up the high-rise CLC in Shanghai, so there's a little bit of investment, but really the story is &#x2013; in the first half, has been pricing and it's been commodities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly switching to your 2013 outlook, I just wondered, the commercial aero OEM side, that comes up in sort of a plus and a minus, is that just the difference between regions or wide-body versus narrow-body?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the reason we put commercial aero OEM up there as a positive, certainly on the revenue line, it will be a positive. There will be some headwind from negative margins on some of the &#x2013; especially on the engine side, and I think especially, probably on the &#x2013; there'll be the A380, the GP7000 engine, so as they ramp up production at Airbus, we'll see some headwind there. So, good news on the top line, not as much on the bottom line.</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Sam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a clarification once again on Goodrich, you had said in your prepared remarks that it's $125 million better, but then the I guess Aerospace Systems business, you're saying is only $50 million better for the year. What's the gap in there? Did you bring down the core at Hamilton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other piece, Sam, is related to the deal cost that Greg mentioned and that is in corporate/elims, so the $125 million, a piece of it is in the segment and a piece of it is in UTC corporate/elims.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the growth in the receivables of about $1 billion and inventories almost $2 billion, how much of that would be the core business versus just layering in Goodrich and I guess, IAE as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, most of that build is actually Goodrich and IAE. I don't know if I've got the exact numbers down here but &#x2013; actually let us get back to you Sam on that, but I think the large majority of those additional AR and inventory, all that working capital is really related to the acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the last thing is on the order rates, as we look into the fourth quarter, you've already mentioned North American, or just CCS easy comps, it looks like Pratt large commercial also has pretty easy comps. And even Otis new equipment isn't that bad. Should we be seeing positive bookings across all the segments in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think so, with the exception perhaps of Transicold. Again, I think last year fourth quarter was still pretty strong at Transicold. So, that's a pretty lumpy business as I said, so that would be the one caveat I'd say to order rates. Everything else &#x2013; again I think we had seen a pretty slow fourth quarter last year on the order intake side. So, should be pretty easy compares both at Otis and the Aero businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Pratt commercial spares, if you had the same dollar amount in this third quarter versus the easy compare in fourth quarter, would we actually see bookings up next year &#x2013; I mean next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, if we had orders in the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Similar dollars &#x2013; if it was just sequentially flat in the December quarter from the September quarter, do we end up with a positive comparison?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Sam. You would be down. Last year was pretty flat throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I want to thank everybody for listening. I know once again a lot of stuff going on in UTC here. We'll see you guys all in December next for Louis' annual guidance. We're going to continue to focus on what we do best, we're going to focus on integration, we're going to make sure we're accelerating on cost reduction and we're going to focus on outperforming the peers, and that's what we do everyday here. So, thanks everybody and have a great day.</p>
