          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2012 Praxair Earnings Conference Call. My name is Miranda, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Miranda. Good morning and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the full year and fourth quarter including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes previously disclosed adjustment in the third quarter of 2012 and fourth quarter of 2011. These items are detailed and reconciled to the GAAP reported numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Jim and I will now review Praxair's full year and fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for 2013 including earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kelcey and good morning everyone. Praxair delivered solid results for the full year 2012. Strong growth in our North American businesses was offset by significant currency headwinds and recessionary economic conditions in Europe and Brazil, resulting in relatively stable sales but continuing earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Excluding foreign currency and cost passthrough, full-year sales grew 5%; operating profit 6%; and EPS, 8%. This demonstrates that we continue to get leverage down the income statement by growing operating profits faster than sales through strong productivity, gains and price. EPS grew more than operating profit because of our strong return on capital and operating cash flow which provide for share repurchases. This is the hallmark of our leadership and commitment to solid execution, effective management of what we have under our control, particularly during times of challenging economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Our results for the fourth quarter were mixed as we had warned and at the beginning of the quarter. I hate to refer to the fiscal cliff, but budget anxiety and deferral of capital spending resulted from poor business confidence that's strongly evident in Europe, South America and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Demand for packaged gas is primarily from the metal fabrication and machinery industries slowed markedly in December as customers took extended holiday shutdowns in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe and particularly South America. These shutdowns extended into January and in Brazil and Asia will probably last into February due to the Carnival and Lunar New Year holidays.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we've issued rather uninspiring earnings guidance for the first quarter. By March, we expect packaged gases to resume the strong growth we've seen over the past several years.</p>
          <p>On the bright side, our onsite and merchant customers maintained solid demand through year-end as production from efficient steel mills, chemical plants and refinery runs continued strong. Moreover, we're clearly seeing a strong rebound in China now that the new communist party has taken hold and some of the delays in decision-making that we had seen in 2012 have ended. This augers well for exporters to China, specifically American and German machinery as well as commodities from North and South America.</p>
          <p>While we tend to be conservative and believe things only when we see them, I'm optimistic that the remainder of 2013 we'll get back on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Please turn to slide three for an overview of the 2012 full year results. As Jim commented earlier, Praxair delivered solid results in 2012. Overall sales were comparable with the prior year as full year organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 1% was offset by the impact of currency translation and natural gas pass-through.</p>
          <p>Our North America and Asia segments delivered strong volume growth during the year which was largely offset by lower volumes in Europe and South America. By end market, energy, manufacturing and metals showed the strongest growth from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of $2.5 billion was 6% above 2011 excluding foreign currency. Operating margin improved 40 basis points to a record 22.3%.</p>
          <p>During 2012, for the fourth year in a row, we achieved more than 6% savings in our cost stack through productivity. This amount was higher than our ongoing targeted 5% per year as the Praxair businesses accelerated initiatives during the year in production, procurement and distribution. Approximately 25% of our savings came from sustainable productivity initiatives with the largest being energy efficiency improvement in our plants.</p>
          <p>Our after-tax return on capital for the year was 13.9% and was suppressed by the large amount of projects we have under construction and therefore on our balance sheet, but which have not yet started up and are not yet earning revenues. Return on equity increased to 28.9%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide four. We generated record operating cash flow of $2.8 billion for the year which was equal to 25% of sales. Capital spending for the year was $2.2 billion, about 20% above 2011. 2012 capital spend at about 20% of sales was a larger than typical amount as this increase was driven by our strong backlog and the number of projects that we expect to start up in 2013. In a typical year, we spend about 15% of sales on capital projects.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we invested $280 million in acquisitions, primarily for 17 packaged gas distributors in North America and an industrial gas business in Russia. During 2012, we also purchased $459 million of stock net of issuances. $1 billion remains available under the share repurchase program that was authorized in 2012. We paid dividends of $655 million and this morning announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend for 2013, our 20th consecutive annual increase. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% and debt-to-EBITDA was 1.9 times reflecting our solid investment grade credit rating.</p>
          <p>During the course of 2012, we took advantage of low long-term interest rates as well as our tight issuance spreads to treasury and issued 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year bonds at record low yields. About 85% of our debt is now termed out with long-term securities.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide five for our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were $2.8 billion comparable to 2011. Strong growth in Asia and modest year-over-year growth in North America was offset by lower sales in South America and Europe. Sequentially, overall sales were modestly above the third quarter. Sequential sales growth in North America, Europe, and Asia was mitigated by lower sales in South America as many customers lowered production over the holiday.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $616 million as compared to $619 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating margin remained strong at 22%. Net income was $414 million in line with the prior year and earnings per share was $1.38 versus $1.36 in the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was a record $879 million and funded $586 million of capital expenditures, acquisitions of $171 million and dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page six for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 2% above the prior-year quarter. Organic sales growth was steady as increased price of 2% was offset by similar volume declines. Acquisitions of packaged gas distributors, primarily in the United States, contributed 1% sales growth.</p>
          <p>Onsite sales were strong and grew year-over-year and sequentially with the strongest growth to energy, metals, and chemicals. Energy was driven by our onsite supply assistance to refineries, the majority of which are in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.</p>
          <p>Pipeline oxygen sales to steel mills were strong as our steel customers are now very cost competitive globally. The fundamentals for our North American chemicals customers are strong as their production remains advantaged with plentiful low cost natural gas as a feedstock.</p>
          <p>Packaged gas sales were impacted at the end of the quarter by falling business confidence among our customers with metal fabrication and machine job shops.</p>
          <p>North American operating profit was $367 million, 4% above the prior year quarter. The operating margin was a very strong 25.9% reflecting pricing and productivity gains. In 2013, we are on track to start the two large hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur. And the hydrogen supply to serve Motiva in Louisiana.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have half a dozen air separation plants due to startup in North America in 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>Proposal activity for new onsite plants in North America remained strong, particularly to the cost-advantage chemical industry using natural gas as a feedstock. The list of potential chemical projects in the United States and therefore related opportunities for sale of gas continues to grow.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to page seven for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were 5% below the prior-year quarter due primarily to the weaker euro. Packaged gas volumes continued to decline due to weakness in the metal fabrication and manufacturing markets. During the quarter, we also saw German volumes decline modestly as machinery production fell. Operating profit of $60 million was 6% below the prior-year, driven primarily by negative currency translation effects.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we started up our first air separation plant in Russia. This plant will produce oxygen, nitrogen and compressed air for Kaustik, a division of Nikochem under a long-term contract in Volgograd in an industrial region in Southern Russia. The highly efficient plant with a capacity of 350 tons per day replaced older captive units and will reduce Kaustik's electricity consumption at the site by approximately 30%. The plant will also supply merchant products to local markets such as metals, metal fabrication, glass, automotive, food, electronics and healthcare.</p>
          <p>Page eight shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $484 million, 9% below the prior-year quarter due to negative currency impact, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian reais against the U.S. dollar. Sequentially, lower volumes across onsite merchant and packaged reduced sales by 7%.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, customers in Brazil extended holiday shutdown periods, accelerated maintenance and reduced inventories. This impacted most end markets with the largest decreases in manufacturing and metals customers which, represents about 55% of our sales.</p>
          <p>About 20% of Praxair sales in South America comes from the counties outside of Brazil. Underlying sales in these countries grew 11% versus the prior-year quarter and 2% sequentially, with growth in chemicals, food and beverage, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in South America was $92 million versus $118 million in the prior-year quarter. We remain very positive on Brazil in the medium-to-long-term given the strong growth fundamentals in place, and our 100 years of operating experience and strong position. We continue to see strong new project proposal activity. Proposal activity is broad-based across South America and Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, primarily in energy, manufacturing and metals.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide nine for our results in Asia. Sales of $374 million grew 12% versus the prior-year quarter. Volume growth of 12% came primarily from higher onsite sales in China, India and Korea, including new plant startups for metals and chemicals customers. We continue to see lower demand from the electronics end market, including semiconductor, flat panel displays and solar customers.</p>
          <p>Asia's operating profit of $69 million increased 15% from the prior-year quarter. Operating profit improved from higher volumes, as well as productivity gains. Our backlog of projects in Asia continues to be replenished by new signings as projects startup, and currently includes 20 projects in China, India, Korea and the Middle East that will startup between the first quarter of this year and into 2015.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we started our third production plant to supply Usha Martin Limited, India's leading wire and wire rope manufacturer. The plant will supply gaseous oxygen and nitrogen to support Usha Martin's expansion. We announced the signings of two projects that have been added to the backlog during the quarter, one in India and one in China.</p>
          <p>In India, we are expanding our supply of gaseous oxygen, nitrogen and argon to JSW's steel mill in Southern India. Praxair's Air Separation unit has a production capacity of 1,800 tons per day, and will add to the existing Praxair's supply of 6,800 tons per day currently. The plant will also supply merchant liquid to support growing demand in the region in the steel, cement, chemical, textile, pharmaceutical and automotive markets.</p>
          <p>In China, we signed a long-term supply contract to expand supply to our existing customer Jinlong Copper in Eastern China, with an estimated startup of mid-2014. We will invest to double the capacity of our air separation plant in Tongling to 700 tons per day.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will acquire Jinlong's existing captive plants. Jinlong has also been utilizing Praxair's oxy-fuel burner applications technology to further improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.</p>
          <p>New project activity for the region remains strong. We have not seen any weakening in the negotiation and bidding process for new project activity. In fact, in a couple of instances, given the government changeover, a couple of bids have accelerated with the customer indicating they plan to make a decision quickly. The growth continues to be driven by longer-term secular growth needs and includes energy, chemicals, metals and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page 10. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $162 million, up 3%, compared to the prior year excluding currency. The underlying sales growth came primarily from higher price as increased energy and aerospace coatings were offset by weaker industrial coatings primarily in Europe.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $28 million for the quarter, and the increase reflects price and productivity gains.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to page 11 for our earnings guidance. Our earnings guidance for the first quarter is for EPS of $1.35 to $1.40. Typically, our first quarter is the softest of the calendar year due to seasonal slowdown through the holidays in South America and Asia, and slow winter sales in the U.S. construction market.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for the full year of 2013 is for sales to be in the area of $12 billion, roughly 7% above 2012. Our initial forecast for full year earnings per share is a range of $5.85 to $6.10, which represents an increase of 5% to 10% above our 2012 earnings. This guidance assumes a currency headwind of about $0.04 a share at current rates from foreign currency translations, the majority of which would occur in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Pension is a headwind of about $0.05 per share for the year given the lower discount rates in effect on the reevaluation as well as loss amortizations. Interest expense will increase due to higher debt levels that are now substantially termed out. This is estimated to be a headwind of about $0.05 per share.</p>
          <p>We expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. About 20% of this spend is maintenance capital for our base business. We spent another 5% for cost reduction projects, such as improving the energy efficiency of our plants by upgrading compression equipment or turbomachinery. We will typically look for a three-year payback on these projects. The remaining 75% of our capital spend or approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion is for new production plants under contracts with customers which will deliver sales and earnings growth for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&amp;A. Please limit yourself to one question, and if needed a quick follow-up question for clarifications. That way more people can get a chance to ask a question.</p>

          <p>Good morning. This is Rob Walker on for Laurence.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Jim, can you go into a bit more detail on the rebound you're seeing in activity in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think that you can see that in several areas. The most important one in my mind is really the pace of decision making and the pace of moving forward on projects. We saw generally during the second and third quarters of 2012 kind of brought a pause in decision-making as people were waiting for the party members to get chosen and so forth. That in turn slowed down capital spending and now we've seen that improve. So, we're seeing much quicker decision-making in terms of new project proposals and we're also seeing additional strengthening demand in merchant gases and onsite gases, particularly December and the first couple weeks in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then, can you update us on where merchant utilization rates are by region and how those &#x2013; whether they are up or not, sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really go through them all by region. But I would tell you that utilization rates, generally speaking, are sequentially off in Europe. They were lower in the U.S. They're lower &#x2013; and in Asia, actually they're up slightly. But generally, they're not as strong as we would like them to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley. You may proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. If I take a look at the backlog, guys, about $1 billion of the $2.6 billion is in Asia. Does it concern you, Jim, that that backlog is a little unbalanced in terms of a risk assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a big number. The &#x2013; and I would be concerned if it was all in one country. But it's pretty evenly split between Korea, India, and China. There's also some projects in the Middle East and Thailand there. But we've got large backlog in Korea mostly related to three projects that we're building for Samsung right now in their core Korean operations, which incidentally have continued to operate very well because Samsung does a mix of their own in-house manufacturing as well as outsourced manufacturing. When their volumes go down, they pull the outsourced manufacturing back in-house and that's actually improved our business. That's why our electronics business held up quite well during the quarter.</p>
          <p>India, we've got a couple of steel projects, refinery projects, and then a bunch of, kind of variety of manufacturing and mining, metals and so forth. So, it's pretty well balanced there. Then in China, we've got a couple large gasification projects underway. We don't have anything new in steel underway and so it's pretty well balanced, but it is a large amount of backlog for Asia. But that's really where the growth is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then secondly, one of your competitors talked about refinery hydrogen outage that they benefited from in the quarter. Was it you or another competitor that had some operating problems on the U.S. Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly wasn't us. It might have been <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:15) refinery. I'm not sure what they're talking about.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. You may proceed sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim. So your CapEx is up over 50% in the last two years. And if you look at it, I mean, you really don't have any free cash flow because of this high CapEx and your dividend payments. So when do shareholders begin to see free cash flow? Do we need to see loadings go up before we see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. But we are &#x2013; we really ended 2012 in a steep level of capital spending, almost 20% of sales, and that's because we had a lot of backlog that got pretty nearly finished construction in 2012 and will start up in 2013. CapEx in 2013 will be probably a range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, more back down to the more like 15% of sales kind of number and I expect that it will stay at those levels going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, one of the problems we have is that we're just not performing very well this quarter. We're not operating on all cylinders. Our operating profit contribution in South America was $25 million lower than the prior year; it was about $100 million annualized. About 5% of our earnings per share disappeared with that. So, we've got to get business from South America and Europe performing better. We've got to get these refinery projects. Well, that will be starting up for Valero and Motiva in the second quarter. And then the $1 billion of projects that Mark and I were talking about in Asia will be starting up in 2012 as well &#x2013; or 2013, I should say.</p>
          <p>But we clearly should be on track to be generating positive operating cash flow &#x2013; or stronger positive operating cash flow. But we will continue to increase the dividends and buy back stock because we also have an opportunity now with very, very low interest rates to take on a little bit more leverage and give our shareholders some of the benefit of our low borrowing cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just quickly, I think you're guiding to EPS growth of 5% to 10% this year. Your project backlog, you say, will contribute 4% to 6% of that. And plus, you are buying back stock. It feels like you're not giving much credit to your base business. Are you being conservative on that growth target?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean if you look at our EPS guidance, the bottom of the range essentially assumes no new contribution out of the base business; in other words, a completely flat base business in 2013. The pickup from $5.57 to $5.85, that $0.30 or so, is all coming from new projects, partially offset by about $0.10 of &#x2013; or maybe $0.05 of headwind from pension, another $0.05 from higher interest expense, and another $0.05 from currency.</p>
          <p>So, the bottom of the range is no growth in the base business, no improvement in the economy and then I think the top end of the range shows what I'm hoping to see beginning in March which is a pickup in packaged gas demand in the U.S. and a pickup in some of the oil well services activity, pickup in South America, and a pickup in Europe. So hopefully, we'll get up there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, the bullishness on Latin America, well-founded medium and long-term. Can you kind of talk about how long is the short-term and what we should expect macro-wise for your business there over the next two to three to four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I knew. I've been wrong the last couple of quarters, but it seems like Brazil is going through kind of a one-two-three-four punch starting out with their own strong currency and high interest rates. That should have bounced back, but then I think they were hit in the middle of this year by weakening demand from China for raw materials and then they've been hit in the fourth quarter by power rationing and decreased power availability.</p>
          <p>Now, one of the things that we're expecting to happen in Brazil, well, there're quite a few government stimulus programs underway in terms of lower interest rates and taxes on imported goods. But they also have plans to reduce taxes on electric power and that's one of the Achilles heels for the Brazil producers right now as electric power in Brazil costs easily probably 2.5 times what it costs in the United States.</p>
          <p>Those tariffs are supposed to come down in February and I personally believe that one of the reasons that December and January were so weak is that people are waiting to have lower power costs start up again. So, knock on wood, and hope that we get into the second quarter and we'll get a much better contribution out of Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, if we look to the U.S., you guys got a very interesting view of the big chemical build-out that people are talking about, both in supplying some product to these big plants and also in that you've done a lot of construction yourselves in the U.S. where others really haven't over the last several years. When you think about kind of the announced buildout that people have talked about going out into 2017, 2018, and 2019, how probable is it that you think the chemical industry can build out on the schedule that it's projecting itself? And then, what's your opportunity around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are some roughly 10 or so projects that I think are &#x2013; probably 20 projects are still in the drawing board, maybe 10 of which will end up getting built. I'm not going to start giving odds on particular projects right now. But I can tell you that the construction economics, construction scheduling, construction execution on the Gulf Coast is better than anywhere else in the world. We have consistently been able to build our projects on budget, on schedule. I can tell you that if you try to build a large chemical plant in the Gulf Coast as compared to Europe or South America, your capital spending is probably going to be half as much as other parts of the world. And that's because of high skilled labor availability, good labor productivity, and so forth. So, I think that the Gulf Coast is in good shape for the size availability, projects going on budget and on schedule.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Europe, at the beginning, it sounds like it is stabilizing a little bit, maybe steady, I guess, to some degree at weak levels, and the competitors over there were a little bit aggressive at the beginning of the downturn. Have things sort of normalized there in a competitive environment? It looks like pricing was positive, or are we back to a little bit more normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, there's lot of different parts in Europe, but I would say that in Southern Europe, obviously, we've been hit for multiple years now by the constant fiscal issues. Germany kind of was very strong for a couple of years and then finally slowed down in the second half. And I would largely attribute that to lower exports of machinery in China and other countries, which was kind of on the same thing that I was talking about before. But what we're expecting in 2013 is definitely some improvement in Southern Europe and that's mainly because during 2011 and 2012, the government spending has tightened up and that was an additional fiscal drag on industrial production growth. And then now that's over, they've reached their targets, Spain has reached its targets, Italy has reached its targets in terms of austerity. And so spending should be able to pick up a little bit in 2013, and I think that if China starts to order more equipment and so forth that Germany could get a lift also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And one quick one on PDI, is the expectation to potentially see that business get back to maybe mid-single digits in terms of growth? And do you still see acquisitions in that area in 2013 as a good way to use &#x2013; utilize your cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, we are kind of an open window in 2012 for acquisitions, in the sense that most of these acquisitions or pretty all of them are family-owned businesses. And as I've said before, their decision to sell is usually a family decision. Now, businesses were strong in 2012, and people were concerned about capital gains taxes going up. And so, a lot of people came to us, and especially in the fourth quarter, ready to sell.</p>
          <p>And so, we closed those acquisitions. I would expect that the pace of acquisitions will slow down because that kind of window is over. In terms of the underlying business, I think you got some government contractors and so forth who are unsure what kind of inventories they should be carrying. So, the biggest downturn that we've seen in December and January has been in hard goods and equipment spending.</p>
          <p>And I think that the U.S. industrial renaissance concept is still alive and well. We've talked about the refinery build-outs or the chemical plant build-outs in the Gulf Coast. That should be &#x2013; auger well for welding and equipment spending, packaged gases, and so forth. So, I think it will get back on track as the year progresses.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the decline in the fourth quarter, how was that spread out between the packaged gases and you also mentioned, merchant and fracking as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, most of it was in packaged gases. I think what I was trying to convey is that, sometimes we've seen yearend production curtailments with onsite customers. We did not see that in either the steel, the chemical, or the refinery industry this year. So, it was mostly packaged gas and manufacturing. We've seen some slowdown in natural gas fracking, and I'm not sure exactly when &#x2013; what to expect there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, if you just try and take a closer look at our income statement, we typically have what we call other income of $5 million to $10 million a quarter. It was negative this quarter and we did have to &#x2013; we did take advantage of the quarter to take out some write-downs in South America. And we also have fairly significant severance cost this quarter as we do most quarters. And then the other thing that was hurting other income was slightly lower partnership income from one of our fracking joint ventures.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Jim, just want to get a little more color on your outlook. So, you had 2% growth in volume overall in 2012, obviously down from 2010 and 2011. So what's behind your 2013 outlook? Where do you see that volume going? And can you just be a little more specific on how PDI did in the fourth quarter between gases and rent and hard goods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, let me start with PDI and basically, PDI results for the quarter were relatively flat year-on-year. But the last December was down 7% in hard goods, for example. So basically, what we're seeing is volumes are up overall in the fourth quarter, but really all in December. And we're still seeing good price achievement both in gases and rent, but hard goods is where we took a hit. Now the other question was about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about your overall volume expectation for the company. So, you're up 2%, which &#x2013; in 2012, which really slowed down, I guess, from 5% in 2011, 9% in 2010, so what &#x2013; is it just kind of muddle along at that level? Do you see any &#x2013; are you baking in any sort of volume &#x2013; significant volume recovery beyond what you saw in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I said about the guidance was that the bottom end of the guidance assumes really no contribution from underlying volumes in terms of industrial production pretty much globally. We should get roughly 6% from project startups across the year. And then you could potentially get back to 8% to 10% if we get some help from the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then on that 4% to 6% top-line contribution from new projects, what does that translate into in terms of earnings per share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be slightly higher than that because the new projects have higher operating margins. For the most part they are onsite projects with high operating margins and will contribute more to operating profit than they do to sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, and good morning or afternoon, everyone. Just one last follow-up on sort of what's baked in versus what has been happening, in particular to packaged gas. I just want to make sure I understand. How much of December, and I guess now January weakness just becomes lost versus how much of it do you think can snap back later in the year, and what's baked into that 5% to 10% EPS growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think that the time lost is lost, okay. In other words, weak volumes in December and January, I don't think that we'll get a payback for those volumes in February if that's the way the question is oriented. So, I think that there's just &#x2013; I just don't think we'll see that come back. So, that just put a dent in the last month of 2012 and the first month of 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Just wondering given that you'd seen good results in terms of pricing in the face of a pretty lackluster demand environment, I'm just wondering, Jim, if you could talk about your outlook for 2013 pricing even if we do get a relatively flattish volume condition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well I mean we generally, historically have gotten on the average about 2% per year price in merchant and packaged business. Now that's all kind of a long-term average, not &#x2013; a whole lot different than inflation, but a pretty good number when you compare it to generally what you see in other basic materials sectors where pricing tends to come down over time.</p>
          <p>So, we're pretty positive about the outlook. We have contracts in merchant package which enable us to pass on price increases. And certainly, we have to be able to get productivity and price increases which more than offset our inflation. And generally speaking, our team is able to do that. We have issues around the world like the fall in argon prices in China, which we were not able to recover, and then the weak economies in Europe and South America. But I think with a little bit of economic stability, we'll be able to get &#x2013; reach our goals in pricing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Jim, just tying your last answer to the Jan 1 price increase of, I guess, 15% for LOX, LIN and as much as 30% for helium. I know you don't get nearly all of that and there is a &#x2013; it comes on a bit of a waterfall. But should this imply a little bit more than the annual 2% type price increase, at least for North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, the way pricing works in the merchant business is that most of the customers are on contracts probably an average of five years. And there are variety types of contracts depending on what the customers' interest is. But in a lot of cases, we've got some customers who are on old contracts that are four years old, let's say, that come up for renewal this year and haven't seen a price increase in nearly five years. And so, the announcement that we put out is really more focused on customers that are situated like that. And it's not meant that we will get that kind of a price increase across our system.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And just, Jim, one more thing, just on the 17 North American packaged gas acquisitions, how much sales did you acquire and what was the average EBITDA multiple you paid?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends on the specific property, but we're pretty much focused on acquisitions where we've already got the existing operations and we can get some good synergies. So, I would say generally &#x2013; I imagine a rule of thumb that we would be paying somewhere in the order of 10 times the EBITDA pre-synergies, and then after we've gotten the synergies, we'll get, after synergies, something like six times EBITDA.</p>

          <p>Jim, you talked about the incremental earnings from your new projects. And I'm just curious given a relatively somber outlook for the base business, do most of these projects &#x2013; those on-sites have piggybacks that would have a slower ramp to that extra liquid volume or is there any reason to expect that the ramps of these new projects would be slower than typical given a weaker economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a fair amount of doubt. It depends on the project. Some of the projects are &#x2013; especially the refinery hydrogen projects are 100% take-or-pay. Other are the projects, have piggyback liquid projects for liquid oxygen, hydrogen and argon. And usually, we try to be fairly conservative in our expectations for both the volume ramp-up and the price of new capacity there.</p>
          <p>I would say that one of the slower parts of 2012 that we didn't get as much contribution as we would have liked to was some of the Chinese projects where we had some liquid argon projects, and as we've talked before, the price of liquid argon came down significantly.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And another sort of second-tier gas is helium. And I guess I've seen different views on whether the helium supply issue is being resolved or not, and then we see some unrest in Algeria, which tends to be a good source or was expected to be a good source of extra helium. Are you guys running into problems in your PDI business with helium availability and what's pricing doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We have enough helium to go around to all of our customers at this point in time. But we don't have any more than that, okay. And so, the one issue with helium is there's only a few places in the world where helium is found. And that's even found in conjunction with certain natural gas wells in the Midwest and also in Russia, and interestingly in Algeria.</p>
          <p>We don't source much from Algeria, so we're not really concerned about that issue. I don't think it would be an issue anyway, but clearly, there are limitations on supply. We, as well as others in the industry, are trying to find some more sources of supply. We're quite well backward-integrated and so I think we have the most robust and flexible supply system than anybody in the industry, and that's why we're the only ones who does not have people who are &#x2013; allocations are reduced at this point in time. But I think that supply will be tight from 2013 and the best way to allocate that is to keep some pressure on pricing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. In your Asian business, sequentially, your revenues, I think, were up $16 million and your operating profits were up $17 million. How did you do that? And &#x2013; or was there something unusual that happened in Asia this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple things, and part of it's seasonal, but we've had two significant plant startups in Asia in &#x2013; started up really at the end of the &#x2013; in the third quarter. And then we also have typically some power issues in Asia in the third quarter, and so that overall is the result that we achieved.</p>
          <p>We also had some makeup, minimum take-or-pay payments that came through in the fourth quarter that pertained to earlier in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. And in answer to a previous questioner who was asking you about other income, you reflected that other income was sort of unusually low for this quarter and that it was roughly $40 million for the year. Is that something you expect for 2013? Is the other income number something like $40 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably not that high. I mean it depends on whether you have any asset sales and so forth. But we generally get partnership income through that line and several other categories of income. And then when we have severance charges and so forth, they come through that line. So, you have kind of unusual things. But absent any restructuring charges or major asset sale gains, that's typically around $5 million a quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. I promise I didn't have my mute on. I'm not sure what that was. My question relates to refinery hydrogen in North America. Specifically, I'm wondering if your three- to five-year view of growth prospects there has changed at all as a function of what's going on with the crude oil slate and the impact that shale oil discoveries have had in the U.S.? You hosted a very helpful event in mid-2011 where you outlined some fairly specific goals there. And I'm just wondering if there's been any evolution of the growth view over the last year-and-a-half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that over the past year-and-a-half that as the U.S. has proved that it can be more self-sufficient in oil, what you've seen is that U.S. production of light sweet crude has substantially grown as well as natural gas liquids, which means that the reliance on heavy sour crude that we had forecasted several years ago is probably not going to pan out as much as we would have guessed several years ago. That then in turn means probably fewer new hydrogen projects for U.S. refiners.</p>
          <p>So, we're really &#x2013; we've got some under way. The ones that we've got are in good shape, but I'm not expecting that we'll see the same level of refinery investments in order to be able to have a more flexible slate of crude to refine.</p>
          <p>Now, so we're focused more overseas with some projects in India and other locations where refinery capacity needs to be added just to meet growing demand for motor fuels and not being added specifically to refine heavy sour crude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up, Jim. I think at the time back in 2011, you were looking for about 8 billion standard cubic feet a day of growth, and of that amount, maybe 5 billion was going to be outsourced and Praxair was looking to capture about a third of that or 1.7 billion. Even if the market is slowing &#x2013; is the amount of outsourcing similar and is your win rate similar to your prior goals in terms of the projects that you're capturing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the total market is definitely going to be smaller than the outlook we've had there. In terms of the outsourcing, if anything, I would say that the tendency among refiners who wants to outsource is growing. We're clearly seeing that in India and a number of other countries where in prior times, they had done it in-house and now they're going to outsource it. So, I think that part of the equation is still very solid.</p>
