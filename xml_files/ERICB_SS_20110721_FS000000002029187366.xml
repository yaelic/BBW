          <p>Welcome to the Ericsson's analysts and media conference call for their first quarter report. To view visual aids for this call, please log on to www.Ericsson.com/press, or www.Ericsson.com/investors. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As reminder, replay will be available one hour after today's conference.</p>
          <p>Ase Lindskog will now open the call.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator, and hello, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. Today we will comment on our second quarter report and also take questions as always. And with me here today I have Hans Vestberg, our President and CEO. I have also Jan Frykhammar, Chief Financial Officer, and Johan Wibergh,who is head of our Business Units and Networks and Magnus Mandersson, our head of Business Unit Global Services.</p>
          <p>As always, then, I have to remind you that during the call today we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to impact as mentioned today's press release and discussed in this conference call. We also encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report as well as in our annual report.</p>
          <p>So with this introduction, then, I would like to hand over to our President and CEO, Hans Vestberg for comments about our performance and plans going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Ase. I will briefly go through the second quarter, but I will just start with a couple of highlights from the second quarter, what has been things that are happening in the industry and for us as well. I think that starting with the tier pricing or quality service pricing on broadband, especially mobile broadband is on the top of the agenda of our customers, and I think that is important to understand that many operators are looking to that in order to capture a larger portion of the mobile broadband world, and also serve both low end mobile broadband users to high end and enterprises, and therefore tiered pricing is important.</p>
          <p>So, why is that important for us? I guess that trend is very important for us when we come <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:43) area, when it comes to how to design the radio networks, the IP networks in order to capture, and being able to have tier pricing in the multimedia segment, very much the OSS/BSS, what needs to be done in those areas in order to capture the mobile broadband growth and the charging of it. And of course finally service capabilities needs to be tuned in to that as well.</p>
          <p>So this is a very important trend, and it's on top of the agenda of our customers. Of course, that is fueled from the mobile broadband continued to be the driving in the market. However, as we say here, when 60% of the world's population still remains to be covered by  WCDMA, HSPA/CDMA, and mobile broadband. And also, another thing that is looked for discussion in the market with our customers is LTE. Even though LTE today is a fraction of the subscribers, of the 5.7 billion mobile subscriptions ending in the second quarter, it's an important evolution, where 20 commercial networks launched on LTE, where Ericsson in part of the majority of them, and of course are into discussions in the lot of the regularly around the globe.</p>
          <p>The other area of course is the BSS/OSS, we outlined already in the capital market day that we see portfolio momentum in the business support system and the operating support systems. And we have a good portfolio there, with the prepaid, OSS in the networks business, but also other application, and now we have our intention is to go through the acquisition that we announced in the second quarter to add in Telcordia in order to us to be a leading position in OSS/BSS.</p>
          <p>Finally, patents has been on the lips in the industry this quarter. Of course Ericsson committed very much to patents, sitting on 27,000 patents that were generated in the history of Ericsson. A very solid and important piece as many new entrants are coming into this industry, and where sharing technology patents will be important. That was shown when the auction of the Nortel patents took place at the end of June where we together with other technology leaders in the industry, in a consortia, won that bid for the patents from Nortel. So it clearly shows that patents are important and playing an even more important role when we go into the networked society and everything is going to be connected. Okay. That was a little bit what we discussed with our customer recently and what is important.</p>
          <p>Let's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:24) the figures, we'll not dwell too much. Second quarter sales almost 55 billion Swedish kronas.  14% growth.  And if you adjust for currency and take away acquisitions, which is the main part is Korea, we have 27% growth in the quarter.  That I think is a good quarter, fueled of course from the mobile broadband.  We also see new markets coming up in this mix. We see strong growth in Brazil, China, Germany, Korea and Russia.  If we then talk about Japan, we were earlier out talking about the tragic event in Japan would have an impact on our business.  We had a limited impact on us.  And two reasons. One was the fast recovery of the Japanese population and how fast they came back to work, which is just fantastic. The second is a very good and frantic work of our supply chain that was early on redesigning, buying on the spot market which limited the impact in the quarter to see that our customer got as much fulfillment of their desire as possible in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Profitability, net income up 60%, or 59% to be exact, impact on improvement on core Ericsson.  However, increased losses on the joint ventures. If you don't take the  joint ventures, Sony Ericsson reported last week, Sony Ericsson had far bigger impact of the tragic event in Japan, in the quarter, and that had an impact on not being able to deliver 1.5 million phones in the quarter of a total of 7.6 million phones. That made them to a loss in the quarter after five consecutive quarters of profit.  70% of the phones are Android-based, as well as the new Experia portfolio is well received by the market. So I think that was a very clear reason for the loss for Sony Ericsson.</p>
          <p>ST however, as we talked about in the first quarter, as well as it was announced, the 23rd of June, by ST themselves, it is a totally changed marketplace when it comes to feature phones and smartphones, and the strength or the volume that Ericsson has had has of course been on the feature phones with certain customers, that are transitioning very quickly down on feature phones, which means that smartphones are not offsetting, even though ST-Ericsson has taken good design wins with more customers than we had -- than we previously -- when we engaged in this joint venture, it's not offsetting. That we saw in the second quarter with widening of the loss.  Where we now adding a new restructuring program in order to come back and have the right size for the company.</p>
          <p>We are of course committed to the ST-Ericsson. We think it's a very important asset for us.  We say also in the report that if these quick changes that we've seen in the last two quarters continue to worsen, then of course we need to look in to what that impact has for ST-Ericsson.  But right now with the plans we have and the best knowledge we have, we have a plan, and the assets that we have in ST-Ericsson is okay. But again if there's going to be a significant worsening, which we don't know today, that we'll reevaluate in that moment.</p>
          <p>That leads me to networks, and as I have Johan Wibergh here I ask Johan to go through the progress on the networks in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans. So the good speed we had in Q1 continued into Q2, and being fueled by mobile broadband as Hans said.  But also by a good increase of our IP network product.  And with that then I mean packet core as used for mobile networks, IP EDGE routers as well as IP-based transmission equipment.</p>
          <p>We also had a good development in China on GSM. In Korea where we had a really good developments since the acquisition with several good deals, as well as the continued strong performance of CDM in the U.S..</p>
          <p>So we then had a 31% up year over year, despite the FX headwind we have due to the strong Swedish currency.</p>
          <p>When it comes then to the geographical mix, we had a shift.  Seeing more countries now taking uptake from mobile broadband, so we could see then growth coming in Latin America, strong performance in Northern Europe and Central Asia. And also in part of Asia as well as in Mediterranean, we had a somewhat slower quarter than in North America and Japan.</p>
          <p>Margins then continued fairly strong, but were impacted on the restructuring costs that we took out from the Swedish operations, as well as some markets.  You should also remember then in Q1 that we had a one-time patent sale, all for the same, and we had more or less of an equal profit development.</p>
          <p>Back to the Japan situation, then, as we said in the beginning of Q2, that we expected a bigger impact. I'm very happy with the work that we did and we came out with much better than we expected and we had a very high speed of production in June.</p>
          <p>Overall then we have seen that we have continued to take market share, and that has been a very good development, and we also see that we're taking more deals, modernization deals in Europe, which is very good then overall for our market position, but of course also then will have an impact on profitability.</p>
          <p>Just a few words about this modernization project, since we get questions on how they work.  And a modernization project is typically where a operator selects a vendor of technology, for the coming  7-10 years typically, and usually then the modernization project starts with something like 12 to 24  months of a replacement cycle where you go in and replace the old technology with a more modern technology.  And the modern technology then usually don't have full cost coverage for that initial phase, but then when that is in place, you then reap the benefits over the coming years with expansion, both hardware and software as well as additional capacity and coverage.</p>
          <p>Also then, during this 12 to 24 months, depending then on the operator, really you should then have less of expansions on the old technology since that is really just replacement.</p>
          <p>I think with that I hand back to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you Johan. Then we go to global services.  Magnus Mandersson will present that. Magnus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans. Let's talk a little bit about Global Services.</p>
          <p>So we ended the quarter with SEK 19 billion in sales; we had a currency effect about 12% over the quarter.  Our year on year sales is then down 5%.  And sequentially we are up 9% over the quarters.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing flattish sales on Professional Services.  However, the earnings is about the same level as last year, the same period. If we take out the restructuring charges as we know. even out on the results.</p>
          <p>We have actually had an quite good quarter when it comes to order intake, signing on new contracts in Managed Services.  We have taken in over 24 contracts, whereas 9 of these are extension and expansions. This is almost a double compared to a year back.  If you remember the 2010 full year results was 56 contracts and 26 renewals. So of course it's heavy intake of new contracts.</p>
          <p>Then, we're also seeing the systems integration taking off. A lot of new business in the area of OSS/OSS, data center transformations, and service delivery platforms to come in. This is, of course, the change of the total landscape in the <mark type="ph" /> IST (14:46) as mobile broadband is growing. A lot of these deals will of course come in &#x2013; sorry, a lot of this will happen more in the future as well.</p>
          <p>Then of course we have network roll-out.  Our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:00) services that has been hampered, or the higher sales but earnings is lower based on the supply situation we have had over the past 9 months, or three quarters.  As well as the Japan catastrophe. These results for us in services that we have, if only one product is short in the RE installation, we can't invoice the project.  So it's a lot of incomplete projects there.</p>
          <p>Then of course we have large roll-outs in India, that's also a big investment for us. That has taken a little bit of toll on the earnings.  And of course the modernization of the European <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:52).</p>
          <p>Overall, we have increased our professionals with up now to 50,000.  And we feel that we have a good readiness for the second half.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Magnus. Then go to the loss segments. Multimedia had minus 2% year over year of growth.  Of course, adjusting for currency, they would be in growth right now. What has come back is revenue management, which is good to see.  Which is an important piece, and the largest piece in the business. TV Solutions came down, especially on compression, and they can be nice and say there was a weak quarter and it was a very strong 2010, but we came down on compression.  EBITDA margin is improving definitely because of the cost initiatives we have initiated.  Here we are focusing not only on taking out costs, I think the most important is getting volumes.  We don't have a gross margin problem here, as I said before, it's more the volume to get results and now also when adding in Telcordia products over time here we're going to have a nice portfolio addressing OSS and BSS.</p>
          <p>Regional sales.  We have now 5 regions, growing, if you're nice you can include the currency effect, you're up to 6, 7, maybe up to 8 regions growing.  So we have a different pattern, and I want to point out there are two regions that are really down, that is Southeast Asia and Oceania, and sub-Sahara. And for their particular reasons they are down, which were commented before.  If you then look at the ones that are <mark type="ph" /> realistic to grow (17:35) right now, India, 107%.  Easy comparison.  We didn't sell that much last year but anyhow 3G is coming out there. China and Northeast Asia are definitely growing well.  96% up.  Korea, Japan, China 2G, all of it is going up so that's strong.</p>
          <p>And then we also have Northern Europe and Central Asia, that is up 70%.  Very much fueled by large projects, many of them being in Russia which is a large market.  Latin America up 17%, very much also Brazil there.</p>
          <p>So you see that we have a little bit mix because then comes North America, that has been the growth engine for the company the last two, three, quarters, and actually doubled its size in one year in 2010.  That means that we'll come to a very good position in North America.  We are the leader in services and infrastructure in telecommunication in North America in less than 18 months.  That I think is an impressive job in one of the most important telecoms markets around the world.  Now we have a negative growth in this quarter for the first time for a long time.  Of course, the currency has its toll, so it would be growth, but it's not the same growth rate as before.  So we see a somewhat slower networks business quarter over quarter here, and the reason is of course we are very strong with this customer, and as with any customer they look in the investment in different type of quarters here.  So I think that we've established ourselves on a very high level in North America and we will take that benefit.  We can see that the service portfolio is now also starting to get a lot of good tractions in North America.  So still North America is an extremely important market for us.</p>
          <p>Good. I hand over to Jan Frykhammar to talk a little bit about the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you, Hans.  And so we go to profitability and focusing the first slide then on gross margins. Gross margins in the quarter ended at 37.8%.  That is slightly down sequentially.  And down from 39% last year.  Of course, like all our numbers, this year restructuring charges are included in numbers and last year they were excluded in numbers. And I think if you look at this margin slide here, we should remember that when we look at the years 2008, '09 and '10.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we started to see in the quarter a bit of change in business mix.  More, as Johan and Magnus mentioned here, more coverage buildouts, more modernization projects, and we started to get in the quarter was a little bit of an impact of modernization projects.  It was very slow in the first quarter.  We believe then for second half of this year that network modernization projects will continue to be a bigger portion of our sales and margins.</p>
          <p>If we look at the year over year comparisons, positive one is that we have a lower share of services, which is impacting the gross margin in a year over year perspective. The negative ones are of course the 3G rollouts in India, some modernization projects, but also some of the under absorption in the service organization related to supply challenges. Quarter over quarter, it is more of a change of the business mix or product mix that we start to see impacting the margins a little bit.</p>
          <p>If we take next slide and look at operating expenses, SEK 15.8 billion during the quarter. R&amp;D, continued to increase and that is exactly in accordance with our plan.  The investment areas that we focus on extra this year is as we have said before, it's to make sure we have a strong position in LTE and TDLT, and we continued to spend our efforts on IP and the new IP portfolio, and then as well we have the impact of the acquired LG-Ericsson operation.</p>
          <p>If we look at SG&amp;A in the quarter, at SEK 7.7 billion, here we have a one-time hit of restructuring charge in Sweden, I'll come back to that.  But that's the main reason for the increase. And then if we then look at the full year, we confirm our range and our R&amp;D guidance for the full year, which is --  we believe will be between SEK 31 billion up to SEK 33 billion.</p>
          <p>If we take then the operating margin, excluding joint ventures, 9.2%, as reported, that is compared to 11.1% last year.  We included structuring charges this year and excluded them last year.  So underlying it is an improvement, if we compare like for  like.</p>
          <p>If we then take the restructuring charge, this program that we announced in Sweden had a higher uptake than what we anticipated.  And we believe that -- and it was really the voluntary redundancy offers in combination with early retirements that explains that the program became slightly more expensive, but also the fact that it was more successful in terms of number of employees. We will -- we decided to take this investment because we see that there is a good payback here  of two and a half years. We will start to see impacts of run rate reductions during Q3 but full impacts on the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>If we then take the balance sheet, we have a decent progress in terms of days of sales outstanding and payable days. Where we are going to spend our and effort focus during the second half is to get the inventory more balanced.  And you can see that that's the measurement here on the balance sheet ratios that are off track.</p>
          <p>It is in accordance with our strategy to mitigate the impact of the Japan situation.  It's also because we are still building production capacity for mainly RBS 6000, or multi-standard radio, but it's also a result of higher business activity or project activity, and you can see that if you read in the report, because we're disclosing inventory per regions, and you can then net out, and see what's remaining in the segments I mentioned.</p>
          <p>If we take the next slide, then we have changes in gross cash.  Recovered from an operating cash flow point of view this quarter we had plus SEK 5.8 billion, adjusted for restructuring outlays SEK 7 billion. Net cash, however, was anyway negative in the quarter and that is because the payout of dividends.  We ended up with a net cash positive of SEK 42.6 billion.</p>
          <p>With that Hans, I hand back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Quickly summarizing, our target remains, of course, we have our four targets on long-term ambition that then come down to the plan that we presented at Capital Market Day. Grow faster than markets. I think we have proven this quarter that we once again had a very solid growth of 27%. Best-in-class  volumes, we continue to do improvements on the bottom line; we will continue to do so.  Cash conversion, so far after six months we're not on 70% but it's our clear commitment and target to get there. And our JV earnings are not going in the right direction as we're widening the loss on that.  So that indicates a little bit where we are putting the focus as well.</p>
          <p>So by that, I hand back to Ase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I would like to ask you some more for clarity on your patents. The patents, also you mentioned it on the call today.  Are there major handset vendors who are not paying royalties to Ericsson at the moment, or who do you think might not be paying enough royalties? We know that you have a litigation ongoing with GTE. Could there be other litigation coming in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that you have spotted it. There are some that are not paying us, and we are try, of course in an amicable way, to get the settlement. With the ones that we are not getting that settlement we are unfortunately, need to go to these type of litigations.  I think there are not that many.  I think the main part of the mobile handset vendors are part of our sort of licensing.  However, you have to see that we have 27,000 patents, and the main part is on wireless, and that's also where we have the most cross-licenses. But we have also other patents that we need to look in to what we can do with them, and that we will pursue going forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, another question on IPR.  Hans, I'd like to explore the company's motivation for participating in the Nortel IPR auction, and if you had to characterize it, was the motivation more about keeping IPR out of the hands of other infrastructure or other device players or was it more a worry about patent stacking driving LTE device costs higher which would possibly slow the roll-out of LTE infrastructure?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matthew.  I think it was more a twofolded strategy. One of course is, as you mentioned, a defensive one to see that the patents -- because this industry is built on having people being interested in the industry and we can use our patents, and we think that is important. And I think that was from a defensive point of view to see that it ends up in the right hands. But we also saw a value in them, and that's why we had a consortium where we participated that won this deal, and that would work on that.  And I cannot say much more about it right now, because consortia will be founded, and the patents will be transferred, and that will happen during third quarter, and then the consortium will make the statements. I mean, we are one stakeholder so we cannot really comment as one stakeholder right now.  So we'll come back and talk a little bit more on the strategies for that consortium.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I had a question about North America, the trend in the U.S.  So revenues declined sequentially, but promptly speaking it is not consistent with numbers reported earlier today by AT&amp;T.  And I was wondering maybe you're losing market share or is it a matter of timing?  Anything you can comment on, it would be real helpful.  Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question.  And I think you almost answered it yourself. I mean, there is a difference when an operating spend and a CapEx and we have revenues. That can be everything from 3 months to 9 months, depending when they activate and when they do the investment.  So, and it can also be whatever is including in CapEx can be a lot of <mark type="ph" /> capacity (30:39) we are not addressing.  So one needs to understand even more when you draw a conclusion of a CapEx guidance from a customer.  We are not losing market share in North America.  I think that's the most important to say.  We are well positioned on the large operators. We have created, I would say, a fantastic position in North America, and we are continuing doing that and working with our key partners there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, and maybe either for Jan or for Magnus.  One of the big disappointments for the past, I don't know, three or four quarters now has been the Services business, which has been -- you've been talking about for some time, and it's gone from a quarter of sales in 2008 to over 35% now.  But the absolute run rate of profits from that business hasn't changed from about 6 billion or 7 billion krona. I guess my question for Jan or for Magnus is when might we see some leverage in this business, especially as it continues to drive up head count, and what's the prospect of the Services business over time returning to the double-digit operating margin we saw in '08, '09 timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Richard, I'll take that question. I think first of all if you go through some of the details in the report here, you can look at the Services business, the Professional Services business, which is holding up well.  And what we have seen for two quarters is a more challenging situation for the network roll-out business.  Overall, the reasons for that Magnus has highlighted very clearly in his presentation here.</p>
          <p>The head count increase in this business is either business driven, meaning that it's managed service contract, or capability driven meaning for instance that we build capabilities, for example in our Global Service Center in India or in Romania, and so forth. So of course we keep very good track of the head count, and we try to make sure that we all the time work on efficiencies there.</p>
          <p>So I think the issue area is to turn the network roll-out business around. The other businesses is doing fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when might we see that happen, given the comments you've made about inventory buildup and some of the projects in various emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we -- I think that if you look at the network roll-out business, there are certain areas in that business that should recover with supply recovery, and that is the comment Magnus made around the under absorption in some of the projects.  When it comes to the modernization aspect, that is, as Johan mentioned, a long-term business. Having said that, if you have a modernization contract that lasts for say, 18 to 24 months, you also have an opportunity to gradually improve that, both by means of being more efficient in the project as well as sourcing. So a gradual improvement is probably a good bet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much.  I just wanted to have a little bit more information around where you think you're gaining share in IP.  So I mean it's been brought up a couple times today around the EDGE and maybe around the mobile backhaul. If you could give me a little bit of color around where you're seeing that in terms of globally, regionally, and certainly with which sort of tier carriers? Is it Tier I or is it sort of lower down?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The areas that are going really well is several parts related to the IP portfolio. And today a big part of our portfolio has become <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:03) The things I specifically referred to when I talked here was, first of all, the transmission products, which could be both IP-based microwave or IP-based optical transmission, that is doing fine.</p>
          <p>Also on the EDGE router, where we are specifically strong on something that is called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:27) that's used on fixed Internet connections.  We have some Tier I customers on that, but we're also starting to gain in volume with other customers. And we're also providing IP EDGE routers to mobile operators as a backbone network for 2G and 3G data traffic.</p>
          <p>The final then, packet core. We're doing well in packet core when it comes to 3G and 4G networks.  When we step in and take a radio deal on LTE we will to a very large extent also take the deal on packet core.  And around these products you have something called policy control and we do something called Smart pipe, that enables you to have a very good differentiated quality service that you can charge differently on. We are very strong in that area also. So overall we're gaining.</p>
          <p>In Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced a new generation of technology. It's called the SSR, the smart services router.  That start shipping end of the year.  And that has also gotten a strong reception by customers.</p>
          <p>So I'm encouraged by the development we're doing. In some of these areas we are very strong, in other areas we have been weaker, and we are gaining in those.  I think we still have a lot to prove in this area.  But I am encouraged by the development during the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up to that, where do you think you need to invest the most in your portfolio of products right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where we are investing a lot is around that SSR and product.  It's a really product I'm extremely very proud of.  We have been having a drawback against Juniper and Cisco on capacity.  With that product we do not have that drawback.  We are on par with the most powerful EDGE routers that Cisco and Juniper have.  But on top of that we have a functionality to handle both fixed and mobile in the same product and neither Juniper nor Cisco has that functionality.  And I think that's where we are extremely strong, and we've been investing around that product and that portfolio now for some time.</p>
          <p>It brings the best together of Ericsson had on the mobile packet core side. Also prepared them for LTE.  And combining that with the fixed functionality of <mark type="ph" /> BRS (37:50) and other things.  So I think that's the area where we've been investing consistent now for a few years.  And that's what's in our bringing to the market with shipment starting late end of the year, and then next year is going to be interesting to see.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  In terms of North America, your weakness &#x2013; which is obviously your largest market, how much of your weakness there would you attribute to the weak economy in the U.S. versus say to the timing of revenue which you mentioned, versus maybe the competitive impact on prices? Just trying to get a feel for what the core demand is there, and is it mostly just the economy that's driving that, or are you seeing something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I heard you not perfect, but I guess your question was, is the less growth in North America, that way because we have growth if you currency adjust, is that attributed to the macro economic situation in North America?  If that was the question, I answer no, not to any significant means.  The underlying consumer demand is there.  New devices coming out all the time.  Apps is coming out, and that is what is driving the investment there for our customers.  But again, any operator in the world will go up and down in investment a little bit, depending on what they're doing at that moment.  And I think that's what we are seeing.  But again, remember, we have established ourself on a totally different volume in North America, where we are main supplier to all the large operators in North America and the U.S., so I think that is really a positive there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not a competitive effect. Mostly just the economy, or is it the currency, or is it just timing of revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The currency is one.  Of course, because I mean, in dollar invoicing we have a growth in North America in the quarter. So because they're down 6% in Swedish kronas and that would be different from the year before.  But there is no other changes that you're alluding to or macro economic that is impacting it or something like that.  We see a little bit less infrastructure sales, as we said, and that is of course coming from some operators have periodically doing less investment.  Nothing strange I think on this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then in LTE. I mean we've seen a big push for that in the U.S. through the CDMA carriers, and there's been some talk about it through the GSM carriers, but it seems that the roll-out is a bit more muted.  Certainly here.  Is this the trend in general? Are they holding off looking for maybe more growth before they get in to capacity?  What do you see is the overall trend based on LTE, based on technology? Is it mostly going to be CDMA push initially and then there is roll-out in GSM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that LTE is of course on top of many operators' minds as the next technology, and are in discussions or have decided.  But we all need to recognize it is still a smaller portion of the total market, both from an investment point of view and definitely from a subscriber point of view.  That doesn't mean that it's not important.  But it's of great importance for Ericsson to be the leader on LTE.  Because that's the next technology.  But from a volume point of view, and the subscriber point of view, it's still a fairly small portion of the total mobile infrastructure business.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I would just like to get back a little bit to gross margin dynamics.  If we look at your gross margin before the impact of restructuring, it was down only 70 basis points year on year, and 50 basis points quarter on quarter.  So it seems that most of this is down to the geographic mix with LatAm doing well, with India 3G.  So there's been some cost in terms of gross margin sequentially, I suppose.  But we haven't seen much of net modernization coming through.  So should we expect that to come on top of the emerging markets' mix in the second half of the year, so we should be more cautious in the gross margin going forward?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we said when we met in New York in May, I mean the most important to understand when it comes to gross margin development for us as a company is business mix.  And what we started to see in the quarter is a business mix that is gradually changing towards more and more of the emerging market.  In these markets, first of all, they are still building coverage and it's quite often as well have quite a big services scope, and that impacts the gross margin, at least initially, as we discussed a month ago.</p>
          <p>On the modernization projects, I think that for second half we will start to see some impact on the gross margin related to modernization projects.  And that is also what we highlight in the report.</p>
          <p>Though with the same statement as we made in the first quarter, that as a management team we work hard on trying to mitigate these impacts, both when it comes to learning curve in project execution, sourcing and other type of up selling activities.  But it is fair to say that we now have seen that the modernization element of the business in second half will be bigger than in the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  Just a follow-up to the previous question.  One of your comments on your statement is that the India 3G roll-out has hit a sort of temporary peak and could drop a bit.  Would that have a beneficial impact on margins in the second half of the year?  And will that compensate for some of the acceleration in the European modernization?</p>
          <p>And a second question, if I may, is how long would you expect this European modernization to last? You've said it's 18-24 months, but when do you see the modernization, the hardware part of that business beginning to drop off, and then the software upgrade part of that business beginning to come through?  Would that be something that we can expect, say, from the first half of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question there, when it comes to the revenue for India, second half, I mean I'm not guiding on that, but you know, as we said in the report, in this quarter we had first of all a quite easy, if I may say so, comparison compared to last year.  And we had a big deployment phase of 3G, whether that will happen in third quarter, let's come back to that then.</p>
          <p>I think on the modernization project, what we say is that in average these projects last probably between 18 to 24 months, from an initial case point of view, and if we now are stating, which we are, that these projects are -- have started to impact the business in the second quarter and will accelerate in the second half, then you have to look at a year and a half or so from the starting point.  So we will have an impact in it 2012 as well, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  I just wanted to ask from a longer term perspective.  Historically, emerging markets have been a lower margin business for Ericsson.  And as we go through the transitions to 3G, et cetera, ultimately should we anticipate that as emerging markets mature, that their margin structure will improve to come closer to that, that we see in the developed markets?  Or should we anticipate that your highest margin business will remain in the U.S. and Western Europe particularly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I need to disagree with your statement.  It's not the particular market or country that  is doing the best profitability. It's what Jan said here before, it's business mix, the type of business we're doing. If it's a greenfield roll-out, modernization, that's when we fight for the market share, that's the most competitive.  And then if you have upgrades or expansions, that is the same basically in all markets. Then you have decent prices.</p>
          <p>But I would say it's not about the markets here, or a certain country. It's about the business mix; where we are in the stage of a project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe another way to ask the question is, as you see the developing markets begin to have more mature networks and you see more of your business with them shift to software, and upgrades, then we should expect your margins will improve in those -- as a result of that in those markets?  Am I characterizing that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're basically stating what I said.  Yes, if they are in that phase, they will are a better profitability. So that's correct. Then there are many countries in the world and generalization on all of them is very difficult.  But your statement is absolutely right.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, my question is just a clarification, for Hans really. When you talk about the second half, everything that seems to be said today suggests that margins are going to go down frankly, whether it's a buildup in emerging markets in revenue recovery that you're seeing now as your Middle East, Africa.  I don't see any reason why that stops. It's going to actually recover probably even more given the under-investment for the last couple of years, combined with the fact of the European network modernization. So my question is, what are the positive drivers on margins the second half, if any, especially given that North America, as you say, is at decent high and elevated levels.  So I just don't see what the positive drivers are for, especially networking, I guess operating margins, I'm thinking.  Is anything positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. Of course, as Jan said before, we are working on a lot of mitigating factors.  That's our job, to keep up the margin and doing profit improvements.  I think that we have areas where we're doing cost efficiency work on. We have markets that is coming into another phase than they have been before.  So it's always going to be mitigating factors. Important for us that as we were so clear on the network modernization from the beginning, that we were aiming for growing market share in Europe.  We have done that.  But we also said that is going to be a competitive environment.  So that we were clear from the beginning in talking about that and we want to be transparent and tell you about that.</p>
          <p>That doesn't take away that this management team sitting around this table and the rest of the executives here are committed to work hard to find upsides mitigating factors.  But to single out one or two specifically, that I don't have. But of course we are committed to work with that.  But again, we were just very transparent on the network modernization which we think is an important piece of our cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess, Hans, that's the issue.  What are the mitigating factors? Because you've done a lot of restructuring in recent years. You're not doing that much &#x2013; I guess you are doing some that surprised you now, but then you also had the RB 6000 kind of renewal that probably helped as well. And you had North America that was very strong in CDMA <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:18) I'm just not sure what -- can you even give me one or two mitigating positive factors.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:23) working on, that Johan has worked on for a couple years, where the whole portfolio has <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:29) fewer platforms, hardware and software is coming in, so we have a lower cost base on the product coming out.  We are working long-term with our cost efficiency.  In Magnus's area, we're working with the transformation of offshoring all the time, not necessarily going to be any huge new restructuring, that we have done . And of course we're coming with a lower base all the time. So, we are working constantly in Services and in efforts on that, and in Multimedia where we've a program that's sort of in the work, and there we need volume.  So of course there are of course mitigating factors.  But so yes, we work daily on that. That's part of our work.</p>

          <p>One final thing just on China.  One of the things that's been clear is there's been quite a strong 2G upgrade cycle &#x2013; sorry, 2G strength, let's say I think starting last September, Q4, I think it really kicked in. Now what's the sustainability of that? I assume the GSM business in China is probably still very high margin. I'm wondering, are you expecting that to taper off or is that sustained strength just because of good sub's growth or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are look backwards of course it's a good demand on 2G and EDGE in China at the moment, from the consumers, and the consumers are growing there.  So we look forward and we see China still continuing to investment in GSM.  If it's going to be on these levels or not, that remains to be seen, but definitely we see a continuation on GSM for a while.</p>

What's going to define the mix of that, I would actually say is the consumer demand on the different type of technologies, and how our customers are deciding to launch.  And that we need to ask them for, because I cannot reveal what plans they have. So it's going to be a mix of consumer demand and the plans they have for launches of different markets, et cetera.  But currently we are rolling out mostly CDMA and LTE in the region right now.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my call.  I'd like to come back on the gross margin projection, if it's possible.  And particularly on the network modernization.  This is not new.  You've been flagging this for a while now, and certainly multiple quarters. We've met recently, this wasn't a big worry for you longer term.  I'm just trying to see if it's anything new happen recently to really flag this as a bigger threat to the gross margin profile, or is this something that you just wanted to repeat to make sure that we model it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we have said all along that this is an important investment for us in footprint and it's a long-term investment. This has not become any worse than what we originally anticipated. What we said in the first quarter was that the activity level on modernization project as such was perhaps a quarter or so delayed compared to what we originally anticipated.  Now we also report back saying that we have started more of these modernization projects, but that they will accelerate in the second half. So it's a little bit of a reminder.  Nothing else.</p>

          <p>Mark Sue (sic) [Hughes] (55:04) from RBC Capital Markets is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hans, recognizing LTE is small to date, does it feel as if the rate of commercial roll-out LTE can be further pushed out? Are carriers waiting for further consumer demand to expand the roll-out. I mean, the urgency seems to be dissipating.</p>
          <p>And then separately, another competitor, Nokia Siemens, seems to be rethinking their options after failing to find a buyer. With the price now even lower, would you be interested in further consolidation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the first one.  On the LTE, I think that what I've been surprised, and we can probably ask Johan to comment, is that LTE is coming earlier and HSPA is going further.  So I would say that we see a momentum on HSPA which will be prolonged because of the proliferation of drawbacks on HSPA and at the same time we see a big interest for LTE. If we look at Ericsson because that is probably what is more important, we will not see any significant revenues that impact the totality on LTE, until maybe 2013.  That's how we see it, so if that is giving you guidance.  That again is not saying that LTE is not important, because  R&amp;D is there and investing right now.  But the cycles as you remember are very long in this industry, before it turns into revenue.</p>
          <p>Before I comment on NSM, maybe Johan wants to comment something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think LTE is developing exactly as we thought, or even slightly quicker than we thought. We have just  passed 1 million subscribers on LTE, and we got there much quicker than we did on 3G.  I think a few years out in time we're going to realize then that LTE was a few years quicker to reach volume compared to 3G.  So it's going according to plan, one could not expect it to boom immediately, and everything here is really dependent on device availability. And I think if you looked at in the market, you will find that quite few devices are launched initially and then they become more and more, and it will pick up in speed.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased with the development n Ericsson, we continue to keep our strong market position in LTE.  That has gone quite well.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Operator, I think we can take one final question then before we end this Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for the question.  Really it's a question about growth.  I know you don't give growth guidance, but the sequential growth I thought in the second quarter was far below the type of seasonality we've seen historically in the business.  And obviously your year on year comparisons are flatted by the supply shortages of a year ago.  But it does feel like growth is slowing, and the cycle could be slowing a bit here.  Can you just help me understand why this isn't the point of peak growth for Ericsson?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you alluded to the sequential growth.  Or at least the historical one. Of course we need to remember the first quarter was very strong and we are on growth rates on the 27% currency adjusted right now which is fairly high.</p>
          <p>What we are aiming for, is of course to grow faster than the markets.  We have predicted the market out there, as you know, on infrastructure, somewhere between <mark type="ph" /> 3 to 5 years to come (58:36) and that's what we need to beat.  And I would say at the moment we're doing that.</p>
          <p>If it's a beat or not, let's see.  I think it's portfolio momentum in mobile broadband, it's portfolio momentum in Managed Services, it's portfolio momentum in OSS/BSS. We're number one on mobile broadband, number one on Managed Services, and we're building a very strong <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:59) with OSS/BSS. So I think we're doing the right thing for the company.  We're taking cost measures at the same time.  So I think this <mark type="ph" /> should pay (59:05) for the growth because this is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:09) the executive team has to grow and what the board has told us to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the weak sequential momentum is just a reflection of kind of volatility into the quarter rather than a change in trend, in your thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would include currency as one sort of factor, which is very important here.  We have several different factors in between the quarters.  And we are also mixed with between markets.  But I'm not predicting next quarter if it's going to be the same growth or not.  We are just hammering the model we have, and again we think there's portfolio momentum in this area, and we are well positioned.</p>
