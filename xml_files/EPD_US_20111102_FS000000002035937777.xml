          <p>Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dennis. And good morning all and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss third quarter results. Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner; followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO of General Partner Enterprise. There are other members of our senior management team also in attendance.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team.</p>
          <p>Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. First I'd like to like to recognize the hard work by our employees and maintaining a safe workplace. The third quarter of 2011 was Enterprise's best quarter ever for safety performance in our plant pipeline internal operations, with a total recordable incident rate of 0.52 for the quarter. We want to extend our personnel thanks to all of the Enterprise employees whose hard work and dedication to safety as a core value made this important milestone possible.</p>
          <p>Turning to our financial and operating performance, we're pleased to report record results again this quarter in terms of net income, adjusted EBITDA, gross operating margin, and distributable cash flow, surpassing the record results we set last quarter supported by growth in natural gas, NGL, and crude oil production in the shale regions as well as improved NGL sales margins. Our integrated system continues to operate at record or near record volumes.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the third quarter 2011 increased 20% to a record $973 million compared to $809 million for the third quarter of 2010. This led to record adjusted EBITDA of $956 million and record net income of $480 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our partnership generated record distributable cash flow of $856 million for the quarter, providing 1.7 times coverage of the increased cash distribution of $0.6125 per unit declared with respect to the quarter. Included in distributable cash flow this quarter was $190 million of net proceeds from the sale of 4.1 million energy transfer equity LP common units and the sale of our Alabama intrastate pipeline system.</p>
          <p>Excluding these proceeds our distribution coverage was still 1.3 times. We retained $341 million of distributable cash flow for the quarter and $833 million for the first nine months of the year, which represents 36% of the $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow we generated. This retained cash is being used to fund our growth capital projects and reduce our dependence on the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Our NGL pipelines and services segment reported gross operating margin of $548 million for the quarter, a 38% increase over the $397 million reported in the third quarter of last year. Included in gross operating margin this quarter is $3.7 million of proceeds from business interruption insurance.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business benefited from continued strong demand for NGLs as higher NGL sales margins and higher natural gas processing margins led to a $124 million increase in gross operating margin. Our Meeker gas plant operated near full capacity this quarter processing approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet a day of inlet gas volumes resulting in a 96% increase in fee-based processing volumes and a 7% increase in equity NGL production at Meeker.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that our Pioneer plant was down a few weeks last quarter for plant modifications to further improve its ethane recoveries. As a result Pioneer had an $18 million increase in gross operating margin for the third quarter as it benefited from higher equity NGL volumes and processing margins.</p>
          <p>Fee-based gas processing volumes increased 40% to 3.8 billion cubic feet a day for the third quarter of 2011 compared with 2.7 billion cubic feet a day for the third quarter of last year. Gross operating margin for our NGL pipelines and storage business increased $10 million to $146 million this quarter primarily due to increased long-haul transportation at higher tariff rates from the Mid-Americans and Seminole pipeline systems, which reported a $15 million increase in gross operating margin.</p>
          <p>Total NGL pipeline volumes decreased slightly to 2.2 million barrels per day this quarter compared to 2.3 million barrels per day for the third quarter of last year. We exported approximately 8 million barrels of propane this quarter, which is 12% less than the exports in the third quarter of 2010. A planned turnaround of our export turnover which was completed in July impacted our volumes early in the quarter. Since then liftings have returned to full capacity and we expect propane export volumes to be strong for the remainder of the year. In fact we are sold out for the remainder of this year and next year for propane exports.</p>
          <p>Our export facility expansion is proceeding on schedule to increase capacity by 50% to 10,000 barrels per hour by the end of next year. Shippers have executed 10 year shipper pay transportation agreements for the 50,000 barrels per day new capacity expansion of our Rocky Mountain leg of the Mid-America Pipeline System.</p>
          <p>Those shippers have until the end of this year to exercise options to increase their commitments to 85,000 barrels per day, which we expect will happen given the significant interest in new NGL takeaway capacity out of the Rockies.</p>
          <p>In the last few weeks, we've announced open seasons for the Texas Express NGL pipeline, which is a joint venture with Anadarko and Enbridge to move mixed NGLs in the Granite Wash and Barnett regions to Mont Belvieu. The Marcellus ethane pipeline with an initial capacity to move 125,000 barrels a day of ethane from the Marcellus and Utica regions to Mont Belvieu and our existing Skellytown NGL pipeline which currently moves 27,000 barrels a day of purity NGLs to Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>This morning we announced that we have secured long-term take-or-pay contracts for more than 75% of the initial capacity on the proposed Marcellus ethane pipeline. Ethane production from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays that ultimately have direct or indirect access to every ethylene plant in the U.S. through connections at Mont Belvieu and Jim will discuss these projects in more detail in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our NGL fractionation business reported gross operating margin of $54 million for the quarter, a 42% increase over the $38 million reported in the third quarter of last year. This increase was largely attributable to our new Frac 4 unit at Mont Belvieu which began commercial operations during the fourth quarter of last year, and is running in excess of its nameplate capacity of 75,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Our Norco and Hobbs fractionators also reported increase gross operating margin. Norco benefited from higher NGL sales margins and lower operating expenses and our Hobbs fractionator had increased volumes and higher average fees. Our fifth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu began commercial operations in October and immediately began operating in excess of its nameplate capacity of 75,000 barrels a day. The new unit increases total fractionation nameplate capacity of 380,000 barrels a day at Mont Belvieu. Supported by long-term contracts, the new fractionator will accommodate increased NGL production from domestic shale plays.</p>
          <p>With producers announcing more discoveries of shale plays with NGL rich natural gas reserves and petrochemical companies announcing more cracker conversions, expansions and newbuilds, we have started construction on a sixth fractionator at Mont Belvieu which is expected to be in service in early 2013. When this new facility is completed we will have approximately 460,000 barrels a day of gross NGL fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu and more than 940,000 barrels a day of gross NGL fractionation capacity system-wide.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services segment reported gross operating margin of a $156 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to a $154 million for the third quarter of last year. Gross operating margin from the Texas Intrastate system increased $15 million primarily as a result of higher firm capacity reservation fee revenues and increased interruptible transportation revenues.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the State Line Gathering System increased by $3 million primarily due to higher transportation volumes. We had a combined $10 million decrease in gross operating margin from the third quarter of last year on our San Juan and Jonah Gathering Systems due to higher operating expenses and lower volumes. Total Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline volumes increased 6% to 12.4 trillion BTU's per day for the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Our largest capital project to date is the Haynesville extension of our Acadian Gas Pipeline System in Louisiana. This $1.5 billion pipeline project is complete and began commercial operations yesterday. Initially, it was scheduled to begin operations on September 1, however, drilling and construction along the Atchafalaya River was delayed a little while flood waters from the Mississippi River receded.</p>
          <p>I would like to congratulate our employees and contractors for a job well done in completing this project as soon as possible and under budget. We currently have 1.6 billion cubic feet a day of the 1.8 Bcf a day of capacity subscribed under long-term contracts that are expected to generate approximately $16 million a month in revenue from demand charges.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines and Services segment increased 93% to $67 million for the third quarter of this year compared to $35 million for the third quarter of last year. We had increased throughput volumes on all of our onshore crude oil pipelines except Seaway, which continues to be impacted by the lack of demand for northbound transportation to the oversupplied Cushing Hub.</p>
          <p>Increased drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale led to higher volumes on our South Texas system, while increased production in the Barnett Shale benefited our Red River gathering system. Crude oil marketing margins improved over the third quarter of last year due to favorable crude differentials and the integration of pipeline expansion projects and our lease purchase business led to a 29% increase in volumes.</p>
          <p>We continue to develop the Wrangler pipeline project with Enbridge Inc. Subject to sufficient shipper commitments and regulatory approvals, the new pipeline would provide an outlet for more than 800,000 barrels a day of medium to light crude oil stranded at Cushing and priced at a substantial discount to crude imports that are based on Brent prices. The open season for this project is scheduled to end this evening at 5 o'clock.</p>
          <p>Excluding $8 million of insurance proceeds received in the third quarter of last year, our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment had a $6 million decrease in gross operating margin due in large part to the slowdown in permitting for exploration and production activity in the Gulf of Mexico and maintenance at certain upstream platforms and producing wells during the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Naturally occurring production declines that have not been offset by new drilling contributed to a $3 million decrease in gross operating margin and a 12% reduction in volumes at our Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline. We expect to receive additional volumes into the Independence and Cameron Highway pipelines in the fourth quarter of this year associated with the initial production from a new well and restart of other wells that have been down for recompletion and facility maintenance.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the Petrochemical and Refined Products and Services segment was $146 million this quarter compared to $166 million for the same quarter last year. The propylene fractionation business had a $16 million decline from the very strong third-quarter of 2002 due to lower volumes and sales margins. Propylene fractionation volumes were 4% lower this quarter due to refinery turnarounds and planned plant maintenance activity as well as new supply entering the market.</p>
          <p>The Refined Products Pipelines in Services business had a $29 million decrease in gross operating margin, primarily due to higher maintenance and pipeline integrity expenses as well as a decrease in Refined Products marketing sales margins.</p>
          <p>Pipeline volumes for the Refined Product Pipelines were 5% lower for the quarter. As we said in our call last quarter, structural shifts in population and refinery production in PADD 2 have led to a decline in demand for transportation of refined products from the gulf coast to the Midwest. Also several significant refinery expansions are coming online that are benefiting from cheaper WTI crude prices leading to an increase in refined products production in the Midwest.</p>
          <p>Our Octane Enhancement business reported an 88% increase in gross operating margin to a record $39 million for the quarter, largely due to higher margins and increased volumes and contributions from the high-purity isobutylene plants that we acquired out of bankruptcy in November of last year.</p>
          <p>We recently announced an increase in our quarterly cash distribution to $0.6125 per unit or $2.45 on an annualized basis. This was a 5.2% increase over the distribution declared with respect to the third quarter of 2010. It is also our 29th consecutive quarterly distribution increase and our 38th increase since our IPO in July of 1998.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with the record results this quarter. Our businesses continue to benefit from the development of shale plays, the growing demand for NGLs <mark type="ph" /> that speed stocks (4:07) by our petrochemical customers and crude oil basis differentials.</p>
          <p>Our integrated diversified asset base has served us well and we have clear visibility to future growth drivers with approximately $4.5 billion of energy infrastructure projects that are scheduled to be put in service between 2012 and 2014. With successful execution the expected cash flow accretion from these projects should provide us for future increases in our cash distributions to partners.</p>
          <p>Our success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees. We applaud their efforts and we remain excited about the many opportunities available to the Enterprise.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn the call over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. I'd like to focus on a number of the major projects we have under construction and give you some insights into a couple that we've recently announced. Suffice it to say that we remain disciplined in that what we build or buy has to fit what we already have. So no matter where the project falls along our value chain whether it be natural gas, NGLs or crude oil they have one thing in common and that is in addition to being good standalone investment opportunities, each has significant leverage to and thus brings incremental long-term value for our existing portfolio. Asset linkage is a core principle that our company was built on; it remains a key component to every investment we consider.</p>
          <p>The Acadian Haynesville pipeline that Mike talked about is an example of these criteria. The pipeline is a great investment opportunity in and of itself, but furthermore it takes our legacy system in South Louisiana to a whole new level because it makes the Haynesville Shale gas resources readily available to that pipeline and to our customer base.</p>
          <p>The Acadian Extension connects to, Chris, 12 interstate pipelines and terminates at our legacy Acadian System where it serves over 1.5 Bcf a day of industrial load in the Mississippi River Corridor. There isn't another play in the country where the wells produce the amount of gas that producers are finding in these wells and our Acadian System now originates in the sweet spot of the play and can not only deliver into those interstate pipelines, but terminates at one of the largest industrial corridors in the U.S. through our legacy system.</p>
          <p>In addition to the Haynesville Extension all of our natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil projects in the Eagle Ford are at or ahead of schedule and drilling and production in the play continues to exceed expectations. Our Eagle Ford 30, 36-inch rich gathering pipeline, our 900,000 a day processing facilities and incidentally we announced our third train just this week; our 127-mile NGL pipeline to Mont Belvieu and our 36-inch residue pipeline are all expected to be online by mid 2012. With over 3,500 drilling permits issued, 2,400 wells already drilled, approximately 200 rigs currently running, and 700 wells that are waiting on completion and/or infrastructure our processing capacity is sold out with firm, long-term commitments, frankly our assets can't get up and running soon enough.</p>
          <p>As expected, in addition to rich natural gas, the Eagle Ford is quickly becoming a large crude oil play, and work also continues on schedule for our Eagle Ford crude oil pipeline. Our pipeline project is being built in two phases running 215 miles through the heart of the crude oil window with an initial capacity of 350,000 barrels a day. And our network of terminals and storage along the pipe connecting to our new eco terminal near Houston will have a total storage capacity of approximately 5 million barrels. What's exciting, as more crude makes its way to the Gulf Coast, our eco-terminal can be expanded to accommodate up to 4.5 million barrels of crude tankage.</p>
          <p>Mike mentioned several other projects we have under construction like our Mid-America Rocky Mountain expansion, Frac 6 and our export facility. We're also expanding our propylene splitter business to be able to produce an additional 500 million pounds of polymer grade propylene. Each and every one of these projects leverages our existing asset footprint and brings additional value into our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We had two major JV projects we announced during the last quarter. The Texas Express NGL pipeline and the Cushing to Gulf Coast crude oil pipeline. We believe these are lucrative opportunities that are best done with strategic partners, with each company bringing complementary pieces together in order to make the opportunity a success. Like all the other investments, these projects are excellent, standalone opportunities, but equally important, these projects link and leverage our midstream assets, bringing incremental value to Enterprise.</p>
          <p>We're excited about the Texas Express NGL Pipeline, which currently has a binding open season underway and is being built as the JV among Enterprise, Anadarko and Enbridge. It has both gathering and transportation components for the growing plays in the Rockies, Midcontinent and West Texas, with each partner contributing attributes to the joint venture. But for Enterprise, this project adds incremental value to us by leveraging our existing Mid-America pipeline between Conway and Hobbs and provides significant new volumes to our NGL infrastructure at Mount Belvieu and along the Gulf Coast, feeding our fractionators, our storage, and our distribution network. In other words, our assets will feed this pipeline and our assets will be fed by this pipeline.</p>
          <p>Then there is the crude oil pipeline from Cushing to Houston with our partner Enbridge. We believe this partnership brings the right combination of strengths with Enbridge bringing strategic access to supplies north of Houston through existing pipe and Enterprise bringing access to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries through our connectivity from our ECHO terminal.</p>
          <p>Again, in addition to being a great investment opportunity for both Enterprise and Enbridge, this project will bring the rapidly growing supplies of crude oil from Cushing and points north of Cushing to our ECHO crude oil terminal and pipeline system, combining access to the growing North America crude oil supplies with our ability to reach every Houston area refinery and the entire Gulf Coast refining market through our pipeline and marine connectivity.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to discuss the Ethane Pipeline Project we have proposed in the Utica/Marcellus to the Gulf Coast for which we are currently connecting in open season. We have been laying the groundwork for this project for a while now and we believe new developments continue to point to the growing strategic importance of this project to both the North East producer community and Gulf Coast Petrochemicals. Producers not only continue to beat expectations in the Marcellus, but recently have also announced impressive acreage positions and drilling intentions for the nearby Utica which is also expected to be rich in NGLs.</p>
          <p>On the demand side, petrochemical companies continue to be focused on significant expansions in the U.S. because of the favored feedstock costs from growing shale reserves, primarily ethane. We believe these North East NGLs are now key to realizing the growth potential for the Gulf Coast centric petrochemical industry. Our conservative estimates anticipate more than 400,000 barrels a day of incremental ethane needed for ethylene expansions, debottlenecks, conversions and newbuilds over the next several years, with many of the expansions and conversions expected to occur over the next 12 to 36 months as petrochemicals are anxious to capitalize on the competitive advantage from domestic ethane.</p>
          <p>Our 1,230 mile pipeline will have an initial capacity of 125,000 barrels a day and because about one half of this project utilizes existing pipeline, the project is extremely competitive from both a cost and timing perspective. We announced a &#x2013; we had a press release this morning announcing that Chesapeake and Enterprise had agreed to a transportation services agreement. We're not surprised that Chesapeake's were the first to sign up as they've been quite supportive of our projects in the Barnett, the Eagle Ford, the Haynesville. Where else was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Everywhere. We believe that market fundamentals continue to underpin support for U.S., NGLs especially ethane, which remains highly advantaged compared to other feedstocks. Like all of the other projects we had discussed today, not only would this project be strategic to producers in petrochemicals, but it directly links into our infrastructure along the Gulf Coast and will provide additional supplies and opportunities to Enterprise.</p>
          <p>It addition, it lays the ground work for further extension of our integrated business model into the Marcellus and Utica plays much the same way that acquiring the Mid-America Pipeline System led to our building gathering and processing assets and the Piceance and the Jonah Pinedale fields that are now feeding our infrastructure of fractionation storage and distribution.</p>
          <p>In closing the U.S. shale gas and now shale oil phenomenon continues and as you all know the midstream industry is racing to keep pace. We remain focused on developing systems and providing services necessary to satisfy the growing supply and demand sides of this equation. Suffice it to say, we focus on both sides of the supply and the demand. We continue to find opportunities for capital and expect at least growing volumes will not only &#x2013; will add not only heads up returns but additional linkage to our entire portfolio.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Randy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. I'd like to take a few minutes just to discuss some additional financial items. General and administrative costs decreased to $50 million in the third quarter of 2011 from $70 million in the third quarter 2010. G&amp;A cost for the third quarter of 2011 include $10 million of expenses related to the Duncan Energy Partners merger, which closed in September 2011.</p>
          <p>While G&amp;A cost for the third quarter of 2010 included $14 million of expenses associated with the Enterprise GP Holdings merger. Also included in G&amp;A cost last year were approximately $20 million of charges related to the liquidation of certain employee partnerships in conjunction with the Enterprise GP Holdings merger.</p>
          <p>Interest expense was $189 million this quarter compared to $192 million reported for the third quarter last year. Average debt balances for the third quarter of 2011 was $14.8 billion versus the average net balance for the third quarter last year of $13.8 billion as far as in terms of -- we take interest costs and then we reduce that by capitalized interest to get to the interest expense.</p>
          <p>The capitalized interest number for the third quarter of 2011 was $33 million compared to about $12.5 million for the third quarter 2010. Year-to-date that capitalized interest number is approximately $75 million compared to about $33.5 million for the third quarter of 2010. We estimate capitalized interest for the full-year, will probably be about a $110 million to $115 million higher than what was reported last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for income taxes it increased to $12 million from $5 million reported in the third quarter of last year, primarily due to higher accruals for the Texas margin tax as a result of new assets placed into service in the state of Texas.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures were $1.1 billion this quarter which included $989 million for growth projects. Approximately 86% of the growth capital expenditures this quarter were for the Haynesville and for the Eagle Ford Shale related projects. Through the first nine months of this year we've spent $2.6 billion on growth capital projects and we expect to invest approximately $3.7 billion in total in growth capital projects for 2011.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures were $81 million this quarter and $218 million for the first nine months. We still expect to spend approximately $250 million to $275 million of sustaining capital for all of 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of capitalization, adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011, was $3.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less equity earnings plus the actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt principal to adjusted EBITDA was 4.0 times for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011. And that is after adjusting the debt for 50% equity treatment for the hybrid securities.</p>
          <p>Our floating interest rate exposure was approximately 11% of the total debt portfolio. The average debt life was 11 years if we use the first-call date for the hybrids. It's 16 -- a little over 16 years if we use the final maturity for the hybrids. And our effective average cost of debt was 5.4%.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity at September 30, we had consolidated liquidity of approximately $2.8 billion. That's cash on hand as well as availability under EPD's credit facility. In September, we closed on a new $3.5 billion, five-year credit facility that replaced our old credit facility that was scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>We had significant response from our banks. I want to say total commitments from our banks exceeded $5 billion. And we actually upsized the size of the facility from $3.25 billion to $3.5 billion and continue to be much appreciated of our bank group and the support that they have given us over the years.</p>
          <p>We used a portion of the proceeds from the borrowings under the new facility to refinance the indebtedness under the credit facility that was outstanding, the prior credit facility at EPD as well as refinancing the debt obligations of Duncan Energy Partners.</p>
          <p>At September 30, we had about $720 million outstanding under the new facility.</p>
          <p>With that Randy, I think we are ready for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. A couple questions, Jim I want to go back to a comment that Mike made earlier on the MAPL expansion. If you guys get the commitments sufficient to increase capacity to 85,000 barrels a day does it make sense for you guys to expand Hobbs capacity or is the better option to move more Y-grade directly to Belvieu and maybe expand either Seminole or Chaparral or possibly even laying other line right alongside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could, in fact, make sense to expand Hobbs. We hadn't decided yet there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that could be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the blue and the red line, though, Jim they're running full, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The shifting over to frac capacity at Belvieu Jim, how much of frac-6 capacity is going to be driven by volumes that are currently being diverted to Louisiana?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say, that again Darren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The frac-6 capacity, how much of that capacity do you think is basically going to be by volumes that are currently running through your fracs in Louisiana?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a big &#x2013; I think most of it's going to be based on Yoakum as we bring up the plants in Eagle Ford. There will be some that we'll be diverting, we're not diverting as much as we did. We will increase that flow through to Louisiana when the Eagle Ford plant comes on, but once that frac is up we see Eagle Ford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, here is kind of -- and I was thinking about it, I think the same way Jim, because you all have 600,000 a day of processing capacity at Yoakum that's under construction, you've got that new 300,000 a day train, which is going to online in the first quarter of '13. So, you could make the case that just the Y-grade out of Yoakum tailgate alone could support a frac-7. I don't want to put the horse too far ahead of the cart, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you sound like some of our guys on the sixteenth floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Last question from me Jim, just kind of a big picture question, and you touched on it earlier but when we're thinking about the supply demand balance for ethane going forward, if you don't factor in any of the new ethylene cracking capacity that could potentially be added and you just focus on the additional light end expansions and the conversions of existing crackers, do you think that's enough to handle the incremental ethane supply that's going to be hid in the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we've looked at, and I'm going to look at Tony Chovanec to confirm it, but I think what we've looked at, if you look at all the announced debottlenecks, expansions and conversions and you believe all of them, you're in the neighborhood of 150,000, 155,000 barrels a day of incremental demand. So there's a lot of demand. Anything we bring in, for example, if we do this project out of the Marcellus, there is a ramp to that project. So it's not like all that product is hitting the market at the same time. So right now, we're real comfortable in where we sit frankly. I'll go back to what we've said in the past, you just can't -- as a petrochemical industry it's hard to pass on the cost advantage they see in ethane.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of your customers mentioned &#x2013; sorry, some of your competitors mentioned that there have been some NGL pipeline outages specifically into Mont Belvieu. You guys mentioned some pretty strong NGL pipeline results. How much of those strong results that you guys reported are related to one-time outages on other lines or is it a more consistent trend than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our pipelines have been running full, so there is no impact at all on us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so the kind of year-over-year increase in results from Seminole, is Seminole and MAPL that's unrelated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's unrelated to that. We do have a tariff increase every July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so that's just the tariff increase. And I guess qualitatively if you guys wouldn't mind talking a little bit, I know there has been a trend especially in the Rockies where you guys have been kind of working out agreements with E&amp;P operators to give them back some of the NGL exposure and kind of move some of those key pole contracts that you had into more kind of high &#x2013; more high fee type contract structures. And I guess, I was wondering how the dynamic between the really strong processing results that you guys reported this quarter and the kind of move towards a more fee-based structure. How should I think about those two dynamics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first stab at it and then I'll let Jim jump in. Part of what's driving us to doing more fee-based deals is the fact that producers want the upside from the liquids. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for them to be drilling rich gas and giving away all the upsides from the liquids. So....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as, you guys mentioned a few kind of individual items with Pioneer and Meeker, but what -- can you guys give a percentage of that kind of $120 million increase in the NGL processing business that's attributable just to kind of higher NGL equity, NGL realizations for Enterprise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Brad, this is Randy. From a equity NGL production standpoint, we were actually less in the third quarter 2011 than we were in the third quarter 2010. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess that was kind of what I was getting at with such a strong increase, seeing the equity volumes decline, is the offsetting factor, just much higher price realizations on kind of a per barrel basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think between processing margins &#x2013; the effect as far as NGL prices on equity NGL production and then frankly the incremental gross operating margin from a huge increase in fee-based processing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one more, I think this is probably a question for Jim. As far as the propylene splitter expansion I think just in the last couple months or so, propylene prices have fallen off pretty hard. Maybe you guys could talk just a little bit about some of the factors that have led to that and how that affects &#x2013; kind of how you're thinking about the splitter expansion, if it affects it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's not going to affect the splitter expansion. Yes propylene prices have fallen, but the margin between refiner grade and polymer continues to be strong, so what we're focused on is the margin rather than the absolute. Chris, am I on base? And that will be on in the first quarter of next year?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>What we can say is that Conoco has already publicly stated that they're in discussions with us. And we kind of confirm that, beyond that we don't have a whole to say. I'm not sure what's going to happen and when. Meanwhile, we are continuing to work on the Wrangler pipeline.</p>

          <p>Okay. Following the sale of your gas storage business, are there other assets you're looking to divest to redeploy capital to your CapEx program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Important to note we only sold one part of our gas storage business, the Petal gas storage facility and frankly it fit Boardwalk much better than it did us. It wasn't connected to the rest of our system. We continue to look at our assets to see what makes sense for us to keep. Frankly most of our assets we really like. We've sold Alabama Intrastate Gathering System this quarter &#x2013; in the past quarter. So, Petal is expected to close here in the fourth quarter, but beyond that there's really nothing significant that we are looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the many projects you've announced recently and your existing projects, what's your view of 2012 expansion CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talked about the amount of projects that we expect to go into service between 2012 and 2014. And as you can probably guess we got a fairly healthy capital budget for all 2012, '13, and 2014, we're actually looking at more projects. So I think that if you look at our capital spending for the last couple of years, it's probably indicative of what we'll do next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And given the significant amount of spending, you probably have about another $1 billion or so left to 2011 and a few billion in 2012. What are your thoughts about equity financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You look at the amount of capital that we've spent this year on growth projects and our financial metrics coming out in the third quarter at four times debt to EBITDA, and also consider that the Haynesville project, a $1.5 billion project just went into service yesterday and it will start generating $16 million a month in demand charges. We've done all that with no equity issuances this year. So to me it looks like we're in pretty good shape.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian one thing I just add on to what Mike said, I guess as far as an asset that we would consider selling -- obviously we still have $30 million ETE units. And that's also been able to come in and frankly keep us out of the equity markets by coming in and selling some of those holdings. We've been deliberate the way we have been selling those units. We'll continue to be deliberate in the way we do that, but that's also given us a lot of financial flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian so far this year we've sold about $9.1 million energy transfer equity units for proceeds of about $354 million.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question &#x2013; a couple of questions, but first around the Marcellus and ethane and I want make sure I heard this right from you Jim. You said 400,000 barrels a day needed of ethylene expansions over the next 12 to 36 months, that's what you guys said you kind of have in your forecast. And I guess if I heard that correctly, how confident are you guys in this, what &#x2013; is this visible things that already are in process from the petchems? And then as a subset to that, can you think of how much ethane ultimately comes down to the Gulf Coast from the Northeast, maybe even above and beyond your project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let, can &#x2013; I'm going to let -- let's let Tony answer the first part of that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 400,000 barrels a day is between now and call it 2015, 2016, not over the next 12 to 36 months. So there's a smaller number that the industry has announced and that we massage to project over the next 12 to 36 months, but that's a number we think is going to come probably by the 2015 timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What Tony has in his numbers and they track this pretty closely and you can tell my definition probably wrong, but they are in the right direction. I mean 400,000 what I had in the comments is less than what he wanted me to put in there. But what that includes, it doesn't include all the announced newbuilds, I think it includes two ethylene plants...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's the debottlenecks, it's conversions, it's expansions. For example I think Dow's announced they're going to bring the St. Charles plant back on and it assumes to &#x2013; I'll go back to &#x2013; if you don't have any newbuilds, you still looking at a 150,000 to 160,000 barrels a day of incremental needs given those expansions of debottlenecks.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question, as to how much we can expect to bring down from the Marcellus and the Utica, I'm not sure we have a clue at this point; our pipeline can do up to 155,000, 160,000 fairly easily with power and looping, can get up close to 200,000. I think what's exciting for us in addition to the pipe itself is -- go back to what I said when we bought Mid-America, it led to the Piceance, Jonah, Pinedale, Meeker and Pioneer and we're in a position &#x2013; if we're able to do this project we're in a position to leverage that further upstream because it fits what we have now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. On the cost for this ethane project with Chesapeake, is there any ballpark that you can give in terms of how that's stated now, what it would cost you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, we're a little early in this, we haven't done engineering work yet to get comfortable with announcing a number, but frankly we've got a lot of the pipe that we're just going to be reversing. So as Jim said in his comments, it's going to be very economic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally from me, how should we thinking about return rates on capital employed for some of these new projects, like potentially Wrangler, but like this ethane project that you're doing with Chesapeake? Is this &#x2013; or do you think now incrementally more than projects have been in the past given the need from producers to have infrastructure built?</p>

          <p>I think what &#x2013; the way you ought to look at it is, first of all it's going to be demand charge driven, so we're not going to be held hostage to the vagrancies of the market. It's going to pay a regular monthly fee. The returns are going to be -- depending on how you look at it, they're going to be attractive, but I can't tell you what that number is. If you look at the Marcellus pipeline and you recognize that part of that pipe is already in refined product service, the way we look at it is, we're going to take that out of our refined product service so there's a certain amount of revenue that we're going to lose associated with that business that we're going to pick up on ethane. so it gets a little bit complicated.</p>
          <p>The other thing -- take Wrangler for example we might be targeting a certain rate of return but what we've seen this year and frankly for the last probably couple of years is that we've consistently seen project coming in under budget. So while we might be targeting for that kind of a pipeline &#x2013; a mid-teen kind of return, it might be more or less depending on where we actually come out with the spending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing is when we look at our returns we look at them differently if they're demand fee supported and then as they support our downstream infrastructure, so we look at it in the context to the total.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good morning. Given the -- given your excess cash flows balance sheet and extensive expansion projects, I know this question kind of comes around a lot I'll get &#x2013; I'd be clear with where I'm going with it, but how do you think about acquisitions in the current environment and where I'm heading with that is really &#x2013; in particular if you look at the ethane pipeline out of the Marcellus, if that moves forward do you think there's an opportunity to either acquire or build processing in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is yes. But I think our tendency has been towards building. Acquisitions still are very pricy these days, there's still a lot of MLPs that don't appear to have much way to grow other than to acquire assets by building. We have little more control over where that products goes, how it ties into our system how we continue to create that value chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second question just as a follow up to Darren's line of question on the Eagle Ford. You have a bunch of stuff coming online, the Yoakum Plant, NGL Pipeline and a crude pipeline. How do you think about the ramp up of volumes behind those assets as they come online or should we expect them to be gradual or is there just a lot of volume there that they're almost going to be running full when you get them online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. This is Mark Hurley. It will be gradual following the production curves of the producers in the area. We expect these volumes to peak in about the 2014, 2015, 2016 range depending on how aggressively the producers are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Tom Zulim. From the gas side once our new processing plants come on at Yoakum, they'll be full immediately because if you remember how we operate our system in South Texas it's all interconnected between the existing seven and the new gas processing facility. So those will be full with the new Eagle Ford gas and to the extent that it's not full with Eagle Ford gas, we'd simply will gas from other areas to fill up the newer, more efficient Yoakum processing plant. So, Yoakum will be full either way from day one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could you speak to how the nature of the cash flows are changing with &#x2013; I guess the question is how much &#x2013; do you have a sense of how much is the cash flow now is fee-based and drilling even little bit further down, when you think about the processing plants what percentage of proceeds versus now being fee-based?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, I think from a total company standpoint, probably 2010, we were probably 70% fee-based in nature when you looked at gross operating margin. I think with Haynesville coming on and some of the other fee-based pipelines coming up out of the Eagle Ford that probably gets us into the &#x2013; and also the new fee-based revenues coming from the processing plants. I think that probably gets us around 75%. You remember we just got a big gross operating margin number to move, but again it probably mid 70% range maybe tick it up 76%, 77%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The last number you gave was what now? How much you thought was 67, 6 &#x2013; what was that last number and what was the context there, I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With -- as we bring on more fee-based assets you might &#x2013; my guess is with the Haynesville coming on and the Eagle Ford projects coming on you'd probably see us trend that gross operating margin would be comprised of about 75% fee-based in nature. With some of the other announcement that we've got that could bring it up to 76%, 77% because it's going to take us little time to get all those assets on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Having said what you just said does that change the nature at all in terms of how you think about financing going forward, how you think about perhaps the distribution policy going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me get the distribution part out the way and Randy can pick up on the rest of it. We've been very conservative in the way that we manage our distributions and we recognize that NGL margins are pretty wide right now. We're in the midst of another year of heavy construction. As we've always said we think that it make sense for our unit holders long-term if we take a portion of our distributable cash flow and reinvest in assets that generate even more cash that we can consistently increase distributions going forward. Having said that, if you look at our distribution coverage this quarter at 1.7 times, recognize that part of that is the sale of energy transfer equity units.</p>
          <p>We also again are in a pretty strong business environment and we've had some projects come in under budget, which means we've had less capital going out the door. So on a more normalized basis you'd look at that distribution coverage as being more like 1.3 times. We'll continue to look at that every quarter and see if further distribution increases are warranted beyond what we've done historically, but we're going to be very careful about the way we do that. Randy you want to talk just about investment grade metrics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Yves as far as the &#x2013; given the scale, the size that we are, given more the fee-based nature of the business, given the new projects with more demand charges, and I think frankly getting some of the larger projects, Haynesville was a big step. That was our largest single project at $1.5 billion. All these Eagle Ford projects that we are talking about that's really about 20 to 25 smaller projects that are all very doable. As we come in and get those in service, I think you continue to look at Enterprise and at least what our debt holders are telling us or what the market is telling us by where our credit spreads are is they are de-risking Enterprise. As far as coming in and looking at the credit spread, and at some point, you would think that would manifest itself with the ratings that we have with the agencies too, but at least that's what the market is telling us. Also when you come in and you look at the way we've &#x2013; our debt financing is longer term in nature. We're not reliant on the &#x2013; probably costs us some money, but we're not relying on a 0% fed funds rate going forward. Fed funds rate, if it every comes up, I think our debt portfolio is in pretty good shape, it's the way we've been financing the assets.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great answer. Thank you. And then just the last question, a big picture for Jim, if he would. Given the proliferation of liquid, could you see a change in the dynamics and we've gone through this dance before in terms of maybe building fractionation and maybe even ethylene plants up in the Northeast, especially if you think the Utica is going to play out and maybe you can put that in to the context of the ethane header that you've been talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure, I know what to expect long-term from the Utica and Marcellus because it just seems to grow every time we look at it. I guess all things are possible. Personally I think you want to take your product to the biggest sponge in the market and that's the U.S. Gulf Coast and that's why we're looking at creating a system that will support the crackers down here. I've seen one party talk about building a cracker in the Marcellus. Everybody else, they're talking about the Gulf Coast and I expect that's where it will be built. And I think the Marcellus liquids are being attracted to the Gulf Coast instead of being pushed to the Gulf Coast. By that I mean there's an appetite for it. I think it's required rather than a disposal issue.</p>

        </plist>

          <p>Okay. And just turning to Wrangler for one second, just trying to think about how you guys are thinking about it, when you do your analysis of if Seaway gets reverts versus Wrangler are you assuming within that context that Keystone does get built definitively?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just Michael's question was reminding me, on the propane export volumes, what are they now and with the expansion what do you expect those to be going to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it really boils down to how much supply you can generate, because what you export is 98% propane instead of the HD5 domestic that's about 95% really. So you're &#x2013; what you're going to have -- what you're going to be able to export is a function of what you can produce. That's an added benefit of our fractionators and our PP splitters and I'm looking at Rudy Nix, I think we're in the neighborhood of being able to produce 150,000 barrels a day of export quality propane. .And I think that's going to dictate what our capacity is. It's what you produce not necessarily.</p>
          <p>In terms of our loading rate what we're looking at is being able to capture the right time of the month as to when we do export. And that's a pricing issue that we can talk about offline. But we're looking at being able to produce about 150,000 barrels a day of export quality propane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the &#x2013; Randy you're talking about the fee-based moving to 76% or 77%. I guess in terms of looking forward, say to around 2013, do you expect to hit about 80% fee-based by then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think the 76%, 77% is probably 2013. Looking forward you can see that the new projects that we are building are all fee-based, and the legacy contractors have the key pole. Those volumes are declining. So that's going to naturally represent a smaller piece of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks for that clarification there. And then I guess Jim, if you could comment just in terms of the supply-demand dynamic in liquids do you see kind of an oversupply bump coming into the market or do you see it staying relatively balanced each year here through 2015 or so, if you could comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to get into too much detail as to what we are doing, but I think one of the &#x2013; we see a several opportunities created by petrochemicals preferring ethane, by additional supply, and we are working those opportunities. Frankly at this point I really don't see a situation where we're going to get the supply long relative to demand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>We are in discussions with several others. Our open season ends the 10th &#x2013; and I think we'll know by the 10th whether or not we have enough.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So by the 10th you'll know if you can go forward on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And then on the Eagle Ford Shale I just &#x2013; I'm curious now, what's your outlook &#x2013; somebody mentioned that it was going to peak I guess somewhere, 2014, '16. What's the outlook now for oil and gas production coming out of that area? What's your best guess as to where things will -- where are we now and then where is it going to in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to look to Tom, but every time I turn around they're bringing a new train in, because the oversold the ones we're building, so we've announced 900 million a day of processing and I think we're sold out and they keep hustling more business. Our system down there is absolutely chock-a-block full. In fact, our people estimate every morning and talk about how we're going to handle the gas, how we're going to handle the liquids and it's more than we expected at this point and there doesn't seem to be an end to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just lined up in the queue, it's pretty robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a crude perspective I think it's &#x2013; Mike hit it, we got a lot of trucks working down there. I think whenever the first phase comes on we've got strong contracts to support that phase. I think it will be a little bit of a ramp. But I think we're doing some things that we're going to realize more value out of that crude down the road without getting into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you run through gas on what the barrels per day -- where you think it is now and where you think it's going to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Mark Hurley. We see it today at around 200,000 to 250,000 barrels a day and we see it peaking probably around 750,000 to 800,000 barrels a day but there're cases where it can go higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John these are based on what we know today and it seems like every month, every quarter some new discovery or new techniques for getting the stuff out of the ground. It's kind of a hard thing to anticipate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on this Yoakum announcement, I can't even keep track with all your announcements, but Yoakum with this addition here, would that imply that the 600 million cubic feet a day is completely sold out because you were talking about adding 300 more. And then also, if you could give us any numbers with respect to cost, and then also on NGL production I guess before and after the addition on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The 600 is fully subscribed, the 900 is virtually there. I've mentioned earlier on the type of GPM we're seeing from the Eagle Ford today, the richness of that gas you can expect to have upwards of 35,000 barrels a day of Y-grade production out of each of the 300 trains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much. That's all I had.</p>
