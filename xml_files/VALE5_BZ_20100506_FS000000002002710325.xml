        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending this conference. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. Let's start our discussion in this conference call by saying that what we saw in the first quarter of the year just confirmed our expectations about the future for our company and our industry and markets in general. We see &#x2013; we saw a very positive development and very much in line with what we discussed in the previous earnings release and throughout the &#x2013; particularly the second half of 2009. So, recovery is on the way, and we are happy to see that we were right including, well, in fact preserving our growth capacity, our investments throughout the most difficult period of the world economy in the last 80 years.</p>
          <p>So, our agenda today, we are going to talk about some, a few variables in our first quarter release, and then very important topic -- how we are dealing with this total change that is taking place particularly in the iron ore market. Then, we will comment on how we see the world economy evolving, and finally, a few comments in how we addressing this very bright scenario in terms of our strategy and managing the tools to promote growth and value creation.</p>
          <p>Starting with the first quarter release, we had a very sound performance. Operating revenues grew by 4.7%, adjusted EBIT margin by almost 1,400 basis points, EBITDA 33% and net earnings 5.6% growth. So, very positive performance, clearly stating what we said about the recovery of the economy. Not only the absolute numbers but the very quality of the results showed improved in the first quarter of 2010 with a predominance of operating income explaining the performance of net earnings, another evidence of the strong operational performance that we had.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our EBITDA was favored by a very clear effect of prices, the prices associated with the very development that we commented just now and also cost reduction, a very important element in explaining the variation of EBITDA from the fourth quarter of '09 to 2010. Some seasonally lower R&amp;D expenses and exchange rate was explained the remaining effect counterbalanced by lower dividends and sales volumes that we observed in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter given the seasonality also related to the production particularly in the northern region and the rainy season.</p>
          <p>Well, on cost, as I said, was a major achievement in our view with the $354 million of actual cost savings. We said in the fourth quarter release that there were some non-recurring elements explaining the sharp increasing costs of then but also on the top of that, the lack of those elements in the first quarter, we also had important contribution of cost savings to drive down total cost to $4.4 billion down from almost $5 billion in the fourth quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>So turning to the second session: Let's talk about the total change that is taking place particularly in iron ore market. This is, of course, a result &#x2013; direct result of the shift of geographies and the new players that came to the market particularly in the last decade and this very decade. We are talking about China. So if in the past, Japan was the major driver of the establishment of our new &#x2013; new prices and new supply demand arrangement, now we see that China is also playing a role of &#x2013; transformational player in the iron ore market. And we see that today most of the seaborne, almost 70% of the seaborne is driven by China. So, it's a massive change in this market and, of course, in line with this change of players there are also changes in the way things are done, the way things are discussed. And the very resurgence of the very increase of the relevance of spot iron ore in total global seaborne, it's an important element of the discussion. And with that I would like to turn the floor to Martins to comment about this transformations and how he sees the new arrangement taking place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everybody. Good afternoon. First of all, Fabio already explained it. China is now is the driving factor behind the iron ore demand in the world -- 70% of the seaborne is now driven by China. And the second consequence is that the spot inside China is a very important factor. So the combination of huge increase in the demand from China and also the huge increase of seaborne, a huge increase of spot markets, spot pricing in the iron ore in China is driving the market now.</p>
          <p>In the past, we never had the liquids market to drive the price of iron ore and now we have, so I think that is the main change here with this going on, in the last 3 or 4 years. This fact is increasing and now reached the point that we cannot live with the system we are used to live in the past. Vale always defended benchmark system, we always support the benchmark system, but we learned in the last crisis that benchmark system is not working anymore.</p>
          <p>Part of our customers in China decided to buy in the spot. Outside China, we have a lot of different behaviors, but one way or another, is regarding the contract or commitment. Some customers postponed their purchasing in order to get a better price after the new benchmark was set up. Some of the customers didn't treat us what we call in a fair way because the customers -- iron ore is only used to produce the steel. So we recognize this fact, so when the customer is not producing so he can reduce the purchasing of iron ore from us but has to do it in a fair way. And Vale learned during this crisis that we were the most affected iron ore company. Although we defended the system, we were affected by the system negatively. So our commitment to benchmarking is over, and we now want to move to a pricing system that has more relationship with the market, that is always there. In the past, we didn't have kind of spot market reference, but now we have. So if you have, if the size is big enough to give liquidity, to give it transparent and also to avoid the manipulation. So that's very reasonable for us to use this market as a reference. And so that's what we are doing.</p>
          <p>We are now -- we have put this quarter 100% of our sales on the new system, which is based on average of the market price. We have decided that we have kind of promise for the customer to see where the price will be for the next quarter. We also have reference for the quality, so we have, how to price the VIU &#x2013; value-in-use of iron ore. So, and also it's probably kind of band. If the price is staying inside that band, we keep the same price. So we are not telling that the price has to be a secret, only for three months. Though we don't have a big variation in the average price, in our -- the price could be the same forever. So as long as the averages stay inside that band. So you can see the difference between -- we can see there's not only quality difference but also proximity, the customer that's closer to the iron ore. We pay less on CFR basis.</p>
          <p>So I think in this system we are -- we design and then we negotiate with our customer has some very, very good correctness, and I think it's fair. One other point that we look into system is transparent. The system we can look at the prices, I think today. you can see everyday, several sources of spot price in China. You can look the sites, you can look at the newspapers, you have a lot of publications that have these prices.</p>
          <p>So the prices are transparent, and we are completely open to negotiate the different indexes or basket of index and different averages. So whatever the customers can agree with that, and we are open to give a freedom to negotiate the average and to negotiate the indexes in our basket of index. We can also negotiate the band. So there is a freedom for negotiation.</p>
          <p>So we are not imposing a system, but we want a system that avoided discretion and avoided every year disputes. We want to have a more proactive and more beneficial relationship with our customers. And every year discuss if the price will increase, it's 60, 70% or going down 30, 40, 50%, is always a question of dispute between customers. In the past benchmark system, Vale Asia was 2, 3, 5, 10%, so now, we are going towards a period that their market is running so fast that you need a system that can have what we call flexibility that adjust faster to the market conditions.</p>
          <p>And we believe that after we have more time with this new system, customers will feel more comfortable with that. We can avoid a lot of distortions like with this big difference between spot and benchmarks. People trying to buy at benchmark prices to sell on a spot basis to make a lot of money. So a lot these distortions that brought not only, not only economically aspects to the business, we want to avoid, and we think that the system that we are discussing with our customers now will help in this way.</p>
          <p>If you want more details on this new arrangement that we are discussing, we have in our earnings release a detailed description of what we are discussing with our clients.</p>
          <p>Moving to the prospects of the economy, we, what we see is that manufacturing growth is underway, and of course industry performing, the industrial production increasing, it's a major driver of additional demand for minerals and metals. We have the PMI there to record levels and the global industry production also resuming a very steady growth path, meaning that more demand is out there for minerals and metals in particular, but that's not only minerals and metals, the whole economy as a whole should grow this year in the range of 3.5 to 4%. That -- and so this is part of this process in which emerging market economies are of course major drivers, but currently on a very clear recovery of the US economy.</p>
          <p>Global carbon steel output, if you see slide 17, it's back to the peak level before the crisis in June 2008. Of course, there is a major change in composition in China assuming a larger share. But the fact is that from the standpoint of steel production, global steel production, we are back to where we were just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. And the very positive environment is, of course, favoring price formation of iron ore, and we see there in slide 18 that one of the latest figures we have, iron ore ton at $176 according to Platts Iron Ore Index at 62%. This is just a very important comment, Martins just reminded me about this, because another indication of this trend of the market is a very contributable to the 1% differential that is showing a very high-level compared to what we observed throughout 2009. Now it's estimated to be around $5.50 per ton -- at 1% -- sorry, yeah.  Sorry, 1% per ton. So if we are talking about Caraj&#xE1;s at 67%, we are talking about $27.50 more on top of the price that we have seen here, just to give you a reference of what Martins said about daily news.</p>
          <p>We also believe that there is no sense talking about the deceleration in the Chinese economy. This economy has shown its resilience over time and what we see today is an increased importance of the domestic demand in the much more selected macroeconomic stabilization set of measures. So instead of what we saw in 2007, 2008 when credit was good across the board, what now as we put in our release, we have clear targets for the methods that having been adopted, whereas speculative buying forms, for instance, are being curbed and the developing of new supply of lower income, lower end houses have been stimulated by the government. So it's a much more clever, smart approach and this should not represent any threat in our view to the future growth prospect of China. To the contrary, what we see is the growing importance of domestic demand in total GDP, and this should further reduce the vulnerability of the economy moving forward to fluctuations in the developed particularly in Europe where, of course, the continent has a major challenge ahead of it. So, the result is that prices are reflecting the strength of the market with as we saw the plateau, that  63% and we don't see any meaningful change in the supply of iron ore, like Martins said, in China at this stage even with this price incentive that is right there.</p>
          <p>I think the main competition could come from local ore, and it seems they're reaching their limits as far as iron ore content, as far as environmental difficulty that they have there. So it seems that local production cannot grow as part as the local iron ore production is going. So supply, they're restricted and demand very strong, so the result is as we've shown by market indicator as it can appreciate for the last few slides. Turning to the stainless steel, I would like to ask our colleague Tito Martins to comment on the industry, the nickel industry and its demand. Tito, Could you please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Fabio, thank you. As you can see in the slide 21, we are seeing a recover in stainless steel market. As was said before, most of the metal markets are returning to growth. We see a very strong demand coming from China. In terms of nickel consumption, we are not sure about their levels of the stocked nickel in the Chinese market, but we know that if the situation remains as it is today, we should see a more stable level from nickel price. If we look at the side 22, prices are back where they were in 2008, in mid 2008 showing that the demand is strong. As a consequence of the demand in China, you can also see some movements U.S. and Latin Europe. In any case, our customers, they have been much more concerned about the supply of nickel in the world and we are confident that the market should be more stable along the next year.</p>
          <p>Specifically about our production, I think it's important to mention that you will not see in our numbers but we have been managed to return to the production in the Canadian operations mostly in Sudbury and Newfoundland and Labrador. And in the second quarter, we should be able to show in our numbers the results of this return. We have already managed in the last quarter to produce more than 6,300 tons of nickel in Sudbury and reflecting actually almost less than three months of production because we started the furnace in Sudbury at the end of January. So we have committed to supply for our customers, and we think that the market is actually eager to see our products coming back.</p>
          <p>And to you, Fabio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. To finalize the initial discussion, let's talk a little bit about the strategy and how we have been managing the several tools to reach growth and value creation. And as you can see in slide 23, discipline in capital allocation is the essence of our strategy. So we have a mutual line growth to value creation as we put there through existing assets and new assets. So we have been exploring all of them in a way that we believe is very efficient given the results that we are delivering to our shareholders, we have been delivering to our shareholders in the last several years.</p>
          <p>So as part of our development as new assets for instruments we have or the existing assets that, sorry, we have the expansion of Caraja's, the additional 20 million tons &#x2013; a very creative project. That was the device by Martins' team, and we managed through, by adjusting the original project, to double the expected result of our original additional spend, and the result that is the only major project that we have coming in the stream this year at a very low CapEx cost of  $29 per ton. So it's a very important achievement and on the top of that, it's environmentally friendly as you can appreciate that.</p>
          <p>And on the other side, on the acquisition of assets, I would like Martins to comment a little bit on Simandou. That's a major important acquisition that we just announced, and Martins was the chief negotiator and strategist behind this very important acquisition for Vale. Martins, could you comment on Simandou very briefly, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Simandou is a project that was always in our radar. So as Vale arrived a little bit later at that area, competitors were there many years before. So it took some time from us to put our foot there. And finally we got the opportunity to do it. Simandou is one of the largest resources of iron ore in the world, high quality, similar to Carajas, also quality and quantity wise. So for Vale, it was always our dream to be there. And we came a little bit later but we have the opportunity to reach this agreement with the SGR. So now we're there, and our plan is to foster as fast as possible production in that area.</p>
          <p>As you probably know, we have a lot of resources in Brazil and we're developing it, but situation here is taking more time because &#x2013; to get the approvals, environmentally speaking, takes a long time. And we believe that even though we can move faster in this development, this is a project that will affect not only here but also Liberia because we have the rights to ship the ore through the Liberia corridor. We are negotiating with the Liberian government also the rights to use the existing railway but also the rights to build a new track and a new port in order to optimize the volume they're looking for.</p>
          <p>We expect by 2012 to be producing ore there, something between 10 and 15 million pounds but the project will reach 50 million pounds in 2014 and could produce even more if we find enough resource to it. So we put a lot of -- we're going to put a lot of efforts in Simandou and by doing that, we can guarantee that we can reach the 450 million tons that we desired to be producing by 2014.</p>
          <p>Fabio made some comments about the new 10 &#x2013; 20 million tons project in Carajas, and that project was designed to cope with the delay, the project for 30 million tons in Carajas because for the 30 million tons, we didn't get the permit. So, we have to find a way to increase the production in the existing filed. And then we come up with this 10 million ton project that's increased to 20 million tons. And what we learned with this project, now make us very comfortable to increase the also the 30 million tons project to 40 because we are adopting the same system, which is to process iron ore in a dry way instead of through washing and all of this stuff that requires a lot of water and a lot of area for the dump.</p>
          <p>So by looking for solutions relating to the permit, we come up a lot of solutions that increase the possibility of increasing production. And we also are &#x2013; our idea is to bring the same principle to Simandou in order to avoid the environmental consequences and also adopt the whole project.</p>
          <p>Simandou is only four hours from Brazil by flight. So we are in a very strong position to leverage from our people in Brazil because even for assistance production system based on fly in, fly out it will be much easier for Vale to do it than everybody else. We are very close to that region and this is another advantage that we have by doing that there. We know the kind of ore. We have the experience in new technologies for producing ore, and we are closer to Simandou, which will reduce the risk of implementation a lot. So I am very confident in this project that we will bring more consistence in our production and will give to our customers a new source, a new production system that can increase even the reliability of our deliveries to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we see, we have inventive growth, the additional 20 as Martins explained; the acquisitions Carajas and Simandou &#x2013; Simandou, sorry; and then we have the portfolio asset management. Through which we are aiming at locking asset value, improved capital allocation and focus our efforts in larger businesses.</p>
          <p>And with that I would like to turn to Tito, that was and he is in charge of the aluminum business and was the chief negotiator of the deal with Norte. Tito, could you comment on the following foreign rights, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fabio. It's very simple and I think most of the analysts have already made some comments about what we announced last Sunday. Basically, Vale owns very good reserves, very important reserves of bauxite in Brazil. We have the expertise and the knowledge about aluminum potential. Paragominas became the most important aluminum plant in the world with the last &#x2013; implementation in the last phase. And we have, of course, we have some constraints about energy cost. So our future in the aluminum business is direct link with the possibility to grade our assets on a more competitive level of cost of energy.</p>
          <p>So it was natural to join Hydro in this transaction.  Hydro has the technology and expertise in aluminum production, and at the same time at very competitive costs of energy. So we combined the assets in this new organization &#x2013; new Hydro. Vale is not leaving the business. It remains with 22% stake in the new company, enjoying the potential upside of this integration. And the total transaction amounted to something around $5.3 billion when considered the cash that will be received and also the debt that we'll overtake by April.</p>
          <p>We decided to hold the 40% stake in MRAM given the agreements we have in the company right now. But we actually enjoy various benefits from this MRAM production, which is considered one of the benchmarks in the world right now. And of course with this we are &#x2013; we will have the time to focus in business as we actually can enjoy more a flexibility where we are based right now, I don't if Fabio you want to mention --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to stress that this aluminum deal will make feasible our growth through integration with Norsk. So Norsk brings in what we lack, which is competitive energy costs so this deal has a lot of synergy and through integration and we will make feasible growth in a business in Brazil that was not feasible or doable considering the prevailing energy costs. As Tito mention, of course, as part &#x2013; it is huge part of our portfolio management and just last quarter we announced our acquisition of fertilizer assets. So in some we have been extremely active in exploring all the tools to promote growth and value creation in our company.</p>
          <p>Thank you, very much and with that we close our initial remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the clarification on the new iron ore pricing. I have two questions here. The first one is related to your production -- sorry, your Carajas Serra Sul project, because you're talking about now doing the 450 million tons by developing the Simandou asset and maybe not Carajas, so I just would like to understand how is importance of the Carajas Serra Sul in your order of importance here. And also if you decide to go ahead with both projects at the same time, if you think that there is going to be demand for a 50 million ton project in Simandou and a 90 million ton project in Serra Sul by 2014. And my second question is also related to Simandou, if you could give us some more details on the project mainly related to cost, the CapEx that you would have to spend there, and also some of the legal aspects of the ownership of the concession given that Rio Tinto used to be the owner then and they might challenge the ownership of the concession. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martins, could you please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Felipe, a lot of questions. So starting with the Simandou and Serra Sul, our intention is to move with both projects, but you probably know, we are a little bit -- we have a delay already for the Serra Sul project. It is a huge project, it is a greenfield project and so we are facing difficulty to get all the approvals. And we are going to get it, but it will take much more time that we first realized. So Simandou will give us flexibility to start producing sooner there, because the conditions for producing sooner is there in the Zogota area. And then we can move later and adjust according to what we are doing in Serra Sul also.</p>
          <p>So I think both projects we will go forward, but the time schedule could change a little bit according to the licenses that we can get. And also we have many other projects in the southern system that can be delayed a little bit. So Simandou gives big flexibility for us as far as the permit is concerned. In the case of the Carajas 30 million tons project, we are now more than two years late. We have a delay more than two years because of this licensing. So for Serra Sul, you already had more than one year delay. So in case of Simandou, that will give us a lot of flexibility and then we can adjust later, our investment, our CapEx according to the market situation.</p>
          <p>We don't intend to create an over-capacity in the market, and I don't think we need to do it. But I think if you have a new area for producing in a new environment even in terms of environmental concerns, will help us to guarantee that in 2014, we can get 450 million tons, which will be what the market will need and reasonably with the same CapEx. We don't intend to invest more and to create over-capacity. But to have some strategic freedom to develop other areas, okay, so that's the main point.</p>

          <p>Yeah, because we know that we don't have a good ore in the world, okay. What you have is reasonable ore. So, and more and more production will come from this reasonable ore. And for using the reasonable ore, they needed to use a good ore, so demand for high quality ore will always be there.</p>
          <p>During this crisis, we didn't reduce our turnout production of Carajas, for instance. We have to reduce a lot of production in the southern system and southeastern system, but in the north we keep the Carajas running at full capacity without no reduction. So demand for good ore will be there because more and more people are producing better ore. And that situation, unless you have a big change in technology in the steel industry that's moving from existing blast furnace to another kind of reduction system, the permanence of good ore will be there. And we see it, by the way, we are pricing now the VIU more than $20 above the normal ore. So we don't see big problems in producing and shipping a high-quality ore going forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the project, our intention is to produce as I told you 50 million tons there. From mining investment, this is really -- we can see investment around $2 billion in the mining area. And the remaining will be on the logistics system and also in the compensations, because to get ore from -- through Liberia, we have to compensate the Guinea government and make some investments in like existing railway there for people usage and more cargo uses. So the total investment in there, looking at today, would be above $5 billion, but we needed to work more on it and to make all the engineering in order to give a better figure for you.</p>
          <p>As far as the legal ownership is concerned, we took all the precautions. As you probably know, we don't have to make investments like that without knowing all of these legal aspects and that we are really -- we are not concerned with any bad development on this regard. We took all the precautions and we have all the measures in place to go forward with this without any big problems as far as legal aspect is concerned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a question on the pricing mechanism. I wonder if you could comment on how you will work for pellets, is it -- I think it is the same type of index pricing. And since especially, you mentioned, Martins, that one of the virtues of the new system is transparency. If we take the index or the Platts Index or whatever index you're using today, what would be the price increases for both iron ore and pellets in the second quarter compared to what was the contract price last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as pellets, we have a premium above defined, okay, as we're used to do in the past. And unfortunately, we have to negotiate customer by customer and that's what we did, and we got an agreement based on that. And I think that the price for pellets will be more &#x2013; we'll charge more than the defined price, okay, because of conditions in the pellet markets is even more dynamic than the condition in the normal ore. For this quarter, we reached an agreement with customers to charge around $50 per ton of premium for pellets. So that's what we are doing, and but I don't know what to do next quarter because, as I told you, the dynamics in the pellet market is bigger than the normal &#x2013; fine if you have a direct competition with the scrap, with solid big iron ore, so with other sources of iron units. So as you remember, last year we had to reduced the price of pellets below the price of lump ore, so there is a completely different market for pellet and a little bit different market dynamics. But for this quarter what we got is something around the $50.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My first question is now on the pricing mechanism for the first quarter. Since it's four months delayed and mostly based on flats, if you would do rough calculation based on the best months price index and the next month's futures, it would suggest that for fines you would have an another, let's say 31, 32% price increase in the third quarter. My first question is, if these calculations matches what Vale thinks for the market in the first quarter for fines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodrigo, this is your call. Let's wait for the second quarter results and we'll let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And my second question is regarding the freight. I want to know if you can update us what you are doing in terms of freight, in terms of hedging your volume, converting ships and what will be ultimately the target size Vale's freight to ship iron ore to China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martins, could you comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is a very important of our strategy because freight is a source of arbitration in the market. So in the past when you have the benchmark system and spot price in China, the freight though has made the balance between the spot and the benchmark. So that's the situation before. Now that we are going to a more flexible mechanism, and that's we price based on &#x2013; we are pricing based on CFR price in China back to Brazil, so freight is unimportant in our strategy.</p>
          <p>What we have been telling people about our shipping strategy, we're going to have as much ships we need in order to keep the freight differential as low as possible, which means that as close to the freight is &#x2013; to the spot freight is to the replacement cost. That will be the best provider. And we have to have a fleet that can support it.</p>
          <p>We now have -- now, we bought a lot of ships now, we have more than 20 ships being built for us. We bought a lot of existing ships. We have now a big fleet of ships that we own. And we also signed long-term contracts with a lot of ship owners to work for us. And for the time being, this strategy is working because the pressure on freight rate is very low. And we believe that in the future the pressure will be even lower when we get these new vessels entering in the market, okay. We have more than 20 being built now and from end of this year, we're going to start to get on average three or four months a new ship -- a new big ship coming.</p>
          <p>So again, the fleet will be as big as necessary to keep the freight differential as low as possible. And also we have another important issue is that to get on a quality basis, the VIU, enough money to eliminate the freight differential, okay. So one side, we want to have the freight differential as low as possible. And the other side we want to get a premium for our products that offset this advantage against our competitors that are nearby the Asia markets. So that's what I can tell you about our shipping strategy.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Thank you for the call. My first question is regarding the potential tax regime in Australia for the miners that's being discussed. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on the potential impact this measure could have on the iron ore industry going forward and also about the risk for higher taxes or royalties in Brazil. So please, if Martins can comment on this, that would be great. And also my second question is regarding iron ore volumes. We saw the shipments in this quarter were impacted by the heavy rainfall and maintenance works at Ponta da Madeira. So just to get a sense if these issues, mainly port issues, had been solved in the second quarter, because given that we saw success data out for April, which were weaker, just to get a sense on how the evolution for the second quarter volumes, iron ore volumes had been playing out? Those are the questions please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as for the tax, Martins, I don't know if you want to comment, but it was a surprise to market the way it was put. And not only the way, but the other dimension. This implies distortion in the industry of course, and we have to analyze very carefully, the extension and the dimension of the final outcome that will be discussed in the Australian Congress. Martins, I don't know if you want to make additional comments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think although this view affected the Australians, I think it is undesirable solution, because you know this kind of things give space for the same behavior in other countries. So I think the less tax we have in the industry, the better we'll be. So, and we hope that this tax system in Australia has to be discussed. It has to be passed with the Congress. And so you take a long way until it reaches the market, because as far as I know the system we're entering in July 2012, and I hope until July 2012 there will be a lot of challenges to make it more reasonable. We have some operations in Australia also, and all the mining industry in Australia will be affected, not only iron ore. So we see this as undesirable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And for the second quarter problems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the production problem, we have -- first, the rainy season was stronger than usually. Second, we have been ramping up production after we cut a lot of our production last year. We shut down a lot of mines, so it took some time to bring all of this in production. And also we have the rainy season and also you have big accident in Ponta da Madeira where we lost some conveyors and the port had stopped operating for almost four days. So all of these problems together reduced our volumes, but we believe that in the next quarter we can get a much better performance. And as far as our production is concerned, we are in condition to reach this year our full capacity as we plan it.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcos Assumpcao from Ita&#xFA;.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. First question is for Martins, if you could comment a little bit on the supply/demand drivers that are impacting, that's through the impact of spot prices in the second half, how you're seeing them that right now? You already mentioned you already commented on some of them, you mentioned that the Chinese demand should remain strong and also on the supply side. You don't believe that the Chinese will be able to increase a lot of domestic supply.</p>
          <p>I would ask if you could comment a little bit on the other factors like India and the rest of the world demand, in the supply and rest of the world demand and how you're seeing this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will have some factors increasing supply, but other factors also increasing demand, okay. If you look in the Western world, you have a stronger recovery, even in some countries in Eastern Europe you have some recovery. So less and less opportunity ore is available in the market.</p>
          <p>What I call opportunity ore is the ore that two years ago was devoted to the local market, and during the crisis this ore went to the other market. Even the States and Canada increased their exports of iron ore during this tough period, and as their economy are recovering and their industrial production is growing more and more the ore is becoming in their country. So this is a factor that is helping the market to be more bullish.</p>
          <p>Another factor is we don't have too many project coming on stream. It seems that FMG reached, their full capacity. They are not showing capacity to go above this level, CSN also. So the main projects that enter in the market in the last two years seems to be reaching their full capacity. I think &#x2013; and if you look at the big &#x2013; the big threes, they are also operating full capacity now, and I think the only additional ore that will come to the market is from Vale because last year we shipped below 250 million tons, which is much &#x2013; very below our normal capacity. So I think the biggest quantity of ore that will come to the market will come from Vale.</p>
          <p>In China, you now have the situation of the local ore that I also explained before. And in India, if you look in the next three months, you have the month in India which will reduce normally their shipment. And India market is growing, steel production is growing in India and more and more their ore will be devoted to the local market. So if you took all of these points, I would say to you that the market will continue to be very tight in the next six months. I do not see any easing in the market looking in the next six months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Hi, gentlemen. I've got two questions. The first question, just to follow up a little bit further on the pricing mechanism, thanks very much for all the detail you've provided so far. But if you could give us an idea, you may have mentioned something about grade, I had some issues with the call audibility earlier, but if you could give us an idea of the magnitude of the premium for the grade and impurities, lack of impurities? I'd like to understand that better. And you indicated this talk about a band mechanism, I'd like to learn a little bit more about that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the quality issue is that for each 1% additional iron content in the iron ore, the market now is paying between 5 and $6 per ton. So normally, the market's price is based on 62% iron ore. And for instance, Carajas iron ore, which is 66%, we are varying between 20 to $24 additional price based on quality, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the situation. The band is another mechanism we establish, a band of 5%. If the average market prices stay into the band in the next quarter, we don't have a price change, okay, only if the price variation goes above 5%. So that is the mechanism we agreed with our customers. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jose, also about the impurities as well, does that work in a similar way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because when we increase the iron content, on the other way around, you are reducing impurities, okay. So the more iron content you have in the ore, the less impurity you have, so that's how it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an automatic mechanism. But there is one point that we didn't factor in our price yet which is the low phosphorus content.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The low phosphorus content that we have in our ore, much lower than the average in the market is another source of value for customers. So, but it's more difficult to price it because there is not so transparent, and sometimes have to be fixed customer by customers, according to their product differential, the steel product differential they have that -- where the phosphorus content, you have a big impact.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe we could continue on the theme we just touched on in terms of the contaminants. When you're talking about the capturing the value in use premium, where are we in terms of having that recognized in contracts and should we assume that the current market indication of a $5.50 premium is something that we should expect you to start capturing on Carajas volumes in the second quarter, or is this still a work-in-progress in terms of discussions with clients? And then finally -- and then the other point would be just in relation to Simandou, have you got an indication of what sort of alumina content you're expecting there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, as far as the price system, this VIU system is already in place. From the second quarter on, our price will be based on the quality of our ore, so we are already getting this price -- quality differential in our price. And as far as Simandou ore is concerned, the ore there is very similar of Carajas ore, so the quality is 66%, some areas go after 67%, so it is very, very similar to Carajas and we will be priced accordingly the same way as we price Carajas now. Thank you very much.</p>
