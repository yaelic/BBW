      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Weber. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. That was quite a moving start in the year 2010 with earthquakes, storms and also other turbulences at the capital markets. We have quite a satisfying result of Munich Re for the first quarter with &#x20AC;485 million. We have a good result from our investments, which mitigates the losses from the national catastrophes, earthquakes and storms. And this led to a profit of 5.2% -- or high of 5.2%. However, our investment results will not be repeated during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Our equity was increased to &#x20AC;23 billion, despite our buyback program, buyback of our own shares. In the reinsurance, the high losses because of property-casualty were balanced out by better results in life insurance. Our primary insurance done by ERGO achieved a good result with &#x20AC;78 million.</p>
          <p>And now for the first time, we're also reporting on our youngest segment Munich Health. It is listed for the first time. We're still building up this segment and therefore the results are comparative-- comparatively small. Actually we have a negative result, a slight negative result.</p>
          <p>First I will talk about the consolidated results and then my colleagues will tell you the details of the individual segments. Now let's take a look at page five. The gross premiums written were increased by 12.4%. The upper end result we saw an increase by 4.6% and in the individual segments, reinsurance and primary insurance, we were quite happy with what we have achieved.</p>
          <p>In reinsurance, we saw a decrease of only &#x20AC;250 million. That is quite a moderate result since we had losses of &#x20AC;700 million due to natural catastrophes. About the development of the Munich Re share, just briefly, most of the time we go along and fluctuate with the market. The low volatility of the share is being appreciated more and more by investors. And when you look at the development since January 2008, you can see that during the financial crisis we have had a stable share price and we have also kept the distance to the other insurance companies, but we were also affected by the recent share price developments.</p>
          <p>For us it is quite important how the overall situation is developing. When you look at page seven, this is the DJ EURO STOXX 50 Price Index, which during the first quarter slightly moved upwards. The spreads on the right hand side, upper right-hand side here you can see this country spreads.</p>
          <p>In 2009 they converged downwards, towards the end of 2009 and also now especially during the first quarter and especially during April, we have seen an upward trend because of Greece, but also because of other European countries and their government bonds.</p>
          <p>When you look at corporate bonds at the bottom right hand side, it was not comparable, here the spreads continue on a downward trend and we profited from that with our portfolio. And when you look at bottom left, this is the risk free interest rate in the first quarter. The interest rates from German government bonds and also from the U.S. Treasury here the interest rates went down, but I will get back to that later.</p>
          <p>About the growth of our company, when you take a look at page number eight, we had slightly positive exchange rate effects despite the weak euro. And through the purchase of Hartford Steam Boiler at the end of 2008, beginning of 2009, this led to an increase of &#x20AC;149 million because Hartford Steam Boiler was only included in our books as of the second quarter 2009 and the same is true for other large reinsurance contracts, which were only listed in the second quarter of 2009 as well. And that's why we see here quite a dramatic increase in organic growth. Out of the 12 percentage points, nine are due to organic growth and this is especially true for life insurance and Munich Health.</p>
          <p>When you take a look at the overview on page nine, here we don't see any surprises either we see a clear plus in reinsurance life. However, when you take a look at property-casualty here, of course, the earthquakes as well as the storms left an effect. When you take a look at primary insurance, primary insurance life, primary insurance health in Germany but also primary insurance property-casualty here we see quite positive increases of our results.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have a well balanced investment portfolio and now on page 10 of the presentation, we have increased our equity shares carefully and especially during the last days you can see that the fixed interest rate markets also had an effect on the equity markets and that's what we are waiting for, before we want to increase our exposure here.</p>
          <p>84% of our portfolio is invested in fixed interest securities and what has happened here, we have made some changes here. Our corporate bonds, which we have built up in 2009, we reduced them, we have sold them off with profit partially and we also achieved some gains because of our government bonds, we have focused on a longer duration and our inflation-indexed securities, we have reduced them. And also we had some -- made some profits on selling other shares.</p>
          <p>We have kept our percentages of government bonds of the weaker states and I would now like you to take a look at page 11. On the left hand side, you see once more the overview of our portfolio; this is fixed income, a total of 681 -- &#x20AC;168 billion. And here on the right hand side, you can see how it is distributed across the different countries. We have on the one hand without policyholder participation here, for example for Germany, 7% of the government bonds are held by companies of the Munich Re Group, where we have no policyholders involved. This is a property-casualty and reinsurance life, whereas the life insurance primary -- from the primary insurance this is on the right hand side, here when you look at government bonds, here we look at 26% of our portfolio. So that means everything you see on the right hand side here we have a split. We have, one hand side where we have policyholders involved and the other side shareholders involved. And that means there is a certain buffer included.</p>
          <p>One word about Greece: as you know, we have about &#x20AC;2 billion worth of Greek government bonds. This amounts to about 3% of our government bond, overall government bond portfolio. And two fall into life insurance, primary insurance. 3% amounts to about 1% of our total capital investments. And as I said, that is something we can easily handle when you look at the overall size of our portfolio. However, I would like to point out that Germany and the U.S., here we have an overall amount of about 50% of our government bonds.</p>
          <p>And here we have a long duration. We have adhered to our policy of long duration, so that means that an interest rate increase, which we see when we look at the weaker countries are balanced or even over compensated through gains because of the low risk countries. And since we have this well balanced portfolio, it is quite a strong portfolio, we are not quite happy with some of the positions, but with the overall composition we are quite happy.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the result, overall result of our investment on page 12. Of the 5.2% return, 1.4% are due to gains from sold off investments that was corporate bonds, but also government bonds that is something that can -- is not necessarily sustainable, but this is the explanation that for the whole year we still expect an overall profit of slightly below 4%.</p>
          <p>On Page 13, if you would like to take a look, you'll see the positive development of the shareholders' equity of Munich Re and this is due to the good group results, consolidated results. Despite the high gains through our sale of investments, our shareholders' equity have increased and we have also profited from the exchange rate effects that means the weak euro.</p>
          <p>So much about consolidated figures from my side, I would now like to hand over to my colleague, Torsten Oletzky, who has the figures about primary insurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The primary insurance in Munich Re and I look back on a positive first quarter and increase of gross premiums written by almost 5% to 4.7 billion in the first quarter compared to the previous year period. Here we had on the combined ratio in the property-casualty segment with an increase in the first quarter of 96.3% to 98.7%. Here it has to be distinguished between the German business with 92.8%, in particular this was very positive since we had a very severe winter and the winter storm Xynthia was a great effect on this segment and international business was a bit weaker. I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the investment results, in primary insurance we had a positive -- very positive increase in the first quarter compared to previous year period. The investment result increased to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. And part of this increase was due to unit-linked life insurance and this had a positive effect on our results. The consolidated result in the primary insurance of Munich Re increased to 165 million from minus 59 in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>If we look at the figures of ERGO, the consolidated figures in the primary insurance segment, there was a positive increase. In 2009 we had a loss and here in the first quarter of this year we had a positive result of 78 million consolidate -- the consolidated result, this means that there is an increase of 106 -- of 60 million.</p>
          <p>So we are now moving on to page 15 or excuse me page 16 of the more detailed growth developments. You can see there that the development in the first quarter was due to organic changes. So we had an organic growth in the first quarter of &#x20AC;200 million and there was a slightly positive currency effect because of the weak euro and the result of this is that the foreign currencies resulted in a positive effect of about 50 million and we had additions in disposals and organic growth compared to the previous year results. So this did not exist in the previous year quarter.</p>
          <p>We take a look at the segments, the lower part of the chart you can see that growth in all segments existed. So in life and property-casualty and health in Germany we had a remarkable increase of the premiums written. You can see the results there and the increases in international business were higher than on the domestic market. We had also positive results in domestic market.</p>
          <p>If we look at the segments, it doesn't only make sense to look at the premiums written, but also the overall premium income. We are accounting according to IFRS not commercial code, so here we have the capitalization product included as well in the bottom right hand corner on page 16, you can see that the increase was about 9% when it comes to total premiums. So it was higher than the premiums written.</p>
          <p>On page 17, this brings me to the development of in the health business in Germany. We still see a trend away from the current premiums to single premiums, or actual premiums to single premiums. This is something that is not too welcome for us because the regular premiums and regular savings premiums is something that we want to continue, we want to maintain and we hope that the entire business or entire industry will be able to turn around this trend so that the regular premiums will increase.</p>
          <p>Again on the other hand not all single premiums are bad in themselves. If this is a business that's managed well, then you can gain a lot of money with these single premiums, this is what we do actually. You can see this in different segments of the single premiums we have, capitalization products and we're doing this through ERGO Direkt not in Hamburg-Mannheimer, not in Victoria Lim or ERGO Lim or ERGO Direkt. We have, high covered, there's no sideways subsidies in this business. So here, we also have a positive or good feeling so that the regular premiums -- in regular premiums we saw minus decrease and in single premiums an increase. You can see the detailed figures on chart 17 broken down to the German and international business. And the increase in regular premiums were 3.8% compared to in Germany in 2010 where there was a minus of 8%.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to have a look at the casualty-property segment on chart 18, here you can see the development of the combined ratio. And I also mentioned this before, the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2010 increased. The reasons for that were the winter storm Xynthia and very severe winter and the frost damages where water pipes broke and in Germany there was an increase that was only 1% when it comes to the combined ratio of 91.9 to 92.8, shows that we have the events under control and 2009 was a severe winter as well. So back then we had losses or damage from the winter before. But this shows, this figure again, which really shows that we have a very well managed business here.</p>
          <p>In international business, the combined ratios increased again. It's more than 100% now, so here the highest segment here is the Polish business and it was affected by the same events as in Germany. Poland had a very severe winter as well. So here the losses or damage events increased in the property-casualty segment. And it's definitely true that in single markets on an international level we have burdens on the financial and economic crisis that made our business more difficult and there is of course the need for action here and we have a lot of expertise on the international and German business here in the -- within the group and we're very confident that in international business we will be able to improve our performance, so that our property-casualty business will improve so much.</p>
          <p>On the figures maybe just a few words on the market trademark project we didn't include this in the presentation, but maybe some of you are interested in that. So all -- we are all within on time, within the time schedule, the distribution goes well. And by the third quarter, the risks carried on the distribution will be then under the name ERGO. And we will prepare everything over the short-term, so we are very confident that we will have a very positive launch of the new ERGO trademark on the market in the third quarter. And we're very confident that the results that we're hoping for will be achieved. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Good morning. My name is Torsten Jeworrek. I would like to start with chart 20, and I'm going to talk about the consolidated results of the reinsurance segment of Munich Re.</p>
          <p>On chart 20, you first of all see the gross premiums written, and you can see that reinsurance despite a very highly competitive market in 2010 achieved positive result when it comes to premiums written.</p>
          <p>The premiums for the reinsurance segment rose from 5.4 to 5.9% that was an increase of 10%. In the next chart, I will show you some of the reasons therefore when it comes to the technical results, and the profitability in our core business. Mr. Schneider also already mentioned that the first quarter for the reinsurance segment was characterized by very drastic natural catastrophes.</p>
          <p>For the reinsurance business, we had about 700 billion that we &#x2013; we had an earthquake in Chile; hailstorms in Australia, in Melbourne and Perth. And the winter storms since here in Europe, and 700 billion have been reserved for these events -- a million excuse me, 700 million. I just would like to mention that these events are part of the business model of the reinsurance. This is why our customers need the reinsurance product.</p>
          <p>The increasing number of natural catastrophes are not of great concern for me. Personally, what is important for me is that, for this capital intensive and highly volatile business that we calculate the exact or the adequate prices, so then we will have the adequate capacities for our customers. I would also like to mention that these natural disasters show us how important the role in society of the reinsurance is so that we can finance the rebuilding process. So these events are not of great concern to me. The investment results also in chart 20 increased by 60 million here in this context. Mr. Schneider already mentioned that there were write downs and realizations in the first quarter and they had a positive effect on these figures.</p>
          <p>On chart 21, I would like to talk about the development of the premium and if you take a look here, I said there was an increase of 10%, you can see that currency effects had some influence on that, but the main drivers were the investment at Hartford Steam Boiler. In the first quarter of 2010, which was consolidated for the first time into the first quarter and the organic growth mainly in the life business.</p>
          <p>This premium development is something that we can be very happy with because it reflect the fact that in a difficult market environment, here different segments interact and profitable growth is enabled and produced in such environments because these figures show two different effects. While the life business increase when it comes to premiums by almost 36% it was mainly the quarter share treaties that we made last year and the Asian business and property casualty almost maintained -- more or less maintained its premium so that on an overall level the premiums are increasing. But then property casualty you have another two effect, stability of premiums could only be achieved by acquiring Hartford Steam Boiler and on the other side we had price discipline and here the premiums, some premiums were given up, this is how we can explain these figures so there was a very positive development here. On the next chart you see the Non-Life segment on chart 22. Here you can see that there was a combined ratio comparison that we made here, so there was 109.2% of the combined ratio.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the influence of the 700 million reserves from natural catastrophes as I already said. And this block by itself happens as a burden of almost 21-percentage points on the combined ratio, which also leads to the forecast, damage forecast of 65 -- 6.5% of the non-life segment and this we will need some positive development or we will need to be lucky to achieve our annual forecast.</p>
          <p>The combined ratio that is below the basic premium closure is below and this shows that our price discipline had positive effects in this context. The Nazdach business in itself, as I already mentioned in several instances, is a core business for Munich Re. I believe that we have the highest capacities on the worldwide market in this segment and we are prepared to further expand and pass on these capacities at adequate prices then we can have a positive result in this segment. And this is one of the most profitable segments in the reinsurance segment.</p>
          <p>This brings me to chart 23. Just briefly I would like to mention the renewals as per first of April. April 1 is one of the renewal dates for our contract business in the non-life segment. This is one of the -- as the first of April, about 10% in the reinsurance segment is renewed on first of April. The volume below -- behind this was &#x20AC;1.1 billion. The renewed markets are Japan, Korea 485 and U.S. &#x20AC;396 million and then we have the Asian markets.</p>
          <p>The market environment that we experienced by the April renewals were similar to what we have seen in January. So in all business lines we had sufficient capacities or even more than sufficient, which led to the fact that we had moderate priced pressure in almost all segments. An exception was capital intensive catastrophe business and credit business where we had -- we could implement good prices as in January, we had a strict price discipline, so you can see in the upper chart so the price friction so to speak was minus 2.1% or 0.2%, which had an effect on our figures.</p>
          <p>The next renewal period will be to allow U.S., the Caribbean and Australia and for that segment right now we expect that the trend on the market will be similar. It's hard to assess it right now, but we'll have to see to what extent natural catastrophes will have an influence. We've seen lately that the industry has a high -- effectively high losses based on the oil platform disaster that we've seen, the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe. So the South American catastrophe business and then the transport business. So there will be significant price increases due to these events.</p>
          <p>We at Munich Re will certainly use -- seize all the opportunities involved in that with these events and we will adhere to our price discipline and we will be prepared to reduce our prices if necessary. Thank you very much. I'll pass the floor to Mr. Strassl.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Wolfgang Strassl is my name and I'm today for the first time will introduce you to the new business segment Munich Health. And before I get to the figures, let me just say something about this business segment. Why do we become so active in the worldwide health market? Munich Health was fully established in May last year and on slide 25, you can read the main reasons, which led to our decision to establish Munich Health. When you look at the International health market, you can see that the worldwide expenditures have been growing for many years and will most likely continue to do so and they were always above the growth of the GDP.</p>
          <p>And another development is that private health expenditures are even above so we can see a shift here towards more privatization and more liberalization of the health sector. In some markets that is also continued by a trend towards the other direction at sometimes, but when you look at the long-term figures, the structural trend is quite obvious. The reason for this particular growth are quite well known, what we just mention the four most important ones. Of course we have the demographic trends, we have an overall population growth, but also an increase in longevity and then in mature markets, but also in threshold countries and developing countries we see huge advances in the field of medical technology, medical treatment, medical diagnosis, things which were unthinkable years ago and this will continue -- this trend will continue and will lead to more possibilities, but also to more expenses obviously.</p>
          <p>Then we also see an increase in the developed countries in our first world that people focus more on their health. At the same time, we see unhealthy lifestyles which leads to the typical diseases such as obesity, which is just one prominent example. And then finally, the increasing wealth in the fast-growing threshold countries leads to improvements in wages and health -- wealth, it leads to more expenditure for health.</p>
          <p>For the new business segment and that gets me to slide 26, wants to tap into these growth markets that is the one -- that is one important reason, but also synergies which we see within the group, which we have not fully realized yet, we want to focus on these synergies now. And that was the reason why Munich Health was established as the third. However, still relatively small segment, apart from the two segments we already have, which are quite large namely reinsurance and primary insurance.</p>
          <p>Munich Health includes all business models, which we have already been working on in the health market. That means primary insurance, reinsurance, but also what's important is so called health management or risk management services, which we provide for our customers. And this integration of the management responsibilities across all segments under one roof enables us to seize the opportunities in the best possible way in the health market. And apart from that we can also profit from strategical synergies and bundle our efforts. We see a still fragmented situation in the health market, but we are now, as I said, bundling our efforts in order to tap into these markets become stronger and more profitable in this segment.</p>
          <p>On page 27, we have a few explanations listed about our current situation and also the decisive success factors. We calling ourselves as a specialist provider in this niche for health risks and we don't want to do reinsurance and primary insurance only, but we want to offer a holistic concept for this particular market. Let's take a look at the volume. We have seen quite a substantial growth last year; I will get back to that. But the figures for 2009 show a premium volume to the tune of four billion.</p>
          <p>Through bundling or through bringing together all the health experts under the roof of Munich Health that means we have a pool of 5,000 employees, which are well trained, we are close to the market, close to our customers and were presented at 26 locations internationally. We are not only managing this business from our location in Munich, but also we take a decentralized approach by five regional profit centers, two of which are located in Munich. However, the majority namely, three: one is in Princeton, another one in Abu Dhabi, and the third one is located in Singapore.</p>
          <p>What do we want to achieve through bundling our efforts? Since we brought together all the experts and all the business models for the global health market under one roof and we can manage it strategically now that will enable us to provide specific expertise, specific competence and that will be decisive for us as a global provider.</p>
          <p>So services, the fact that we cover the whole market also enables us that we use the expertise and the knowledge from one market and apply it in an intelligent fashion in another market. And it also increases our competence in terms of innovation and also the ability for flexible business models, which can be adjusted to market and customer needs. And it means we have tailor-made solutions, which are quite important especially when you talk about partnerships with governmental institutions for example when you think of PPPs, public private partnerships.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at slide number 28. As I already mentioned, last year we have seen quite a substantial increase in our premiums. That was possible through large reinsurance contracts, which allowed our customers to take the burden off their own capital base. And here because of the financial crisis, we have seen opportunities, because a large number of our customers especially in North America but also in Asia and similar to our colleagues in life insurance and reinsurance, some of our colleagues saw that their capital bases eroded and that reinsurance strengthened their solvency.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the technical results at the upper right. We cannot be happy with the results you can see. However, this is strongly characterized by the fact that during the past years, we have been quite active in primary insurance in threshold countries; potential markets such as China, India, but also in Italy. And here we're still in the ramp up phase and that means we still are facing the corresponding costs and therefore our combined ratio is slightly above 100%.</p>
          <p>Let me also mention that with our new segment, we're on the right track to deliver on our promises that we will be a leading provider for risk management solutions globally. Core activities are the consolidation of existing business and also the full establishment of the new organization. That means especially the realization of the success factors and synergies, which have been created through our new structure and setup. But it also, it means that we have to realize potentials, we have to attack them in a focused way.</p>
          <p>We again want to concentrate on threshold countries, and let me just -- India -- mention India as an important example, but also others. And apart from that we also see opportunities for reinsurance and there is an increasing demand also for reinsurance. But we also want to increase our profitability and want to get to an expected level, and here a number of product and process optimizations are necessary, but we are working on that and we are well positioned and we will continue to grow and grow profitably in this globally growing health market. Thank you so much.</p>

          <p>Well thank you, Mr. Strassl. This is J&#xF6;rg Schneider once more. Now let me give you an outlook for the overall year 2010. Let me continue where Mr. Strassl left off. If you take a look at the bottom of the page 31, we have seen a quite positive growth and we don't expect any red figures for the overall year. Well we have an ambitious growth for ERGO. We want to achieve a combined ratio of below 95% and that is something we will achieve despite the difficult start in the winter. There is always a greater effect of problems in winter.</p>
          <p>In reinsurance, we have to focus on the combined ratio. We want to achieve the target of 97%. This is consistent with our overall profits for the group. Nevertheless we need to take into account, we have anticipated about 6.5% from losses from national catastrophes as my colleague Mr. Jeworrek said. 5% have already incurred during the first quarter so we've already spent that money so to speak, we do not -- the storms of the coming quarters do not know of the storms of the first quarter. So we don't see any connection here. So we need a bit of luck here in order to see fewer losses and achieve our target of 97%. But we should not go for a new target, we should adhere to our target.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our overall investments. We have had a good start in the first quarter. I have explained which gains we have made through sales. We have been -- we have done a successful re-shifting of our portfolio. We have not done that just for the profit and loss effect. However, we need to expect an effect of the low interest during the next quarter, so we might not achieve our expectations of 4%.</p>
          <p>Gross premiums written, we expect about 43 to &#x20AC;45 billion, just a few weeks ago we expected about 41 to 43. So that is a significant increase of our growth forecast and that is due to exchange rate effects partially and through the positive development in life and health reinsurance.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the consolidated result of 2010. In our Annual Report we said that we expect to make the two billion barrier, but it will not happen by itself because at the time the earthquakes of February and storms had already taken place. Now we're faced with Deepwater Horizon, the oilrig damage. So we still have a negative effect of the major losses. So we do not want to give up our goal of two billion for the overall year, but it is quite ambitious.</p>
          <p>Our -- for the RORAC, we still have a target of achieving 15%. Therefore it is important that we work sustainably. We still focus on a balanced investment portfolio and in no scenario we will be the best performers necessarily. But we are able to cope with the more negative overall situation. Now let me just mention quickly share buyback. We have decided that we will continue our share buyback program until the AGM 2011 to the tune of up to &#x20AC;1 billion. We have quite a positive equity situation and all our shareholders will profit from the buyback. And because of the solid -- our solid position and despite the buyback we can also seize opportunities for profitable growth.</p>
          <p>This brings us to the end of our conference and we're looking forward to your questions.</p>

          <p>The first question is from Oliver Suess by Bloomberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm interested 109.2% in reinsurance combined ratio. Since when does -- did you achieve this figure? When was last -- when was last time that this combined ratio was as high, and I've got another question with the major loss events in the first month. How much has been of the capacity has been used up in the first quarter and when will the share buyback be reinitialized? Is it then still possible to achieve a merger or takeover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mr. Schneider. Mr. Suess, first of all when it comes to the combined ratio, in 2005 was last time that we had the storms Katrina, Wilma, and so forth and they had a combined ratio of 111.7 in 2005. And in the third quarter especially it was almost at the same level as to right now and the budget for the major losses is used up to a large extent so the net cap budget, the major losses for personal hazards was quite high as well. So they are not very interesting growth opportunities that our capitalization is very solid. So we can buy shares and currently we are interested to grow due to acquisitions, but we do not see sufficient possibilities of prices for companies representing economic environment and reflect this environment. So for the time being, there will be no major acquisitions, but we are prepared to do it if the situation changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said the budget has been used up to a large extent, what does this mean exactly? Is this more than 90%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first quarter, it was 4.1% of the 6.5% and then there was the oil platform disaster and if everything develops well as it happened over the past few years in some quarters then we'll still have a positive outlook. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now the next question by Uzi Kasell of Dow Jones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have -- I would like you to explain once again the growth premium written process, what are the currency relations here and the premiums, when it comes to premiums in the life segment, I thought that the new Munich Health segment would be accounted by the Munich Health Reinsurance and that it would -- is it higher therefore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mr. Schneider again. The fact is that these premium forecasts done in such a way and we assume that the foreign currency effect at the focused date would remain the same for the entire year and the euro lost some ground compared to the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and the Swiss francs and the British in the pound sterling. And compared to the pound the fluctuation is not as large as compared to the U.S. and Canadian dollars. And therefore the increases will be about 5% when it comes to the currency effect at the forecast date.</p>
          <p>And we see that the major effect of the quota share contracts at the beginning of 2008, it happened at the beginning of 2009 and still the volumes, it develops in a very positive way, especially in the life reinsurance and health reinsurance segments. So this is the main reason, but Ms. Dow we determine this gross premium -- we do not -- we'll see it as the core element. We look at the bottom line and these quarter share contracts have not the respective or adequate spreads, the spreads are quite low, but compared to other companies that have negative effects due to weak dollar, you are benefiting from the weak euro. Yes, this is true as long as we have a surplus. But once the losses are higher than the premiums the whole thing turns round. So but of course it is supposed to be that way, but we have foreign sales that are much, very appreciated, very high and our spreads makes us more competitive abroad. We are exporters so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have the second question, the ECB President Trichet said yesterday that, the ECB will not buy euro government bonds. What is your reaction to that and how do you see that? Do you have a neutral view of that? I believe right now it's quite positive because it's not indicated to do that. Could you please explain that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is very difficult. We all read the newspapers, we all have our own opinions. We are all expert economists and we believe that the measures that are taken right now to stabilize situation in Greece, that if the things go well in Greece and this will be sufficient for the time being and of course it will be better not to take out any additional options. So it is important that we're acting decidedly and decisively. And I believe on the Greek side, Greek took the necessary measures as well. And these measures are hopefully accepted in our society. And we hope that not just a small minority is destroying the whole positive feeling and I believe that many European countries have introduced very decisive measures. This might -- maybe should have happened a bit earlier, but we believe that the situation has been now under control. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question by Sebastian Jost. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a few question to Mr. Schneider. When it comes to Greece, Munich Re takes part in the financial sector support that was adopted in Berlin, could you tell us something more about your participation? And your reduced inflation-indexed bonds, does this mean that Munich Re is not concerned by inflation or this is a tactical step? And the third question the gains on disposals, what is in the pipeline here in this context and are there some effects of the portfolio restructuring? So what was the development here in the first quarter? And I've got another question to Mr. Jeworrek, with regard to Deepwater Horizon. Do you -- maybe can you make a more detailed assessment on the total losses on the insured loss, you already mentioned some figures, but you always hear that some large extent is covered by self-insurance of the company. So what is the burden for the reinsurers in this context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Jost. I will just start again. Munich Re takes part in the stabilization program for Greece. This is something that goes without saying that we do that and we do this in such a way that over the next three years, we will not again put our expiring Greece bonds back on the market. But the volume of these expiring bonds will be maintained as a concerted action here and I do not as one of the participants give a comprehensive overview. This is actually I believe the task of the Federal Government and the consortium as a whole. I think this is a very sensible thing that is going on right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will you then still sell your bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our exposure, we'll maintain -- when these bonds expire then we will roll these forward. When it comes to inflation-linked bonds, this is a quite interesting question. We do not have the total inflation cover or hedges, but we're trying to have the same trend in liabilities and our portfolio and this can happen by inflation-linked bonds, but the market is very small here. There was very few high quality instruments and from a technical point of view these were bit too high and you said it from a technical point of view, we are maintaining our inflation hedges by increasing our equity backing ratio, the -- gains on disposals result from restructuring gains, but there can also be restructuring losses.</p>
          <p>We will not shy away from realized losses in profit and loss. The income statement is the resilience of our capital investment portfolio would be supported through that. So we're looking at it from an economic point of view and we can afford to not do everything based on the profit and loss figures alone. And I'm very happy that we have this leeway and we can explain to our investors why we are taking these losses. And currently we have unrealized gains of almost &#x20AC;6 billion. So in this context, I do not believe we have to have any concerns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to elaborate on the complexity of the Deepwater Horizon claims and why is it difficult to talk about an overall sum. At this point in time, what is quite clear there is a damage to the platform itself. Damage has occurred and the platform was quite a new technology so you cannot say, it was sloppily done. So $568 million and here $80 million US for Munich Re. So this is -- this needs to be paid out. And here at this point, the complexity starts. We're not talking about one company only, which was doing the drilling.</p>
          <p>We had several companies involved. The company Transocean, which did the drilling and owns the platform and then as a consortium of three companies, the largest of which is BP, which is there, together they're the exploring consortium. And here we have to figure out who is going to pay for what damages and there is removal of wreck policy in place. So there is a policy for the recovery of the platform. However, nobody will recover the platform from a depth of over 1,000 meters. Then, from an insurance point of view, we have a suit and labor policy and the question is what you do with the claims of the workers, of the employees, which died during the incident and who were injured during the incident.</p>
          <p>The largest part of which is not clear are the issues of liability -- also liability in terms of environmental pollution. Who is going to pay for the damage that's caused by the spilt oil and here you pointed out the so-called self-insurance, that is something that refers especially to BP. BP doesn't buy any insurances, they insure it themselves, but what the situation is between BP and the other members of the consortium and also we do not know what the claims will be in terms of liability and it will take quite a bit of time. So this liability part that is the most problematic part, which makes an estimation quite difficult. However, all the liability policies which are in place, they're all limited. And that's why we have decided that we assume the $80 million US for the damages to the platform, that is something we have to live with. And we expect the other losses to be in the low three digit millions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall damage for us is limited to a low three digit million figure. That includes the 80 million I mentioned for the platform.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>And that gets us to our next question from Christian Kraemer from Reuters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I have two or three short questions. The pigs states, you talked about the percentage figures, can you repeat that in absolute figures because you only gave us the percentage figures and then about the capital markets after the last lively days at the stock markets. What would be the result if we were to look at the first five to six weeks of the second quarter. So much from my side. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Kramer, if you could please repeat your second question? After the first four months, which current situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No I'm look -- I want to look at a couple market results now after the past few turbulent weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first about the government bonds of the countries, Portugal, 0.8 billion, Italy about 5 billion, Ireland 2.5 billion, Greece about 2 billion and Spain also about, slightly below 2 billion, just roughly. So at the end of the year we had about 60% of the government bonds, but which means only 45% of our fixed interest rate portfolio so that is something we can definitely handle very well.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at the performance of the stock markets in April -- excuse me, the situation in April when it comes to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain. Here we have a negative performance because the risk premium has increased. If we isolate that and look at the performance of the year 2009 then we're ending up with a zero.</p>
          <p>However, we have realized gains when it comes to our German government bonds and that balances -- that kind of balances us out during the year 2010. So from the one group we have made about the same amount of losses, which we had gained on the other side so that is something that shows the strength of our overall portfolio. So we're not making any large bets here. We will not come off as the winners in one of the scenarios, but we will also not be hit too hard by the scenario. Does that answer your question, Mr. Kraemer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To a certain extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I cannot give you a daily update on our progress, of course we do have that, but there is no reason for us to worry. Things are running well. I don't want people to speculate, I don't want people to expect that our investment results for the overall year will be around 5% that is not something that I expect. Especially when it comes to our asset managers we want them to be able to act by always keeping the best interest of the company in mind. They can also realize losses if it makes sense from a market point of view. Can I -- ?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>I have a follow-up question. You &#x2013; Die Allianz wanted a governmental regulation for short selling, what is your opinion about that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is not that easy because from the statistical data it is hard to prove. The development of the real markets and the derivative markets they go in parallel at times, but the derivatives often have an influence on the real markets, but I can only compare with Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> when it comes to the trend, we can not only fight with the consequences, we actually should tackle certain speculative excesses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a question about the recent Solvency II regulations. It is said that the situation for the insurance companies in Europe will become easier compared to the regulations in place last year. So is Solvency positive for the new business of Munich Re?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Gold for your question. Solvency II is of extreme importance for Munich Re because it is a total change in the regulation. The project is due to run for about 10 years with its pre-cursors and it's not getting in its decisive phase and we expect the major decision to be taken this year and next year and it will be then fully implemented by January 1, 2013. And until then the supply and demand side in the insurance and reinsurance business will become obvious.</p>
          <p>We have the final advice by Z.I.A.D., the major organization here. They came up with factors for the necessary capital for insurance companies and they took a very way too conservative approach from our point of view. And we have criticized that together with all the other insurance companies. Now the EU commission in a close dialog with Z.I.A.D. together with the member states and together with the insurance companies, they have come up with their quantitative impact study five, a study where the insurance companies are meant to be -- we're participating and now we have some calibration factors included here, which we would see as a reasonable draft for the future.</p>
          <p>Solvency II regulation and this over compensation element have been taken out and overall it looks quite reasonable by now. And now the capital requirements for the insurance companies will increase but it -- they will increase at the right places because despite significant risks not a lot of capital was required in the past. But it is all quite reasonable for the reinsurance company like Munich Re it is nevertheless a good, a positive development because that will lead to, because we're hoping for more potential business, but we will see the development over the course of next year. I don't want to go into details here, because it is a very technical topic.</p>
          <p>However, things are moving in the right direction and I would like to say to all parties concerned especially the regulatory authorities that this is going to be pushed through because so much work has gone into that and it will be no better protection against further crisis than implementing finally Solvency II, with its implications. So that means that you expect just as before that you see good opportunities, business opportunities on the reinsurance side through Solvency II. So that means not fewer business, not less business because of the changes of the commission and so on and so forth. What we never believed that some of the ideas would be fully implemented. But Mr. Jeworrek could say something.</p>
          <p>We believe that Solvency II and its current state, which will most likely be implemented. That it will be for us it will give us good business opportunities for three reasons. The basic calibration leads to more necessary capital and a good thing about it is that you cannot take on some risks. Secondly, a diversification across several industries or regions. Diversification is seen as something positive and that means you have to be more diversified from a customer point of view. And thirdly, the reinsurance, because of Solvency II, will be seen as an alternative instrument in order to replace capital and not the situation like we have seen in the past. And many consultants in the market they are preparing for that, they are focusing on remodeling of the reinsurance sector and that's why we see good opportunities with our worldwide diversified portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two brief questions. The volume of the Greece support, you do not -- something that you do not want to mention in detail? And the second question: why was the yearly target not questioned at the AGM? Then we have the impression that there was not a problem at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Kraemer or Mr. Fontbonne said very explicitly that two billion will be difficult and we did not leave this behind, we adhered to this target. If you have such large major losses, well there might be some effects. When it comes to the combined ratio there the skepticism is even more increased because this affects the non-life reinsurance. We've got a very diversified business portfolio and it can happen that some segments are performing better than others.</p>
          <p>And when it -- on the topic of the AGM, I'm quite sure, I'm actually absolutely sure that the statement of today does not really differ from the statement at the AGM, but generally have good performance.</p>
          <p>The investment portfolio of course is -- when it comes to the volume of the Greece -- support program for Greece is something that I do not want to mention any details because the details are being discussed by the Federal Government and the banks that are involved and this is being reconciled between the Government and the banks right now. And you have to keep in mind that this is European consorted action. What is important right now is that the large investors not just, you know retreat from this involvement and I believe that the volumes that have to be provided by the large investors might lead to price fluctuations if they all do it at the same time, at the same volume. So we do have no concerns with regard to the Greece portfolio.</p>
          <p>If there are no further questions, I thank everybody involved and maybe if you want to, you can listen to the Analyst Conference at 2:30, the next date is the 4th of August.</p>
