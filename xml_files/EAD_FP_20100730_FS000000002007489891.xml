          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the EADS Conference Call on the H1 Earnings 2010. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for questions following the introduction.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the floor over to your host Louis Gallois, Hans Peter Ring, and Nathalie Errard.</p>

          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the EADS H1 earnings 2010 conference call. Louis Gallois, our CEO, and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour and 15 minutes. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also webcast with set of special banner for H1 earnings 2010. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was emailed to you this early morning with slides, which we will now go through, and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now, to Louis Gallois.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, everyone, to today's call. The timing of this call comes at a most interesting time for our company. As most of you know, for several months now we have been seeing a progressive upturn in the globalization market. The commercial results of Q2 reflect that picture to some degree. At the Farnborough Air Show, we and our friends of Boeing bought asserted greater confidence in the sustained market upturn.</p>
          <p>We had a strong showing in commercial record sales with commitments of 255 aircrafts valued at more than USD 28 billion supported by emerging countries and vessels returning to the market. Hence, we are able to take our order intake guidance up to from &#x2013; up from 250 to 300 aircraft in 2010 to above 400, driven by strong demand for both singular and wide-body aircraft. This development is especially encouraging in view of our goal to improve profitability in our Airbus unit.</p>
          <p>The progress made in existing programs, particularly the creative also raises confidence in our profitability going forward. So, commercial prospects for our space businesses also remain quite strong. If there is a grey area it's &#x2013; it is civil helicopters and defense.</p>
          <p>In defense, our global sales picture remains pretty strong when we look outside of Europe, but we continue to look at the different spending environment in Europe with concern. These issues goes beyond commercial interest. It is vital that Europe remains a pillar of global stability. And it can only play this strategic role with strong defense industry production infrastructure and well-equipped military and security forces. Hence, we would hope that the various European government will appreciate and support this vital need.</p>
          <p>Now let us turn to our H1 highlights, but before we do, have a close look at our Safe Harbor statement.</p>
          <p>Page four, we are seeing clear signs of improvement in the commercial aircraft enrollment as I said, when we'd go in both passenger and freighter markets. This trend has been confirmed by Airbus commercial success at Farnborough which exceeded expectations.</p>
          <p>We do not see the same recovery in the helicopter markets. Delivery and backlog levels confirm momentum and once again we are increasing single-aisle production rates from 36 at the end of the year 2010, to 38 in Q3 2011, and up to 40 amount in Q1 2012.</p>
          <p>250 commercial aircraft were delivered to customers in the first half, as well as 249 helicopters. Ariane 5 recorded its 37th consecutive launch success for us in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The A400M flight program is progressing better than expected with the third aircraft now added to the campaign. However, the development of the flight management system is on the critical path with more challenges than expected.</p>
          <p>Risk mitigation actions are being undertaken. We are still working towards the contract amendments. Management assumptions taken for the provision calculation remain valid.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of July, EADS North America submitted the bid for the U.S. Air Force Tanker and we continue to fight to win for these contracts. A brief comment before as we do, we will focus on the financials in more detail on page six. Our strong net cash position of &#x20AC;8.9 billion after free cash flow consumption and pension contributions of around &#x20AC;300 million in the first half continues to provide a solid foundation for operational needs, as well as future growth and reasonable acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Customer financing needs for the first half reached around &#x20AC;300 million at last reported a net income for the half was &#x20AC;185 million. And now I give the floor to Hans Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, from my side as well. I will now lead you through H1 financial highlights. This is on page six. The percentage of completion methodology was resumed on the A400M program based on the allocation of internal milestones.</p>
          <p>This has resulted in revenues of around &#x20AC;300 million being booked on the program in the first &#x2013; in the second quarter. The EBIT before one-off stands at around &#x20AC;640 million for EADS and around &#x20AC;260 million for Airbus. It benefited from good performance in Airbus legacy programs and our other business activities.</p>
          <p>Compared to 2009, EBIT before one-off was weighed down by the deterioration of hedge rates and higher R&amp;D investments. Order intake for the half was significantly above the 2009 level due to a higher level of commercial aircraft orders at Airbus and the big A380 order.</p>
          <p>Our order book stands at a robust &#x20AC;454 billion reflecting increases at Airbus Industrial. The Airbus commercial backlog benefited from the positive revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;56 billion due to the U.S. dollar closing spot rate that has significantly strengthened since year-end and it was from 1.44 to 1.23.</p>
          <p>On slide seven we can look at the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is 3.2% at group level. At Airbus, good underlying performance of the single aisle and long range aircraft is weighed down by the A380 by roughly the same amount as last year as it was expected and as we've told you already.</p>
          <p>The quarter roughly &#x20AC;70 million of negative one-time effects has been booked. In Eurocopter the program charge and margin adjustment of around &#x20AC;50 million has been booked against the NH90 reflecting the continued technical complexity on the program.</p>
          <p>The restructuring charge of &#x20AC;40 million resulting from the implementation of the shape program, which is the Eurocopter restructuring and transformation program, as well as a positive impact from the recognition of a technical milestone on the Korean utility helicopter program further one-off effects.</p>
          <p>At Airbus, the majority of one-time effects are linked to the recent volatility in foreign exchange. EADS has further refined its natural hedging strategy in line with IFRS, impacting reported EBIT in other financial results, but there was no impact on EBIT before one-off and net income.</p>
          <p>For further information regarding these mitigating actions, I would like to refer you to the annex in the slides 21 and 22.</p>
          <p>The volatility of the U.S. dollar drove reassessment of the compounded rate used to revalue commercial loss-making contracts, if the volatility of the dollar continued. The update to the compounded rate has resulted in a positive impact of around &#x20AC;40 million. The revaluation of the A400M provision has triggered a negative impact of around &#x20AC;150 million linked to dollar purchases.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the net impact results in a negative amount of around &#x20AC;110 million. The PDP mismatch and balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our results by around &#x20AC;100 million this half.</p>
          <p>Going to slide eight now, R&amp;D rose versus last year driven by increases in Airbus due to a ramp-up in the A350 activity, as well as an increase in product investment in DS and Eurocopter.</p>
          <p>The interest result reflects the decline in interest rates on the financial markets. A large part of this line is related to interest for refundable launch investments. Meanwhile, the other financial result improved considerably by around &#x20AC;270 million year-on-year.</p>
          <p>This line includes the positive revaluation of our U.S. dollar and British pound cash assets. Another main deviation, compared to last year comes from the 2009 negative revaluation of the options lost. In the first quarter 2010, we completed the restructuring program.</p>
          <p>As we implemented more options in our hedge portfolio going forward, we can expect further effects in this line from the revaluation of these option premiums paid. This line also includes the unwinding of discounted provisions. The tax rate for the year is 32% as expected.</p>
          <p>On the hedging portfolio, to update with this we come to slide 9. There you can see that during the first half we took advantage of the recent strengthening of the dollar by increasing the pace of our hedging activities at more attractive rates without collateralization. $9.4 billion of hedges matured in H1 at a rate of 1.34. $20.6 billion of hedge contracts were added at an average rate of as well $1.34 per euro. Our hedge book increased from $60.8 billion at the end of '09 to $70.1 billion at the end of June 2010.</p>
          <p>The strengthening dollar improved profitability beyond 2012. However, in the short-term, our net exposure is fully hedged. Meanwhile, the strengthening of the dollar, the resulting mark-to-market volatility, and the size of the portfolio, limits the availability of hedging capacity for forward contracts. Addressed deterioration of the euro value against the dollar would lead to difficulties to find count of parties for the hedging of forward contracts and could weigh further on equity.</p>
          <p>At the end of June the market value of our hedge book is a negative &#x20AC;6.2 billion at a closing dollar rate of 1.23. It weighs on equity net of tax by &#x20AC;4.2 billion. As current hedges expire and order dollar weakens, this impact will reverse. During the second quarter 2010, EADS invested in foreign exchange options, as well as forward contracts. Options consume less hedging capacity while allowing for a potential upside from more favorable rates.</p>
          <p>As with the options purchased during 2009 the premium paid has been capitalized and changes in time value will be recognized in the other financial result. Quarterly rates for 2010 are provided on page 27 in the annex. As you know, we suffer significantly this year from hedge rate deterioration. Actually in the first half we talked about $0.12.</p>
          <p>Up to our cash flow on slide 10, as expected, we consumed free cash flow this half versus 2009. The change in growth cash flow from operations comes from the lower EBIT before one-off which we have already explained. The change in working capital reflects, as anticipated, an increase in inventories, mainly at Airbus, also at a much lower level than in H1 2009.</p>
          <p>H1 2009 included a ramp-up on the 380, but the low level of A380 deliveries, as well as a miss-match between production and delivery rates for both single high and long range. The inflow of advantage linked to Airbus commercial activity is higher than one year ago, representing the increase in commercial aircraft orders.</p>
          <p>Some payment delays in the defense and institutional business were compensated by government receipts from development programs. The level of customer financing needs for the half reached around &#x20AC;270 million.</p>
          <p>Investing activities consumed around &#x20AC;800 million, reflecting an increase in capital expenditure mainly as investment ramped up on the 350 program. The 2009 figure included a cash flow from the sale of certain aero structures.</p>
          <p>This year EADS decided on a cash contribution to pension assets of around &#x20AC;300 million, which impacts net cash, but not free cash flow. Now, Louis will talk you through the performance of the Airbus division in more detail on page 12.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Airbus delivered good commercial results in the first half of 2010. 117 net from commercial orders were booked, including an order for 32 additional A380 from Emirates during our Berlin air show in June. Of course, these figures does not include the firm orders of Farnborough that I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>250 aircraft were delivered at Airbus commercial to the end of June, including seven A380, which 10 A380 delivered as of today. We are on a good track to deliver at least 20 this year.</p>
          <p>As expected, the program is stabilizing and we are making significant progress on the learning curve. Of the 250 deliveries, five single-aisle aircraft were delivered on their operating lease and thus, do not count for revenue and margin recognition.</p>
          <p>Fourteen cancellations were registered towards the end of June, compared to 22 in the same period last year. The commercial backlog stands at 3,355 aircrafts or &#x20AC;385.7 billion. The order book benefited from a positive valuation impact of around &#x20AC;56 billion due to the strengthening value of the U.S. dollar against the euro at the end of June versus December 2009. To see 295 military aircraft orders were booked for Mexico. In the second quarter, nine deliveries were made until the end of June.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 13, compared to a year ago, Airbus revenues reflect lower volumes, but the favorable mix effect which includes a higher number of A380 deliveries. The negative impact from foreign exchange is around &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>The Airbus commercial EBIT reflects the small pricing improvement net of escalation in the second quarter. However, the bulk of the pricing improvement should come in the second half.</p>
          <p>Negative foreign exchange effects weighted on EBIT by around &#x20AC;0.5 billion versus one year ago and R&amp;D increased driven by ramp-up in investment of the A350 program. A350 development is progressing, but remains challenging. A380 continues to weigh on the underlying performance. Airbus military revenues benefited from an increasing volume from both tanker activity and medium light deliveries.</p>
          <p>A series of internal milestones have been established on the A400M program as part of the return to the percentage of completion methodology. Three revenue milestones were passed during the second quarter, which have triggered revenues of around &#x20AC;300 million, in line with the level of revenues we booked in the H1 2009 when the program was treated in the early stage method of accounting. A corresponding portion of costs have been recognized in the profit and loss with the difference covered by the loss-making contract provision.</p>
          <p>Airbus military EBIT reflects positive volume and mix effects on the underlying business. However, on the A400M program, a negative currency effect of &#x20AC;446 million, and the recovery of fixed costs of &#x20AC;30 million wait on the positive result.</p>
          <p>Now, Hans Peter will take you through the other divisions beginning with Eurocopter on slide 14.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis. Eurocopter net orders reached 140 in the first half in line with the first half 2009. The cancellation trend is slowing with 27 cancellations to the end of June, compared to 59 for the same period last year. But the commercial market remains uncertain, with demand still far below 2007, '08 levels.</p>
          <p>249 helicopters were delivered in the first half, including 13 NH90 and Tiger, 10 more than in H1 2009. Most of the expected decline in deliveries anticipated for 2010 is now shifted to 2011 due to the low level of orders this year.</p>
          <p>Progress is being made on NH90 program. In the second quarter, the first 2 NH90 naval versions were delivered in Step A configuration, one each to France and the Netherlands. Oman received its first two TTH on time.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth of 11%, compared to last year is driven by higher volumes, favorable phasing of support revenues, and milestone progress on the Korean Utility Helicopter. EBIT declined 28%, compared to the '09 level. The favorable volume and mix was offset by a charge and margin adjustment on the NH90 program for around 50 million, a restructuring charge of &#x20AC;40 million for the implementation of the transformation and cost-saving program, SHAPE, as well as higher product investment. A positive one-time effect was also booked linked to a technical milestone on the KUH program.</p>
          <p>Now we come to Astrium on slide 15. Revenues for the first half reflect a positive contribution from defense activities and telecommunication services. However, in the second quarter 2009, Astrium booked a one-time catch-up effect for commercial telecommunication satellites for around &#x20AC;200 million that is not compensated this quarter.</p>
          <p>EBIT grew by 7% due to increased productivity and ramp-up in defense activities, as well as higher volume in military telecommunication services that was partially reduced by lower volume in earth observation services.</p>
          <p>Order intake for the first half reached &#x20AC;2.7 billion, order momentum continued from both commercial and institutional customers, but pressure on institutional and defense budgets will have to be monitored. Two new commercial satellite orders were booked in the quarter from Eutelsat Communications and SES WORLD SKIES. Both orders are based on Astrium's Eurostar 3000 platform.</p>
          <p>In addition, two earth observation satellites were booked for Kazakhstan. However, order intake was significantly lower than a year ago, which included the huge orders for Ariane 5 batch PB of 35 launchers, as well as the M51 Trans 3 production contract, which both accounted for nearly 5 billion of order intake last year. Strong program execution in the second quarter resulted in Ariane 5 making its 37th consecutive successful launch, and six satellites were delivered into orbit in around a month.</p>
          <p>And now we come to DS on slide 16. The situation concerning budget restraints in our domestic market is still unclear, but our backlog and growth in export should counterbalance pressure on European budgets. Revenues are stable, compared to the first half of '09, reflecting higher volume from core and export in Eurofighter and missile programs, but a lower volume of service activities. The EBIT result reflects significant growth in sales-funded R&amp;D. The investment is focused mainly on UAV and the secure communications segment.</p>
          <p>EBIT pre-R&amp;D is stable. On Ariane, we are currently looking for solutions with the customer. Nonetheless, we are stressing the need for an early commitment to the program by governments. The order book of &#x20AC;18.5 billion provides a solid platform for future deliveries. Order intake for the first half reached &#x20AC;1.9 billion and includes an order book for Eurofighter integrated logistic support in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>DS continued to expand its global network in the second quarter, forming several strategic alliances, including a partnership with RUAG of Switzerland to cooperate in international programs, such as the Eurofighter, including MRO design, development, and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>DS and Atlas Elektronik have joined forces to create Sofrelog Atlas Maritime Security to become a leading global provider of maritime safety and security solutions. The EuroHawk unmanned aerial vehicle built with Northrop successfully completed its first flight in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now onto the other businesses on page 17. Where revenues increased by 15%, compared to the first half 2010, driven by a higher number of deliveries and asset management activity at ATR and a ramp-up in LUH deliveries at the EADS North America.</p>
          <p>EBIT was in line with H1 2009. The positive contribution from Sogerma as well is higher deliveries in ATR were offset by a negative FX impact at ATR. The market is improving with 31 firm orders and 30 options booked in Farnborough. But the financing environment remains difficult.</p>
          <p>ATR delivered 27 aircraft, compared to 21 in the first half of '09. The 2010 delivery outlook remains stable with a lower production rate as expected.</p>
          <p>EADS North America submitted its bid as prime contractor for U.S. Air Force Tanker Modernization Program. The DOD has clearly stated that EADS North America is a qualified provider and capable of executing all prime contractor responsibilities, including classified work. The successful ramp-up on the LUH program continues. The good on-time delivery performance has not changed.</p>
          <p>EADS North America will build three Armed Area Scout 72X technology demonstration aircraft with its industrial team of American Eurocopter and Lockheed Martin. The AAS will provide area reconnaissance and security during combat operations. It is derived from the Lakota light utility helicopter, which is widely considered one of the most successful acquisition programs in the U.S. Army today. The RFP date is currently anticipated to be in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now Louis will lead you through our guidance on page 19.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our guidance is based on an assumption of 1.35 U.S. dollar for &#x20AC;1 for the H2 average and December closing spot rates.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our guidance for orders, revenues, and delaying profitability and free cash flow. Given the recent commercial success of Farnborough and the number of ongoing companies, Airbus has increased its full-year target for gross orders to above 400. Single Aisle rates, as I said, we will go up to 36 per month at the end of this year up to 38 months in Q3 2011 and up to 40 around in Q1 2012.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the civil helicopter market and its related order stream, I expect to be sluggish in H2 2010. At this stage no significant impact is expected in 2010 from the pressure on institutional and defense budgets. Airbus deliveries should be around 500 aircraft for the full year 2010. Eurocopter deliveries will be slightly below last year.</p>
          <p>Using these exchange rates and delivery assumptions, EADS revenues should increase to more than &#x20AC;44 billion, thanks to a higher number of expected deliveries and an upside to underlying profitability. EADS EBIT before one-off should reach around &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>At Airbus, H2 EBIT before one-off will be lower than H1, compared to H1, the positive impact of higher volumes and better pricing will be more than offset by higher R&amp;D and the deterioration of hedge rates, compared to the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the EBIT performance of EADS will be dependent on the group ability to execute on the A400M, A380, and A350 programs, in line with the commitments made to its customers.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;1 for $1.35, EADS maintains its EBIT guidance of around &#x20AC;1 billion despite the negative exception impact from foreign exchange accrued in H1.</p>
          <p>EADS is also improving. Its free cash flow guidance provided the sustainable year in cash inflow of institutional and government business and subject to pre-delivery payment advances for the A400M program, so free cash flow before our customer financing should be breakeven. Free cash flow after customer financing should be negative due to customer financing. Cash outflows offer around &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>Now, we will take your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We now start our Q&amp;A time. Please introduce yourself and your company when asking a question. Please do limit yourself to two questions at a time. And as usual, please remember to speak clearly and slowly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Mr. Vansella from Deutsche Bank UK. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Two questions. One just around the 40-month target for the narrow-body. Do you need much CapEx to get there and do you think and you are confident that 40 can be sustained even if you go ahead with re-engining of the A320? And the second question was just around the cash flow guidance. Despite the increase in underlying EBIT guidance, the higher level of order intake that you expect at Airbus this year, I was just wondering why there is no increase in the underlying free cash flow pre-customer financing, which still seems to be sustained at breakeven. Is that just conservativism or is that growing caution around some of the defense cash flows particularly on A400M?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps the first question and I shall leave Hans Peter to respond to the second question. The level of CapEx is not very high, is fairly limited. It's a figure you, a low number of 10s of millions. The most demanding question linked to the ramp-up of production is the supply chain. If for that, we are not expecting to reach 40 airplanes per month before the first quarter of 2012. We have to &#x2013; we have discussed with our suppliers and we need to offer the supply chain following us.</p>
          <p>This increase of production is backed by very good order booking for the year concerned. Hans Peter?</p>

          <p>On the narrow body, if I may, add, Louis, we have had as we always told you over-booking and with the contracts we have signed now recently. We obviously even would have increased that and based on this, we feel very comfortable with the rate increase having now reached the situation where at 36, we would have been nearly booked for 2014 already. So, and so far given that the market is much more stable now, we think this is now the right time to go for that. On cash flow in the second half, the major difference to the first half is certainly that we have to ramp up CapEx significantly in the second half. So, we will spend more money in the second half than we've seen in the first half</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So my question, Hans Peter, on cash flow not so much about the H2 versus H1. It was just you have increased your underlying EBIT view for the business by 200 million. We have a level of order intake for this 150, maybe 200 aircraft more at Airbus this year than you previously thought. The underlying cash flow target is the same. Is it just conservativism or is there something negative on the 400M or the defense area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not related to 400M or defense. It's really related to some changes we made now in our forecast. We are talking about the forecast then and the forecast, as I said, had a different saving of CapEx for the two halves so that is one explanation and a lot of other small ups and downs.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Avi Hoddes, UBS, U.K. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys, it's Avi here. Couple of questions, first one on Eurocopter actually. If I undo the one-offs that you took there, Eurocopter would have made a 6.4% margin in the first half and normally the margins might be weighted, I think, because of military. Would we say the cost savings there are coming through better than expected? And how should I think about the profitability for the full year given what looks like a very good performance in the first half. Clearly, it's one off? And my second question relates to the higher sale funded R&amp;D that you incurred at D&amp;S. Is that something, I guess, two-part question &#x2013; is that something that we think should stay there sort of full year, and more generally you are talking about defense budget pressures. Is there a risk that R&amp;D which in the past was more customer-funded and it's become more self-funded going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Eurocopter question, margin indeed is pretty good for the time being, 6.4%. It was impacted through a positive impact coming from an export contract we mentioned. And secondly, it is also positively impacted by phasing of SG&amp;A. So, we would see the second half higher number than we have seen in the first half. And last, but not least, there are some favorable mix impacts in the first half with a good level of service revenues with good margins. So, I think that explains the good margin. You should not extrapolate that for the full year. So, Eurocopter definitely will be below last year's margin as we have said so far. Can you repeat your second question Avi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So yes, the self-funded R&amp;D that you incurred in defense in the first half and that being which you were taking about having negative impact on the margins. So, I guess, the question is, does that persist through the full year? But just more generally and I guess more important, given defense budget pressures that you're talking about, is EADS going to be self-funding more R&amp;D going forwards that traditionally has been more customer-funded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the first part of the question, and the second part, I think, is for Louis. We expect for the full year, probably a slight increase, but not at the level we have seen it for the first half because indeed we had some investments in the UAV segment and also, in security, so it will not persist. In other words, we will see probably some small increase, compared to last year for the full year, but no big change. And on the question on self-funding, Louis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the self-funding, we are self-funding for time being some studies on the Talerian UAV and &#x2013; but it will be limited. And we will not continue such self-funding if we have no commitment from customers. And it's clear that we are not underway to increase globally self-funding on defense projects. We consider that development has to be financed in the conventional way by customers.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Sandy Morris from RBS, U.K. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Just one &#x2013; this is really on the sort of profile that the A380 will take. A part of it me thought that rising deliveries, given that you do unit cost not program accounting, might actually be quite a drag on profits. But we're at the same level. Would you like to sort of give us a clue as to how it might evolve through the second half and then into next year if deliveries continue to go up? Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Sandy. Yes, I mean, we are increasing deliveries on 380. We have seen now seven in the first half and we should see another 13, around 13, in the second. We obviously see, I mean, the impact of A380 in our profitability, which is at a level we have seen last year, and roughly, we will probably see next year as well. Now, what we have, Sandy, is on the loss-making contracts, there are provisions, which are consumed, so they are not weighing on your, say EBIT. On the other hand, we have all kinds of inefficiencies of customer support activities, of continuing support activities, which are directly expensed, which are at the level we have today, and which will not change so quickly.</p>
          <p>And then obviously we, over time then, will see impacts coming from the learning curve, so we need to progress on the cost side going forward, into the years 2012 to '14 to reach, I would say, a situation we have communicated recently, which is approaching the breakeven in '14,'15.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, and again, on the A380, first could you talk about what you are looking at in terms of a trajectory for rate? You said you're going to do 20 this year, but what rate do you expect to be at the end of the year per month, and can you give us sense of what you are targeting going forward? And then following on the discussion about margin, are you finding that the support costs which do get sustained over a longer period of time, are those at a higher level than you would have thought previously? Or is the main issue really getting down on the learning curve on this airplane to get to a point of profitability eventually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the trajectory for next year, we are not giving any information for the time being. We will be more outspoken before the end of the year. But certainly, we are ramping up. Under margin, I leave Hans Peter to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the support costs, I mean, if we compare it probably to some time ago, yes, we spend probably more money. We are heavily working on the maturity program of the A380 to improve the dispatcher liability, which is still an issue, but which recently has nicely improved. We just have to keep this at a sustainable level. So, indeed this is, your suspicion is right, we spent probably more money than we would like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you say that if you come down the learning curve and if you improve dispatcher liability, those are the things that you need to get to breakeven? In other words, you're not at a point on support costs otherwise that would really prevent you from reaching the breakeven target you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, we will need that over the longer-term. In the shorter term, I don't think it will change so much, simply because we still add new customers, new roots to the root structure of the aircraft which needs support obviously, and whenever this is at a recurring level, as we say, obviously then you might &#x2013; we might see also some stabilization and decreases there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I've got two questions, please. The first one is regarding the latest WTO ruling. So, what consequences do you see for EADS? And please do not argue with comments about your rival, or so just name what could be the final outcome for EADS? And the second question is regarding the A350. Perhaps you can just remind us about if you're feeling well with your on-time schedules? Or could we see the first flight in time or is it more right what the press currently speculates? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First in the WTO rulings, you have seen that you have been commissioned as appeal on the decision of the panel. It means that the process is not achieved. In any case, the panel has not made any recommendation on the way to implement its own recommendation, and we don't see concrete consequences of the decision of the panel adding to that that we are appealing. And you know the most probable outcome will be after the release of the report on the panel against Boeing that we will have to see if a negotiation can be managed and we are seeing every time that this negotiation we'll have, at certain period of time, we'll have to associate all the partners, from newcomers in the market and big suppliers, because you know that our industry is becoming more and more global and not only before &#x2013; between the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>On the A350, you know that we have to deliver the first airplane in summer 2013. For the time being, we are sticking to this time schedule. We know that the program is very changing and we have eaten a large part of the buffer &#x2013; we had on time schedule and the work of the &#x2013; task of the program management team is to recover part of this buffer. But you know that it's a very changing program, not only technically, but also for the certification process.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. I've just got two questions, please. Firstly, just around over-bookings. Hans Peter, you talked about the Single Aisle family still being over-booked, hence, your decision to take up the rates. Just on the wide-body side could you give us an indication of how next year and a couple years beyond look and whether at any point in time you'd consider trying to take up the rates there? Something you previously said you're not considering.</p>
          <p>And then just around the kind of cash, the comments that &#x2013; you've obviously got a very strong cash position and you are going to look for strategic opportunity. I mean, could you just give us a bit more color as to what exactly you mean by this and what kind of timeframes are we looking at here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take the first one, Louis, you have the second? On the wide-body question, and how comfortable we are with probably increasing production rate. We are where we are today around eight. We have not changed that, and it is like on the short range. We need obviously materialization of campaigns, which are running. So, at the current rate, we are comfortably booked, or I could say covered, for the next two years. And provided we would see customers, which come on top. We will have to think about it, but this is a question really of being successful in the campaign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that it's a question of policy. We are not over-booking on the long range airplanes. On acquisitions, our answer is the same. It means that we have the capacity to buy &#x2013; to make some acquisitions. We have the support of the board for that. We have to find the opportunities. We are looking for opportunities in a three &#x2013; mainly in three fields: defense, security, and services. And we are targeting in priority, but not exclusively to the United States.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Louis, Hans Peter, and Nathalie. This is Joe from New York and Harry Breach and Carter Copeland from London. We have one question on Airbus and one on military. Mine is on the military. Louis, we read in Le Cirque said the French government is not paying their bills to the tune of something like &#x20AC;2 billion, the entire French industry? And in Germany, we read that they're potentially retiring Tornado early or canceling Me-Ags? And, I wondered if you could just give us a sense of what you see going on in France and Germany? And Harry, the Airbus question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Hans Peter, Louis, can I ask on Airbus, the newly added delivery positions on the A320 line at the end of 2011 and '12, have we seen improved pricing on those, or were they merely covering over-booked positions that were priced some time ago, so no uptick in pricing?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I come to the second one first and then Louis probably takes the military questions. On the 320 line, indeed we added 2012 and '11 some customers due to the success we had. In terms of pricing, first of all, we didn't now replace anybody for the time-being. The pricing is in line with our plan or even above the plan. So, and so far pricing levels have not, in reference, have not changed for us, but continue to be supporting, I would say, our business going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On defense, Joe, I think it's not easy to give you a clear answer. The level of savings in Germany will be around the &#x20AC;9 billion in four years, and in France, around 3 to &#x20AC;3.5 billion in three years. That only we have to expect some impact. We are discussing with the different governments, and our priorities are first to preserve our R&amp;D capacities. It means that we want to have programs for our design offices to keep them live and active. That is most important because it's a way to prepare the future. I think that it's well-understood.</p>
          <p>And second, we are discussing with the government to convince them that programs incorporation are a good way for them to save money. And we have &#x2013; we know that there are discussion between France and Germany, France and U.K, U.K and Germany, for example, to put in common some equipment and to buy them in common. And I think it's a way, which is supporting our business model, which is based mainly on the program's incorporation.</p>
          <p>It doesn't mean that the future is only rosy. I think we have read office three to four changing years in defense. After that, I am sure that, the programs will recover because there is a need and I don't think that the governments will leave in the mid-term programs at the level of 2012, 2014. After that, we will see a recovery.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions, please. First of all, can you just, the definition of one-off, your slide number seven &#x2013; just two things &#x2013; can we just clarify for me what the effects revaluation on the A400M specifically relates to? And also, just conceptually, I was a bit surprised to see NH90 treated as a one-off. Because I don't think you've done that before with those kind of charges. So, if you can just clarify that? And if Nathalie will let me, I'll take that as one question, please. And then, could you also just clarify what the official budget is for the A350 total development cost, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On NH90 and the treatment within the one-offs, I think this is in line with what we've done on other programs like the A400M last year. So, if these are non-recurring charge, which is reported under non-recurrings or one-offs, I think that's fully in line with last year and already with 2008 where we had a similar charge on the NH90 program.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the other item you mentioned, the A400M revaluation, this is related to dollar purchases we have on the cost side, which are obviously becoming in euro more expensive with a stronger dollar. And then there was a last question which -</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, two things, if I can. On the A350, the eating up of the buffers, I wondered in the timescale if you could just tell us what are actually the things that are sort of not on track? Is it supplies or is it some problems that you are having? And can you just talk a little bit about what that means, the buffers being eaten up? And then the other thing, the narrow-body replacements, just wondering whether the customers' behavior is being impacted much yet by the C Series or by the Chinese offerings and what it means to the sort of timescale for your response with a modified narrow-body or replacement narrow-body?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the A350, there is no one main reason for the eating up of the buffer. I think it's a normal processing development. At the end of the day, we are delivering in &#x2013; if we are delivering at the right date, it means we have eaten the buffer completely. We could say that the buffer has been eaten a bit earlier than expected, but it's due to the new technologies, the fact that suppliers have to adapt themselves to this new technology. We knew that it was a changing program. We consider that it's working well for the time being, but with more tense time schedule for the time being, as I've said, we are taking to our field delivery during somewhere 2013.</p>
          <p>On the narrow-bodies, you have seen that the C-series have not been successful in Farnborough, no announcements. We consider that competition is coming and we have to be aware of that, but for the time being we think that we have arguments to respond to this competition. And the discussions, the internal discussions, the launch of the A320 new it means re-engining of A320 is not focused mainly on the market, but is mainly focused on the availability of engineering resources. And we will take a decision the day when we are sure that we have the appropriate level of engineering resources available for the decision to re-engining. You know that it's-based mainly on the fact that we don't see new engine technology appearing before the next decade justifying the launch of a new airplane. And that we think that we have to, to upgrade the A320 in a way, which is allowing it to stay competitive up to the next decade. It's for that we are looking at re-engining of the A320, but I insist on the fact that we'll take the decision when we are convinced that we have the engineering resources to do that without impacting our other products.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antoine Boivin from Cheuvreux France. May we have your question, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Louis, Hans Peter, and Nathalie. First question on F3, on A400M, sorry &#x2013; you are mentioning more challengers on this program and specifically on the FMS. I am a bit surprised because the words used by Telus while doing the FMS a few days ago, we are not so cautious that they were saying that there are challengers, but not more challengers. Could be a bit more specific on this program and tell us exactly what's going on? And also, if things are slipping a bit, then what is your final risk on this program if the deliveries do not occur in '13, as expected? That's my first question. My second one is linked to MBDA, I think recently the CEO, Antoine Bouvier, was quite cautious on the picture of the missile industry specifically for MBDA. Could you comment a bit on what you can see in the light of different budget pressure in this specific segment? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, for them, I am extremely happy to read the statements by Telus. It means that they are confident they could deliver the flight management system in due time. We are now in intense discussion with them on the best way to achieve this target, and the changes are higher than expected, but we have to make a complete assessment of the situation and, with Telus to see how we mitigate the present difficulties faced in the development of this flight management system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you ask amendments to smooth the requirement in order to make it sure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not entering into details on that. It's this mainly a discussion with Telus for the time being. On MBDA, you know, MBDA has two challenges facing it. The first one is certainly is the different budget in Europe, but is not alone, this is the case for the whole different industry and when I was talking about the necessity to preserve the research and development capacities I was thinking also to MBDA.</p>
          <p>The second challenge is that they are associated to some platforms and it's clear, but the sale of certain number of missiles are linked to the sale of platforms and mainly to fighter planes that is global question on the capacity of Europe to export fighter planes because certainly MBDA is associated to the governments of the aircraft manufacturers.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I have two questions as well, please. The first one is just on the defense security division, just wondered if you could remind us please on the split of sales going to Europe against those going to the rest of the world. And secondly, just on the Astrium side, wondered if the deliveries schedule for 2011 are fully funded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have something more conclusion in mind with the delivery schedules?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I just wondering if the Astrium deliveries in that division are fully funded for 2011, because I think Louis mentioned earlier on that there was some concern about some of the budgets in that area as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we mentioned in our cash flow comment that there are difficulties with institutional customers, but we would not expect that at this point the programs would not be funded. We think the funding is there and we will have to be vigilant what's happening within the budget discussion. So, there is nothing particular on Astrium for the time being for next year. On your second question, split between our home countries and the rest of the world, it's roughly one-third, two-third, two-third for the home countries, one-third on export.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. Thank you very much. Thank you for giving me the last question. Actually I have a double question on one sentence in your press release. While you say that some payment delays in the defense and institutional business were compensated by government receipts for development programs, can you say first on the payment delays, what was the exact impact of the current issues in the French administration? So, how much payments did you miss? Did you securitize that, and did you book a profit into the financial result for penalties payments by the French administration?</p>
          <p>And the second part of the question is on the government receipts. Can you tell on which program you have receipts or have you received those receipts by government in H1? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not so specific as you probably would like to see that. Yes, there are some delays. They are not talking penalties, obviously. We have not &#x2013; we have talked about interest rate, yes, but we have not taken profit for anything in H1.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
