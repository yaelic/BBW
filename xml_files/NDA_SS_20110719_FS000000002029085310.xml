        <plist>
          <p>I am very happy to say, welcome to this Second Quarter Report and Half Year Report of Nordea. I would like to start by just tell you the brief outline of the presentation.</p>
          <p>As always, this would be broadcasted to the other Nordic capitals and also on the web. So when you have questions afterwards please state your name and the company you represent so that everyone can follow the questions. We also have a hash tag for Twitter, so anyone who wants to tweet on the presentation can do that with a hash tag, hash NDA for Nordea, Q2, that is hash NDA Q2. And for those of you who don't tweet, hash tag in Swedish is nothing what this is all about.</p>
          <p>Christian Clausen will present the results. Afterwards, journalists are invited to move over the corner I believe to ask follow up questions. Analysts and investors are invited to go into Nordea's hall where Fredrik Rystedt and Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n will be ready to take on any more detailed questions. We will also allow a few questions after the presentation up here with Christian Clausen.</p>
          <p>So with that, I hand over the stage to you, Christian.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to this half year report presentation. I'm pleased to present again a solid report and we have some headlines and key messages. The main thing to stress is that we keep our solid business momentum as I will demonstrate with good revenue growth in the customer areas. We have a lower trading result compared to the very high number we had in Q1, but we also see loan losses at the lowest level for a very long time.</p>
          <p>And this means, we have a very solid foundation for implementing our new normal plan as we discussed last time. The ambition is to stay in the top league of European banks, and we think that a few European banks will move upwards and approach 15% in the coming years. This means that we will work on our cost efficiency and our capital efficiency and I'll come back to these things towards the end.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the results. You have already seen it. The total income is up 8% in the half year. It's slightly down compared to Q1, which was exceptionally high. We also see profit before loan losses up 9% compared to last year. Loan losses, as I already mentioned, are clearly down, and we see operating profit up 30% compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>And let's look into the numbers a bit more. The income is slightly down in the quarter but it stays at a stable level. We continue to strengthen our customer relationship and customer income is strong, but the trading result is lower. And that is clearly demonstrating on this slide where you can actually see that the customer income is up 5% on the quarter and it's up 10% compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>The volatility in the financial markets has meant the trading has been difficult in Q2, so we have a lower trading result with this non-directional volatility is always difficult. We also have an impact after having increased our long-term funding and also prolonged our short-term funding.</p>
          <p>And this has impacted the net interest income, but again solid trends in the customer areas, deposit volumes and margins are up, lending volumes increased and we have stable lending margins. And again, we have this impact clearly in the net interest income where we see the impact of prolonged funding and the more long-term funding and thereby also the reduced return from the liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>The fee and commission line keeps going up at a very rapid pace and this is the most visible reflection over the increased customer activity. Commission and fees is something we get when customers do transaction, and we see it's going up. Savings commission stay at a very high level and we also see good trend in payments commission.</p>
          <p>The fair value result is fairly stable in the customer areas compared to Q1, but the difficult trading conditions is clearly demonstrated here where we see that that part is lower. The whole quarter was characterized by volatility in the market, as you all know, and also by reduced risk appetite among investors leading to lower activity and somewhat lower margins.</p>
          <p>Expenses largely unchanged, staff cost decreased 3%, other costs slightly up, but generally unchanged. And net loan losses are at the lowest level for a very long period of time, as you can see.12 basis points is clearly below the expected average over a cycle. We also have a payment to the Danish deposit guarantee scheme, because of the failure of another small Danish bank, of &#x20AC;20 million. But in general, we see improvements across the board also in Denmark, where we see improvement in the credit quality and lower loan losses.</p>
          <p>Total lending is up 10% on the year, and we actually see some increase in activity in the corporate sector. We see increase in the demand from the largest corporates, which is new compared to several quarters ago. We have seen that, but in general the corporate activity seems to be quite high. Also household lending is up, but of course household lending is growing at a lower pace than it did one year ago. So, I would say the growth rate has normalized. But all-in-all, lending up 10% over the year, which clearly demonstrates that we are supporting our customers in their activity and in financing their expansions.</p>
          <p>The improved credit quality is, of course, very important. And again, I have this picture where we see the rating distribution. You cannot see the figures, but this is our rating scale, and we see that all the lower ratings exposures have decreased and the higher-rated exposures have increased, so upgrading our customers in this period because they are clearly performing better. It's a fairly significant move and we can see that, if we make this cut off at the rate of 4 minus, which is a very stable &#x2013; very strong customer, we see that that part of the exposure has increased. We also see impaired loan losses down. In particular, the non-performing loans are coming down.</p>
          <p>The capital position is very strong. We moved to 11% Core Tier 1. That's actually a full percentage &#x2013; percent higher than it was one year ago and also up on the quarter. We see risk-weighted assets going down somewhat despite the lending growth, and that is also very promising. As we said last time, we have embarked upon this journey of becoming more efficient in all our processes and all our methods and all the ways we do products to ensure that we can do our customer activity with as little capital as possible. And this optimization, as we call it, have lowered the risk-weighted assets in the quarter by &#x20AC;1.7 billion, and also we have a reduction coming from the improved credit migration, as I just talked about.</p>
          <p>So all in all, the Tier 1 ratio is up to 11% and this is also partly due to this very strong capital generation we are having and which we had for several years and this is continuing. We are generating capital at a pace just below 10% per year after dividends, and this of course allows us to build the capital position and also to grow our franchise. And of course, this is key to keep our high rating and lower funding cost.</p>
          <p>Let me give a few comments on the customer side, which are performing very strongly. The corporate customer income is up 6% in the quarter and 8% over last year, and it's very much the large corporates, our deepened relationship, which I also mentioned last time, has really driven up income. We get much more auxiliary business. We have a stronger relationship with the big corporates, but as I also said a few minutes ago, we also see increased lending demand.</p>
          <p>The household customers are also growing 2.5% since Q1 and 14% since last year. The growth is coming down to a level which is sustainable. It was probably pretty high, especially last year, especially in Sweden. We still see a larger number of Gold customers, 41,000 in the quarter and nearly 200,000 since last year. So this whole move of penetrating our customer base and attracting more Gold and private banking customers are still continuing, and we also, here, see improved deposit margins.</p>
          <p>The whole household customer strategy is also continuing, and I won't go through it again. Last time, I talked about our future distribution strategy, how we set up our branches and advice branches and service branches, so you go to a service branch to get service and advice branch to get advice. This is very much supported by the electronic channel and it's moving ahead in a pretty rapid speed. We have by now 250,000 mobile banking customers who are active doing banking business on the mobile; started only a year ago, approximately. So that's a rapid growth and we still are growing the number of e-banking customers now to 7.4 million customers.</p>
          <p>We're also growing our presence on Facebook, where we get a direct relationship to the customers and it is actually an interesting, very close dialog you get with the customers on Facebook. So all in all, I would say that this whole strategy is still developing, and I think it will develop rapidly going forward. This electronic relationship to our customers, supported by the advice branches and of course then the physical outlets and the service branches if you need to do something.</p>
          <p>This is a method to be more efficient in the way we approach a customer, and I think it's also adding a lot of value to the customer, to be able to approach us in this way, so we are highlighting this.</p>
          <p>We're adapting to the new normal. Last time, I mentioned that we have &#x2013; we were announcing a new organization. We have implemented that the 1 of June and it consists of three business areas which builds on the full value chain. So all three business areas have everything related to the value chain, the customer interface, the market support, the product development, the product production, the back office and the IT development.</p>
          <p>And the reason for this type of organization is, of course, that it makes a very focused to follow up on the cost efficiency and the risk weighted asset efficiency and the capital efficiency. So each unit can allocate the resources within the value chain where they make most use, i.e. they can choose between having more customer, people talking to customers, having more product people developing customers, and they can choose where they want to place their risk weighted assets much more directly. And we see that as a good possibility to get even closer to this next phase of our development which we call new normal.</p>
          <p>I repeat our ambition to stay in the top league of European banks. We believe that a limited number of banks in Europe will gradually approach 15% ROE. I showed this slide last time which is built of our own research, gathering research from the marketplace, and I think to be there is pretty important, and the reason for this is of course that these top league banks will be able to attract fund and capital at a lower price than others, and thereby being able to service their customers at a reasonable price. So this is a very much an answer to the new regulation, which is putting a lot of burdens in terms of capital and funding and liquidity on the banks. And without doing something about it, of course the cost of borrowing money in the banking sector will for sure go up.</p>
          <p>And what we do about it is of course, as already mentioned, to become more efficient on capital and costs, and we have started that journey. We mentioned it last time. On the risk-weighted assets, as you can see from this slide, we have already started and begun the journey and you can see that our risk-weighted assets are not actually growing at the same time as our lending is growing. This is very much due to this optimization. And optimization is a word which covers a number of activities being carried out. It's about sourcing the right collateral. It's about ensuring that the data is available for actually making &#x2013; ensuring less risk in the customer interaction. It's also having more capital efficient products and it's about the behavior ensuring that we're in the dialog with the customer, makes it clear to the customer what is actually the capital of funding cost of the need of the customer or &#x2013; and/or discuss with the customers how can we do this in a more efficient way, thereby being able to service the customers with less capital, which is of course key.</p>
          <p>And the other part is to become more efficient on the costs. I mentioned it last time, and I'd like to repeat it. It's very much about making our processes more efficient, continue the journey. We've had that journey for many years now. But as I alluded to under my presentation on the household side, the whole distribution side is one which is bound to be more efficient going forward. And since we have the bulk of our cost base exactly there in the distribution, in the interaction with our customers, this is key.</p>
          <p>So we have already implemented some of the plans. We are developing more plans and we will contain cost growth throughout the rest of the year. And then we intend to keep the cost roughly unchanged for a period of time afterwards, as we say, a prolonged period of time. The way we do it is very much to be sure that we in all processes minimize the costs. This is also related to the behavior, how we interact with customers and very much through the electronic channels, as I already described.</p>
          <p>We still improve our productivity and efficiency and that has to continue, and we see still strong growth in the business volumes per employee. We see strong income growth per customer by deepening the relationships and we see the net bank transactions going up and very much supportive here. It's also that we see the manual transactions in the branches going down. There is no discussion that this development will continue, and as I said, the mobile channel will support this.</p>
          <p>A follow-up on our long term targets which we issued the 1 of January 2007. We all remember 2007, a light year ago before the financial crisis, we actually said we will double risk-adjusted profit in seven years. We didn't know we would have the worst financial crisis in newer times but we can see that we are actually very close of reaching that target. The only reason we are below the line is we have this very low interest rate level which makes our deposit margins lower than we could have anticipated. So, we feel that the underlying business growth and our volumes and transactions with the customers are clearly following this line.</p>
          <p>The second long-term target issued in 2007 was our total shareholder return, and I'm pleased to say that we are still one of very few banks having a positive total shareholder return in this period of time compared to our peer group in Europe.</p>
          <p>So the key message is that our solid business momentum is maintained. We see strong revenue on the customer areas. In this particular quarter, we had lower trading income and we had lower income from our treasury operations due to increased and prolonged funding.</p>
          <p>This development creates a very strong foundation for our new normal plan and we will still keep the ambition of improving ROE and we have the ambition of being in this top league of European banks, which we believe will approach 15%. And we will continue on our cost efficiency and we are implementing the plans to keep cost contained and we will keep working on our capital efficiency and we expect that we can ensure very moderate <mark type="ph" /> RWA (17:33) increases despite that we continue to service our customers.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks and I think we can have some questions now.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Call center here. I suggest we start from the front and move backwards.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Magnus Andersson with ABG. Just two questions. First of all on the target, is the target on doubling risk-adjusted profits subordinated to the flat cost target or is it still the case that the flat cost could be changed if the income would develop differently than you currently expect in the coming, let's say, two years?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on risk-weighted assets and outlook here for the remainder of the year, is it fair to assume that you should be able to counteract any volume growth with your own internal measures and risk migration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will come back on the target setting for the Group later in the autumn, as we're saying in the report. So we have the old long-term targets. We have this guidance for our activities and cost and capital going forward. And of course, these things will come together in some targets which we will come back during the autumn. We have not finalized &#x2013; completed the plans, and it's also still very uncertain how the capital regulation comes out, by the way also the funding regulation comes out. This is quite uncertain and this makes target setting pretty difficult. That's the reason why I follow-up on the old targets now, but we'll give clear guidance for the future. So we have to come back to the target setting. We believe setting targets in an environment where regulation is still not fixed will be very difficult obviously.</p>
          <p>Your second question was on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, risk-weighted assets for the rest of the year. It's very difficult to say. We have growth. We have some FX effects. We have some credit migration. We have a lot of things which is more or less within control, but we know we can be more efficient on the risk-weighted assets. So we'll keep being more efficient and exactly where that comes out is difficult to forecast. But we say clearly here that we think we can produce moderate risk-weighted asset growth despite that we keep on the customer activity and the lending growth. So we don't give a precise number on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I was just wondering, firstly, if you would be able to elaborate just a little bit on what a prolonged period of time <mark type="ph" /> means (20:08), is it reasonable to assume that it's a number of years? That's the first question. And then the second question is, as you point out, one of the main reasons you're below your target in terms of risk-adjusted profit is the rate environment but can we turn that question around and ask you what kind of rates do you need in fact to get where you want to get in terms of risk-adjusted profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let's take the last one first. We have talked about and we did that in last quarters with a normalization of interest rates, which of course is something which reflects a natural real rate which is related to an inflation expectation we have right now. And we are not there yet, particularly not in Europe, Sweden is approaching but Europe is not. So we're not talking about very high interest rates. We're just talking about normalization where interest rates have a real rate then we think that will be enough.</p>
          <p>And your first question was on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What you mean by a prolonged period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, prolonged period of time, but you know that very well because all central banks use that word. They keep rates unchanged for a prolonged period of time. And we thought it was an appropriate way to do it because what it actually means is that these central banks, as long as it's unchanged until we change it. But I would say, for us it means that we expect this to be more than several quarters, and the reason is that we're going to drive down the cost to income ratio by being more efficient. And I will not say a number to which number, but it is for a long period of time reflecting that is not a matter of a few quarters. So, we will do it until we don't do it anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I &#x2013; just a quick follow-up question on that then, would you be able to elaborate just a little bit on the amount of stock that are retiring in the coming years? Maybe that will help us understand how you will achieve your goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's again a bit premature. We have said that during the autumn, we would come back on target setting and we would also come back on demonstrating some roadmap as to how we get to the higher ROE, so we come back to that. But of course we have to run the bank at a lower cost level &#x2013; lower cost to income ratio and our most important cost element is of course people, so I expect there will be fewer people going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Exane BNP Paribas. First question on you say you're going to come back in the autumn to the new tariffs, could you say &#x2013; are you going to announce it Capital Markets Day or are you going to give it together with the Q3 numbers or in what way should we expect these new targets?</p>
          <p>Second question is, in Denmark, you're growing your NII a little bit and you say that you see fierce competition. Could you just explain what's the situation, because a big portion of the smaller banks are basically closed for business and you have a roughly 50 basis points better CDS than Danske Bank, so you should be able to do an awful lot of good business without any pressure on margins, I would assume. But what's really happening with the competition in Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is pretty tough competition, especially on the deposit side, because a number of Danish banks like all banks need to attract funding. So on that type of deposits which are very rate sensitive as some competition, there is not the same type of competition on transaction accounts which are much more stable and part of the customer relationship. In that part, we are growing because we grow the number of customers and relationships and thereby that is growing.</p>
          <p>Also we see a number of banks who may have had &#x2013; have not been that active during the crisis are coming back now and are also are lending money. So the competitive situation in Denmark is still very fierce. I think in all markets despite competition margins will have to go up. The new regulations suggest that margins need to go up to cover the cost of capital and funding and that will gradually happen. One should guess that weaker banks will have to go first, but right now that is not happening and I suspect the reason is that the new regulation is not carved in stone yet. And it's still maybe a few years away from us in terms of when it actually comes into effect, but we expect margins to move up in the coming periods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you experience some sort of flight to quality in Denmark that benefits you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly get a number of new relationships and we also are very cautious and very convinced that we have surpassed all credit spreads and we do that and we still gain customers. So we are very much on the track of pricing credit spreads to reflect the cost of capital and funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question, how you're going to communicate your targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will be sometime in the autumn, so the targets would of course be more precise than this one, but I think the guidance we've given now is pretty clear. It's about the ambition and it's about the levers to get there, but we will have some kind of event or may be during the Q3 report to be more precise in this.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Grabe, Handelsbanken; two questions. First, regarding the liquidity buffer, if you can give us some flavor on how you reason &#x2013; what your strategy looks like when it comes to the liquidity buffer going forward and also in terms of funding duration, if we should extract the development in Q2 in estimates.</p>
          <p>And the second question is a follow-up on the capital side. If you can give us an update on what kind of capital relief you expect to move the corporate book to IRB advanced and also when that is expected? When are you expecting to get the approval from the FSA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question, I think, will be handled with Fredrik. It's a very detailed question, but it will take some time because FSA normally use quite some time to do it and it's difficult to quantify because it will be a discussion with FSA. The first question... sorry?</p>

          <p>Yeah, the liquidity buffer is a very high quality investment in pretty short-term &#x2013; short-dated paper. There are no sovereign exposure to PIIGS countries with anything, and it's a very strong book. And what we have done in the quarter is, we have prolonged the funding of it in anticipation of higher rates, so we sort of moved out on the curve in the funding. And that has been a very good move as you probably can understand, because rates did go up, so in that sense, have anticipated that.</p>
          <p>And we also made some hedges on the risk of the liquidity portfolio of hedging the price risk because of the increased rates book have been done and was part of our strategy, and you see that reflected in the numbers. Now this is something we change over time, exactly what duration we have on the buffer and exactly what duration we have on the funding side. So this will change over time, but this is a reflection of what happened during the quarter and during Q1, which you probably remember where we had a similar effect, somewhat smaller but a similar effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we have the last question over here.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. I have two questions, just to follow-up on the last question there on funding, et cetera. The cost that we see now this quarter for prolonging, you said, both the short-term and the long-term funding and the short-term funding there, if you could just elaborate &#x2013; has that anything to do with matching the dollar funding to any extent in &#x2013; okay, no. And then in the presentation, I think you mentioned that you see some improvements &#x2013; positive signs in Denmark, in your world, Christian. What's the most important or positive sign in Denmark right now that you see? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we see a broad improvement in the credit quality in the sense that we see less &#x2013; much less new customers coming into problems and we see a portion of the customers which had problems coming out in a better state. We still have loan losses in Denmark and we still have a big tail in Denmark after a pretty severe recession, and this tail customers struggling and some will come out in a good shape and some will not survive. So this is still on, but I would say, when we say the credit quality is improving is that we see that may be more comes out on the good side and we also see much less coming in as new problem customers. And this is broad across all sectors and then we can specify on sectors and may be Fredrik kind of elaborate on that, our thoughts, a bit more precisely how we see this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And a follow-up, if I may, on Denmark. In your opinion, is it likely that the Danish politicians will take some kind of measure going forward or will they just, in your opinion, let the smaller Danish banks fail? What's your opinion on the most likely outcome of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will not speculate in political actions. I would just say that it's important to note that the Danish banking sector consists of a number of small banks. A large part of these banks are performing very well, have a well-balanced balance sheet, can attract funding and are doing well. And a smaller number of the smaller banks have maybe overextended the balance sheet and have a funding issue and maybe even a capital issue. And that is going to be resolved, and I think the market itself will take care of it as we are seeing and whether the politicians will do something or not, I will not speculate. It's not popular in the space to use taxpayer's money to help smaller banks, so that's at least one direction you could think about.</p>

          <p>Okay. Welcome to this analyst presentation with Mr. Fredrik Rystedt, our Group CFO will start with showing you a few slides with some in-depth analysis, and then we open up the floor for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So, Fredrik, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. Just to start with one comment, I am here without Ari this time, and the reason is that Ari is in sick leave. He has had an accident with his hand. He will recover shortly hopefully but he is unable to travel just during this day. So, I will together of course here with Rodney try to answer all your questions that may have on the credit side.</p>
          <p>So let me just start with a few different comments that goes slightly deeper perhaps than what Christian did in his earlier presentation. As you see, we considered the income to be good and strong, and that's after a very strong first quarter result and income that we had reported on previously.</p>
          <p>Customer segments grew by 5%, so the decline that you see in the income side is mainly due to other factors and primarily in the market's unallocated side and in treasury, let me come back to that issue. And of course the trading result was, as we highlighted last time, high in the first quarter. And the NII was lower, clearly lower in Group Treasury, and I'll come back to this issue a little bit more, but it has to do with increased and prolonged funding, but also a change of interest rate position. So we have basically reduced the position to practically nothing in the trading or funding operation in treasury, and we've also neutralized the liquidity buffer, so basically just geared ourselves for a higher interest rate environment. And of course that has also actually happened in the second quarter as you have noted. So we would have picked up this cost anyway but the reason &#x2013; the main reason is a reduction, a significant reduction of risk in the funding and liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>So, just to give you a few comments on the changes or the bridge between Q2 and Q1, as you can see we had a good volume development primarily in the corporate sector. Actually the growth level was equal in the corporate and household parts of our business, but due to mix issues, basically margins being higher in the corporate sector, that's why you see the impact being a little bigger. We also see, as expected, the corporate and household margins contributing in terms of results, so the interest rate hikes that we have seen is actually coming through and this is largely a consequence of our transaction accounts, of course, but also to some extent on the sales count pretty in line with our expectations. So overall, you can see that Nordea Bank in here is producing a good contribution, a good increase, and there you also see that other line, including Group Treasury, a very strong minus and thereby giving a pretty much flat development in net interest income.</p>
          <p>Interest rate sensitivity, you may have interpreted my previous comment rightly so that our interest rate sensitivity should have increased quite a lot in the quarter. This is actually not showing in the net interest income sensitivity that I'm showing you about &#x20AC;500 million. It is &#x2013; the reason is simply that you can say that we have changed within that year. So before we were very short in our funding operation and a little longer in the treasury side and where we now have shifted the entire interest rate position in funding that basically becomes in this math, in this equation, on a one-year horizon, it becomes plus and minus. But the underlying short-term interest rate sensitivity is much, much, of course, bigger for higher interest rates at this point of time.</p>
          <p>So, again, just few comments on the loan losses. We have, as Christian alluded to, improvements in the Danish operation in fact pretty everywhere. Loan losses are low in all the Nordic countries and the only area which actually increases somewhat to &#x20AC;24 million is due to shipping in that particular area relates to few customers that also previously had problems. So there are no actual new areas of concern. It is the only area that has increased, all other areas are performing quite well as you can see from these graphs.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans are down by 4 basis points, and it's worth here pinpointing that now 59% of all the impaired loans are performing. So that ratio has continued to increase and the provisioning ratio is largely the same as it was in Q1 at 50%.</p>
          <p>One stronghold and this is of course important for us to see some results that also relates to the new normal plan. Risk weighted assets in the quarter is actually down, as you can see. Credit quality continues to improve, rating migration on the corporate side. We have growth &#x2013; sorry, we have growth on the corporate side and on the household side, but that has also been, of course, mitigated by that credit quality improvement.</p>
          <p>We have growth in Poland and also in international branches, but we have been extremely focused on risk weighted asset's efficiency. Partly this is a model implementation for part of our portfolio which is a small part of that and the rest is collateral sourcing, registration and just nitty-gritty work going through all parts of our balance sheet. And of course this is just the start of it. We have done that last year approximately &#x20AC;5 billion or so in asset efficiency. This quarter was &#x20AC;1.7 billion, close to that amount in the first quarter, and we will continue this effort in the next couple of years. So Core Tier 1 ratio as a consequence of the credit quality migration, of course, this risk weighted asset's efficiency that we have achieved and not least the net profit has brought the improvement in &#x2013; or strengthening, I should say, of the Core Tier 1 ratio to 11%.</p>
          <p>Again, the net rating migration was touched upon earlier. We have an up-rating now of 11.3%, the trend is clearly continuing in terms of improving the credit quality, down-rating is 5.1%. So we have a continued positive rating migration, as I said, in the corporate portfolio of 2.4% and that is stronger in the first quarter. Of course, we have more ratings done in the second quarter, so one can expect a little higher rates or higher level than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Those are the comments that I was intended to make, a little deeper but of course I'll be very pleased to answer all your questions you may have on all of these subjects. So, thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mats Anderson, Cheuvreux. Just on this risk-weighted assets efficiency, Christian touched upon it before and you touch upon it now, but could you give us a little bit more flavor on what you're doing, how you're doing and then obviously what you expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The risk-weighted assets efficiency or optimization, if you put it that way, there are many parts of it as we have alluded to. I think if I may just maybe start with completely differently thing, I think the most important in terms of risk-weighted assets' efficiency is actually profitability for the risk-weighted assets that we have on our balance sheet. So that work is ongoing as well and is basically going through the profitability of individual customers or customer segments. They are going through the profitability of customer or product mixes for individual customers, so that work we have just started on, of course measuring profitability on a full scale in a much wider sense. So this is not really what we're talking about in this particular piece, this has to do with a few things.</p>
          <p>We had, as I mentioned, implemented a model or IRB model for part &#x2013; a small part of our portfolio that has contributed some. We have sourced collateral in the Baltics to a very, very significant extent, producing a good part of this improvement. We have gone through, for instance, credit commitments that are sort of registered but no longer used, and there are a number of other examples like this. So it's basically, of all of the millions of transactions, millions of customers going through, both in terms of being able to identify where we're not profitable or where could we be more profitable, identifying where could we reduce assets and where could we not, and of course also the model issues. So it's all about these things and we're working on a number of different projects that will go on for, using the expression prolonged period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just checking with you &#x2013; a follow-up question here. What you said in the first, that was a question of margin or price on every given unit of risk-weighted assets, that is what you're alluding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you can say that because if you, for instance, have a large part &#x2013; let's just &#x2013; I'll just take an example. If you take an SRM, a relationship manager in the bank somewhere has a number of customers. And of course if this SRM has an explicit requirement to have a <mark type="ph" /> RORACR (41:09) for his entire group of customers, he wishes to actually increase the <mark type="ph" /> RORCAR (41:16) of all customers. He can do that in a number of different ways. First of all, he can identify what is my <mark type="ph" /> RORCAR (41:22), full cost <mark type="ph" /> RORACR (41:24) including full funding cost, including everything.</p>
          <p>He will identify there is perhaps a mix issue. It's simply a pricing issue, or whatever else that could be. So, of course, trying to work with the customer in our relationship strategy and making sure that we do the utmost for the customer with a good product mix. Of course, increasing ancillary business is a key component, as you saw in Q1, as you've seen also in Q2. So part of that exercise, of course, is either pricing issue, elimination increasing, or just doing more ancillary business with customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up also, what &#x2013; you mentioned that you had &#x2013; doing some things in the Baltics of collateral, could you explain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think this is pretty much not just &#x2013; I mentioned as an explicit example, because we've spent a lot of time on the Baltics in this particular quarter. But of course, sourcing of collateral, making sure that we have both &#x2013; we get the collateral, appropriate collateral, for the lending that we do, or other transactions. And we also register that collateral in a good way. And for instance, just more as a general example, updating of real estate values, for instance, is a housekeeping issue that can be done, or simply discussing with the customers to get the collateral that you should have for individual transactions. It's both those things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maths Liljedahl, Nordea. Two questions, if I may. First, if you can comment on the cost development in the second half, what we should expect? Christian mentioned that you would take some actions to contain costs so that they will be stable going forward. Would that imply that there will be higher costs in the second half here, because I think you guided previously that costs should come down in the second half over the first half this year. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second on Norway and margins, it seems like retail margins is dropping quite heavily. We know the six-week delay effect, but you also mentioned some internal structure technical factors. What it does if <mark type="ph" /> you actually (43:35) specify, because the margin drops by 14 basis point this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The last question, you can say the large impact there is actually related to &#x2013; is actually related to the lag effect. Rodney, I think you can say the majority of it is related to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the vast majority. I mean, if you just take six weeks of the quarter, that's half the quarter and it's 25 bps. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You basically get most of it, the other things are small. You were talking &#x2013; the second question is related to the cost issue and we haven't given, of course we will never give a clear cost guidance for individual quarters, Maths; that goes without saying. But clearly what we are stating, what I mean, or what we mean by contained cost growth is of course that the cost growth in comparison to the previous quarters in last year will significantly go down. So Q4 will be, of course, not far from, or will not contain a massive cost growth, for instance, versus Q4 of last year. So that's how we compare it. This is no change in guidance, in fact we have become more stringent in our guidance on cost in comparison to the communication we made in Q1. It is identical, in fact, it's just that we have now say that flat cost also for a long period of time. So it's the same basically as we have done in Q1.</p>

          <p>Magnus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Magnus at ABG again. I'm just wondering, in the beginning of July, you announced higher lending rates in Denmark of up to 50 basis points on private and corporate clients. I'm just wondering, what kind of volumes are we talking about and what's the average rate increase that we should see, i.e. potential NII impact from that measure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In July, you say we announced rate increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in Denmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was up to 50 basis points and we've not clearly communicated in what areas they should be, but it's up to 50, and it's both corporate and households.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so can I assume it's for the &#x20AC;45 billion, roughly, you have in Denmark in non-mortgage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it's not possible to draw those conclusions, Magnus, I don't think you should do that. Because of course we are constantly striving to improve margins, and it's not because we think &#x2013; it's not just for profitability reasons, it is an obvious factor that, of course, as funding costs are continuing to increase and we'll do that for every bank, and then you have to remember that we are actually funding ourselves better than most, better than pretty much everyone else.</p>
          <p>So, lending margins will need to increase, and of course that's just a reflection. And we are flagging that ambition; exactly how we will be able to implement on what part of the portfolio is of course going to be a market-related issue, so the exact impact of that will be difficult to speculate on, of course. But generally, we believe &#x2013; really believe, that margins should, over time, go up in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This announcement, it's not from July, it's from mid-August where we will...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. So you will not have the full impact in this quarter. And then as I said, we're not communicating what levels and what volumes, but it affect a large part of the volumes in Denmark. The ambition, given also that the market leader in Denmark has made similar announcement, you should &#x2013; it's fair to assume that margins will go up in Denmark overall.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, trying to understand &#x2013; Thomas Johansson from Carnegie. I'm trying to understand the NII from the Group Corporate Center. It sounds like there's <mark type="ph" /> FX (47:20) that you're down during the quarter, but is this a sustainable level going forward, that we see today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thomas, there are three sources of this increase of cost and treasury, three. And the first one is, of course, related to more long-term funding. We've made &#x20AC;22.3 billion of long-term issuance, and of course that's a lot more than the full year redemption, so that's &#x2013; you can say a pre-funding. That's part of the story.</p>
          <p>The second part of the story is lower net yield, put it that way, from the liquidity buffer. And of course part of that equation is that we have reduced, as I said initially, the risk exposure in the liquidity buffer for rates, and of course that's a costly thing to basically do. You will sort of not be able to generate the benefits from a positive yield curve.</p>
          <p>And the third component is, I said, a risk mitigation or risk minimization in the entire funding portfolio of the group, so there is basically no mismatch whatsoever for interest rate exposure. So, your question is extremely valid. Is this a sustainable situation? Well, of course, it is sustainable until we believe that rates will flatten out or will start to decline, then of course we will change that position and the cost will become less. So, again, using an expression that may not be exact, it will be like this until we change the position back to where it has been for a couple of years, you can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also some other stuff; in terms of the cost program, I understand you're not ready to communicate fully yet, will there be any restructuring charges, or will this only be through normal attrition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot, of course, rule out restructuring charges, that's not possible, but I think it's premature to talk about that. Because as I said, we have worked a lot. We're developing different plans in parts of our business that will ensure that we get to the targets of flat cost, as we have communicated. But we still have lots of sort of finalization of details, not these discussions with unions and other kind of things. So it is not possible to even estimate at this point of time. So we cannot rule that out, Thomas, but it's premature to talk about that. We'll come back to that when we know more, of course.</p>

          <p>Just a final bit then, I've seen two numbers on the costs for the Danish Guarantee Scheme in the quarter, &#x20AC;33 million and &#x20AC;20 million, which is the correct one?</p>

We have the default in the quarter of <mark type="ph" /> Furback Morse (50:23), the cost of that was &#x20AC;33 million. The final calculation of the cost for a <mark type="ph" /> major (50:16) bank gave us another &#x20AC;30 million back from the previous &#x20AC;67 million that we took in the first quarter, and the net of that becomes &#x20AC;20 million, so it's actually those three numbers.</p>

          <p>Peter Grabe, Handelsbanken. Three questions but quick ones, hopefully. First one, as I spoke with Rodney about before, on the matched funding side, or on liquidity side, most other banks reported matched funding period, i.e. if the wholesale funding markets are pretty much shut down, how long can you survive? If you can give a figure on how long you believe you will be able to survive for, or are cash flow neutral?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to the collateral pool, or the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:11) in the collateral pool, especially since other banks report that in their total liquidity buffer, on top of the FSA stated number, and then they add the unused <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:26). And then the third question relates to your impaired loans, since you have such a huge amount of performing loans in your impaired loans, which deviates quite a lot. What would ultimately trigger those to become non-impaired and thereby, I assume, release some reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, the first question, I'm a little unsure of, because there are really number of ways to measure survival period or match cash. We typically look at many different measures. I trust that you're asking the same question as it relates to what SEB calculated, and our corresponding measure is 1,084 days to be exact, and that's approximately three years.</p>
          <p>I think what is maybe more relevant is the asset where you can say the maturity of the liability of &#x2013; the behavior maturity of all our liabilities, which amounts to approximately just over 2.3 years, so that's likely the same. That's all our liability as a whole funding portfolio. Long-term funding maturity is 3.7 and the short-term funding &#x2013; not short-term funding &#x2013; sorry, the asset side is approximately 2.7, so we're pretty much match funded, and we have an extreme, as you can see, long-term survival but also short-term survival. And the short-term survival is actually the measure, of course, the LCR-type measure is actually now what's tracked by the FSA, not the long-term, that's more of a marketing issue. But, again, as I said, that's 1,084 days. I think that was your first question.</p>
          <p>The second thing is collateral pools. I'm aware of the fact that most banks actually report that as part of their liquidity buffer. We just don't think that's the right way of doing it, because that's not in actual fact eligible, put it that way, for using. You could use it, so it's an additional advantage of having that, but we are not including that in our liquidity buffer or survival periods. So therefore, we are more conservative and that's, I think, the most prudent thing to do, and the right thing to do. So you should add those collateral pools on top of our liquidity buffer to get us comparable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give &#x2013; sorry for interrupting, any guidance on the amount of unused cover pool that you theoretically...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it's quite a lot, of course, and the reason is that we have used very little of the cover pools that we have in Norway and Finland. So the amount is very, very significant, as you will imagine. That doesn't mean that you should add those, as I said. It's not prudent just add that to liquidity buffer, because you got to issue that and of course, in a crisis situation we would assume that the cover bond market will work perfectly as it has done in the past, but that's a little bit of a bold statement to actually include that, as I have already said, but the amounts are significant.</p>
          <p>I think your third question was related to impaired loans and why it's so much performing. And there again, I think the way we actually &#x2013; we have been actually discussing many times, should we just report NPLs or non-performing loans, which is a much, much smaller number, but we choose to report also impaired loans. And way we actually do that is, we look at individual customers and we assess their ability to, in the future, actually perform in terms of their loans. So that's why we assess them as impaired. And typically, you will say that the provision level is not necessarily as high for those loans as for the non-performing loans.</p>
          <p>And in addition to it, of course, we have the collective provisioning. So, we think this is a good way of doing it, and of course what you have seen as a technical thing during this year in the first quarter and also in the fourth quarter of last year, is that those non-performing loans, to a large extent, were identified early and then they were transferred into non-performing in line with those expectations, and then we used the collective provisioning to put that into individually assessed provisions. So that's why typically, impaired loans will continue to increase. This quarter, it didn't, but typically you would see that happening, at least being stable. That's the way we do things and we think it's a good way, good and prudent way.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question on the liquidity buffer, actually we have a strict definition on our liquidity buffer compared to the FSA and the Swedish Bankers Association. If you look in our Fact Book, you will see that, according to the Swedish FSA definition, the buffer is actually 61.8 instead of the 57.9. But you see that in the Fact Book &#x2013; and then also on our unutilized part of the covered pool, you'll see that &#x2013; you will have updated numbers on our ir.com site. And then I hope the survival period is eternal, but no one knows. Francis?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we look at the last two, three quarters, it seems that your large corporate deposits are coming down, whereas your lending is, at this quarter, slightly increasing and that seems to be an opposite development as SEB. Are you strategically looking at corporate deposit as something different now that, with eventual regulation with net stable funding ratio, are you pricing yourself differently in the market now, with that kind of view in mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It appears that way, doesn't it? I think the short answer is that this is a constant management issue, if you like, because in &#x2013; you can say, one of the benefits of course of cheap funding or low funding cost in both the short and the long end is of course that provides a good basis for a sound P&amp;L. But on the other hand, of course it also creates the disadvantage that sometimes attracting deposits from corporate becomes very costly versus the alternative costs. So, in all fairness just maintaining market share for us in terms of some of the corporate deposit side is actually a costly exercise versus the alternative.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that the amount of deposit, if you put it that way, is actually finite. We can compete among banks to a large extent to improve our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:09) for other reasons, but it will not generate more deposits. So our sense is not to actually take market share is to maintain that and of course do whatever we have do to maintain that. We think that's the right way of doing and no one is really benefiting from the price war in this aspect. So, we are actually trying to maintain our market share but of course &#x2013; versus the alternative, which is not cheaper funding. It is a costly exercise. So you shouldn't expect a loss in market share on corporate deposits in more general terms, but you will always see, of course, one or two competitors being very aggressive. And typically if you have extremely high funding cost, then deposits become a very attractive alternative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May be just a follow-up question on especially with regards to &#x2013; you've seen increased lending from large corporate, why &#x2013; can you give us a color, why would they need to borrow from you and at what rates, given that most large corporates in Sweden can borrow term funding probably cheaper than you or very close levels than you do? How does that make sense for you to increase lending for them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a good question. I think, we &#x2013; you have observed of course that we haven't done that in the previous quarters. This was actually a change in that sense. Well, that's a trend or not, I think it's &#x2013; it is hard to say. I think you may perhaps overestimate the funding ability of large corporates. That's not a general statement that they can fund themselves cheaper than we can. I don't think that's actually true for a wider sense of the large corporates. But, of course, it's typically so that the have attractive alternatives, particularly so in the capital market. Of course that's where they basically can fund themselves on the bond market.</p>
          <p>The large corporates have also been fairly cash-rich in generating good profits in the past and not in fact investing that much. So it's been working capital movement and that was primarily in the, you can say, first part of 2010, and since then a fairly slow development. This quarter, we have seen the opposite. We've actually seen a growth in that segment. That's positive. It's good news for us. Whether it's a trend, I would not actually wish to speculate on that. I think it's premature to say. If goes on for one or two quarters, then we can talk about that, but not now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hampus &#x2013; and if I just may add that, if you look at the deposit side now, we actually have a negative currency effect for the first time in many quarters, so it was 2% strengthening of the euro versus krona, we had some currency and if you look in local currencies, total deposits were up 4%. Please, Hampus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I was just wondering, as you pointed out and have pointed out on several previous occasions, the structural interest income risk table isn't always that useful when it comes to figuring out your actual rate sensitivity. After all, these measures that you've now described to us, what would you say is your actual rate sensitivity going forward? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then the second question, it's a bit detailed, but just out of curiosity. When I look at economic capital allocated to the different business areas, we can say, for example, that economic capital as a percent of RWAs in the Nordic banking operations is 9.2%, in the Baltics it's 7.4% and in Poland it's 4.9%, so it seems like you're allocating very different amounts of capital relative to RWAs in various business areas. I was just wondering what accounts for those differences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the NII sensitivity, I find that very difficult to actually answer for one simple reason, depends on when you look at it. Because if you ask me what's your interest rate sensitivity for the next 10 days, that's one answer. And of course the NII here is on one-year scale. And of course if you are really short in the short end of the market than you're long in the long end, over one-year time, calculating it you will actually be less sensitive. But we have now, as I earlier alluded to, basically neutralized our short-term funding position to &#x2013; for up-turning rate and you will not fully see that in the NII. So again, it's inexact measure in that in terms of time.</p>
          <p>I think it's actually an inexact measure in other ways as well. We are making assumptions as to how much we're able to keep up interest rate expansions on the savings accounts, for instance, and there are other type of assumptions like that. So it's not an exact science, it's actually our way of trying to provide you with the best NII sensitivity on a one-year horizon. And of course, right or wrong, it provides &#x2013; the only reason I was mentioning, it's not a good &#x2013; always a good measure is that you will not see what has actually happened in treasury. But for sure, had we not done that the interest rate hikes that have actually come through in the quarter would have come back in the P&amp;L anyway, so I think that was the answer.</p>
          <p>The EC on the capital, I wasn't actually fully understanding your question, but of course we use different models, so we have standardized more in &#x2013; or different calculations of models in different parts of the group, so that plays in quite a lot. I'm not sure if that's &#x2013; that answer your question, but that's part of the reason and of course business composition is another, so the more you have for instance household typically the less you will have for capital per lending unit, so to speak. So it's just basically a mix and it's a little bit model assumptions and general conditions in the country.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, one regarding your ambitions to see more of a flat cost going forward. How does that impact your ambitions, your growth ambitions within new European markets and may be specifically on Poland? And also coming back to a question, I think, which was asked previously in the bigger press conference regarding the time period you expect for IRB advanced for corporates, are you still expecting it to come around year-end or is it more uncertain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again let me just ask &#x2013; or I'll answer the later question first. We have never communicated year-end, we've said first half of 2012 and that's of course still our best estimate. But in all fairness, we are not capable of answering to the timeline of the Swedish FSA and the other FSAs that are part of that process. So, I would really wish to have a better answer than that, but we don't know. So we're only providing you with our estimate, best guess at this time, which is first half of 2012, that's delicate.</p>
          <p>I think the second question is flat cost. Will it have some implications? Yes, I think it will. It will have some implications and we communicated this earlier. You are now specifically referring to Poland, and I'm not sure actually the new normal planning process. The new normal plan rarely has a major implication for the plans we have for Poland. If I reiterate perhaps what you may already know is that we've expanded quite a lot in Poland over the last several years with many new branches. We've established 45 or so last year, and what we are now striving to do, which is part of that plan is to ensure that we get a full banking business. We're just not too narrow in the Polish business. We're too much mortgage on the household side, too little of savings, asset management and those kind of general products, also transaction and life products to the household sector. So, we are converting, you can say, or transforming the Polish business into a more whole bank similar to what we have in the Nordic countries. And that, of course, slows down the growth rate, but hopefully overtime it will create a more solid business model with good profitability overtime which is possible to build upon.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think in particular Poland would have been very much affected. We would have done exactly this anyway. The speed of that transformation and the resource is necessary. We may take a little longer to implement it than we otherwise would have had, but it's not a major part of the cost saving program, reducing Poland that's not the case.</p>
          <p>I think for other than new European markets, I wouldn't actually say that the new normal plan really has a major implication. I think, of course, so much of our cost base is in the Nordic region, needless to say. So that's where the bulk of the cost program is located.</p>
