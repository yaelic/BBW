      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, our Executive Vice President of Operations.</p>
          <p>Today UP [Union Pacific] is reporting record results. Third quarter earnings grew 38% to $1.38 per share. Solid pricing, higher fuel cost recoveries and strong operating productivity all combined to produce record quarterly operating income of 1.2 billion, up 21%. Although the economic environment has clearly weakened during the year we have maintained our focus on running a profitable railroad and are delivering strong results for both our customers and shareholders.</p>
          <p>UP's franchise diversity provides us with a solid baseload demand as evidenced by the 1% growth in revenue ton-miles during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our business mix was favorably impacted by the strong demand for bulk commodities which brings with it high density, long-haul moves. With coal in particular we set a number of Southern Powder River Basin loading records in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Capital investments in the Joint Line, UP's train size initiatives and coordinated efforts with both producers and receivers all contributed to these achievements.</p>
          <p>Third quarter carloads, despite a 5% year-over-year decrease, were still the strongest of the year. Although most of this weakness is clearly related to the economy, but one point of the decline can be attributed to the Gulf Coast hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Operating revenue of 4.8 billion was a quarterly best up 16% on the strength of both price improvement and fuel cost recovery. As we announced in September, moderating fuel prices were also good news in the quarter. Rob will walk you through the details, but for Union Pacific lower diesel fuel prices help our bottom line since we don't recover 100% of the higher costs.</p>
          <p>Operationally we had a very good quarter. Despite hurricane disruptions we set a quarterly operating best and attained our highest quarterly network velocity in five years. Better network efficiency translates directly into lower operating costs and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Jack to talk to you about our revenue results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Well, our strong price improvement in each of our six businesses drove a 16% increase in freight revenue to a record $4.6 billion, overcoming a 5% decline in volume resulting from continued economic softness and the disruption caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.</p>
          <p>Five of our six businesses set best-ever marks for revenue with only Automotive failing to set a new record and at the same time we had another great year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter we continued to grow in markets tied to the global demand for energy and food but two hurricanes and the weak demand in some of our key rail markets more than offset that growth, leaving our volume down 5% for the quarter overall. Economic softness continues to be most evident in the automotive and construction-related markets along with the international segment of our Intermodal business.</p>
          <p>Production cutbacks by the largest auto manufacturers led to a 25% drop in vehicle shipments and our parts volumes were down almost 22%.</p>
          <p>Industrial Products volumes dropped 3% below last year. Our steel shipments grew 23%, and markets related to energy demand like frac sand, pipe and wind components remained strong, but still it wasn't enough to overcome the softness led by a 24% decline in lumber volumes, and a 9% falloff in rock shipments.</p>
          <p>While all of our business groups saw some impact from the two hurricanes, the impact to the Chemicals business along the Gulf Coast was most significant. In fact, without hurricanes, I think Chemical business likely would have come in flat compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>The two groups that have been the strongest all year grew again this quarter. Coal demand remained strong and a 38% increase in ethanol and DDG set the pace for our Ag [Agricultural] products growth.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we began to see whole grain volumes lose a little of their strength with shipments down about 1%. Most notable decline was in Gulf wheat exports, which were off 20% from last year's record setting level.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect that world production, ocean freight spreads, the shifting value of the dollar, lower feed or our livestock numbers, and global economic problems are going to cause our grain shipments to fall back from 2008's strong market, maybe even slightly below 2007.</p>
          <p>This morning, I'd like to take a closer look at our Chemical, Intermodal and Energy businesses.</p>
          <p>Although Chemical volumes declined 6%, a 20% increase in average revenue per car drove a 12% increase in revenue. The two charts on the left highlight the impact the hurricanes had on the two largest segments of our Chemicals business, plastics and liquid and dry chemicals.</p>
          <p>The falloff in September comes from not only the disruption that occurs as the storms came through, but also the aftermath as we waited for commercial power to be restored and production facilities were brought back online.</p>
          <p>Customer recovery from these storms is still not complete, and we expect to lose probably as much as 2000 cars here in the fourth quarter, mostly in plastics where plants are not yet back in full production.</p>
          <p>Beyond the clear impacts of the hurricanes from September volumes, both liquid and dry and plastics are also starting to see some softening due to their ties to housing consumer markets, and automotive business and higher oil prices are impacting our asphalt and diesel volumes.</p>
          <p>On a brighter note global demand for food continues to drive growth in fertilizer with our volume up 6%.</p>
          <p>Intermodal revenue grew 9% with a 19% improvement in average revenue per unit more than offsetting a 9% decline in volume. As I indicated earlier the decline in Intermodal was driven by weakness in the international segment where a 14% drop in volume was only partially offset by the 2% growth in domestic.</p>
          <p>Significant portions of the international Intermodal markets are tied to housing and automotive and the economic conditions in those two industries along with reduced consumer spending have resulted in a decline throughout the year in imports from Asia.</p>
          <p>Also influencing the comparison for international is the evolving status of our legacy contracts. Last year, favorable pricing in the remaining legacy deals in our international business actually attracted volume. As some of those deals have now been repriced in 2008 portions of that business have shifted off Union Pacific and that's pretty much consistent with our focus on improving pricing and returns. And we saw that reflected in the Intermodal Group's third quarter results.</p>
          <p>On the domestic side, a contract loss going into the year continues to impact our comparisons year-over-year. Offsetting that loss was a 29% increase in our EMP volumes with IMCs and some share gains from the highway. We also saw volumes improve in our domestic legacy contracts.</p>
          <p>With continued strong demand for coal, a 3% increase in Energy volume combined with a 24% increase in average revenue per car to drive up 28% to over $1 billion. Energy is the first of our commodity businesses to top that mark in the quarter. Coal moved at a record setting pace from the Southern Powder River Basin during the quarter. The chart on the upper left highlights the strong trains per day performance throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Network productivity and efficiency translated into the best-ever quarter for trains for carloads and tons with tonnage up 7% from a year ago. Unfortunately difficult mining conditions and poor coal quality led to a 7% decline in the Colorado-Utah [CO/UT] tonnage. Network performance was the lone bright spot for this segment as we set best-ever tons per train.</p>
          <p>We expect Colorado-Utah growth to be back in the plus side for the fourth quarter; a comparison that's going to benefit from last year's relatively low tonnage. And we expect the full-year for this segment to be up slightly from 2007. For the Powder River Basin, we still expect growth again in the fourth quarter, even against last year's record tonnage and we still think that the full outlook for the Basin remains unchanged at 5%.</p>
          <p>Strong service performance continues to translate into customer value, which in turn is leading to higher levels of customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction improved four points from a year ago coming in at 83 which matches last quarter as the highest level since early back in 1995.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the rest of the year, it's clear that we're not going to see any improvement in the economy. Strong demand for energy remains one of the key drivers of our growth opportunities. For our Energy and our Ag products group, that means continued growth in coal and ethanol; although the pace for both may slow some from third quarter levels.</p>
          <p>Ag is going to benefit from the recent expansion of our produce express service for perishables, a new train from California to New York which is providing the same great service customers' experienced on the original Washington to New York train. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect grain volume is going to soften slightly from the very strong levels that we've seen so far through 2008. And with that Ag moves down into our Mixed Demand Drivers grouping.</p>
          <p>With some softening of Chemical segment that are tied to housing, our Chemical business play out really depending on the expected strength in fertilizer and soda ash and how quickly customers can get back to full operations as they recover from the hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Energy related demand for frac sand for pipe and wind components is going to continue strong for our Industrial Products business. But steel has now fallen back to more normal levels as projects and spending have slowed and weakness in the housing related markets continues. Domestic Intermodal should continue to kind of hold its own year-over-year.</p>
          <p>International Intermodal will continue to run below last year and continued economic woes is going to keep our Automotive volumes below year-ago levels as well. Put it all together and we expect overall volume in the fourth quarter to be down probably around the 5% versus last year which would put the full year outlook at about down 3%.</p>
          <p>Now against some pretty strong comps, we expect volume to run softer than down 5 through October and November and then we're going to make up some ground in December where we were hit by storms last year.</p>
          <p>As in previous quarters core price improvement, fuel surcharge are going to drive revenue growth despite the volume shortfall.</p>
          <p>Based on what we're hearing from our customers and what the economic prognosticators tell us and recognizing that there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in the economy, here's what we're currently thinking about 2009. Right now it's pretty hard to see that much is going to change for the better in 2009. Volumes are expected to be flat to down 2%.</p>
          <p>Any improvement in market conditions looks like it's going to be in the second half of the year. And the second half should also look stronger, because comps are going to be lower quite honestly. Grain shipments likely aren't going to match 2008's very strong demand, and forecasts project that vehicle sales and housing starts are going to decline slightly next year from their already low levels.</p>
          <p>In Chemicals and Industrial Products, the outlooks for commodities tied to weak construction markets are going to stay soft while those markets that have been strong are expected to continue. Demand in all energy related markets is going to stay strong but we're going to face some pretty tough comparisons to 2008 in our coal business.</p>
          <p>The cost and environmental advantages are rail are going to combine with our continued service improvement to create additional opportunities for conversion of highway traffic to rail across our business, especially in our domestic Intermodal business. The anticipated weakness in imports will result in international Intermodal being slightly softer, but we still anticipate a peak season, which was a no-show this year. We think that'll reappear at least to some extent in 2009.</p>
          <p>As a result of our renegotiated legacy deals and the built-in escalators we have about 70% of our 2009 price plan will be in the market by the time the year starts on January 1. And with those pricing gains and improved fuel cost recovery we expect to see solid revenue growth again in 2009.</p>
          <p>With that I'm going to turn it over to Dennis, for the operating report.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack, and good morning. The 2008 story line for UP's operating team continues to be improvement and resiliency. As this chart illustrates, we significantly increased network velocity year-to-date despite a number of weather-related disruptions.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter we made steady velocity gains coming out of the June floods only to get knocked back again in September with the two Gulf Coast hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Fortunately our railroad did not sustain any major infrastructure damage from the hurricanes. The primary issue was the loss of commercial power needed to operate signals, crossing gates and switches, but as you can see we again quickly bounced back from the storms and our network is running very well.</p>
          <p>In fact, third quarter velocity increased more than 2 miles an hour over '07 to 23.7 miles per hour. Year-to-date velocity is averaging more than 1 mile per hour faster and a 6% gain. Beyond the velocity gains our network management initiatives centered around the Unified Plan. Flow control and strict inventory management are continuing to drive further productivity and service improvements.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, terminal dwell was the best ever, 24.4 hours and system inventory at a little more than 300,000 cars improved 4% in the quarter. The last time our inventory was at this level was in March '03 when we were averaging about 171,000 7-day carloads versus nearly 185,000 in third quarter '08.</p>
          <p>Another key driver is our continued effort to improve train productivity. By making our transportation plan more volume variable, we continue to achieve train start savings relative to volume. For the third quarter, year-over-year, we reduced train starts by 5%, and yard/local starts by 4% on 3% lower gross ton-miles. These achievements are especially important considering the impact of the hurricanes. Although terminal dwell times in both Houston yards spiked to over 90 hours coming out of Hurricane Ike, they were back to near-normal within the week.</p>
          <p>This demonstrates the resiliency of our network. It's also a tribute to the coordinated planning and preparedness of the UP team in advance of the storm. As a result, we were able to quickly restore rail service to our customers.</p>
          <p>Better inventory dwell and speed translates to better freight car utilization, which measures the number of days between the originated loads. Year-over-year, our utilization improved 6% to a record 9.2 days. Faster asset turns helps both UP and our customers lower their equipment costs and long term capital needs.</p>
          <p>Better performance in our terminals and across our main lines has added -- has the added benefit of driving better crew utilization. As shown in the top right and bottom left, we improved both our recrew rate and our overall labor productivity. A one point reduction in the recrew rate saves us more than 100 train and engine employees.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2008, we have reduced our hiring levels and our workforce as business levels have been somewhat below expectation and asset productivity has improved. The overall train crew workforce will be down about 1000 people year-end '08 versus '07. Both our crew and locomotive resources have provided us with ample surge capacity during this year's weather events.</p>
          <p>We are translating greater efficiency, whether it be freight cars, crews, train size into a more reliable service product. Jack showed you earlier that our customer satisfaction index at lower right is at record levels. These metrics show good progress, but we also have many opportunities ahead of us to further increase productivity and enhance our service.</p>
          <p>We expect to close out the fourth quarter with the same momentum and improvement we've demonstrated today. Specifically, solid safety improvements, a network that is well-resourced and resilient to deliver improving service, our capital programs are on target in delivering the anticipated benefits and achieving further service and productivity improvements by managing our cost structure to be more volume variable in the somewhat uncertain economy.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn it over to Rob, for the financial review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dennis and good morning. We'll start today with a look at our income statement. Third quarter operating revenue totaled $4.8 billion up 16% versus 2007. Operating expense increased $445 million or 14%, primarily driven by a $349 million increase in third quarter fuel expense. Also contributing to the higher expense was a $66 million increase in other expense.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that last year we reported a $47 million causality expense reduction related to our semi-annual actuarial studies. So if you isolate the fuel and other lines, ongoing operating expenses grew about $49 million or 2%.</p>
          <p>Strong revenue growth and ongoing efficiency gains combined to produce third quarter operating income of $1.2 billion, a 21% increase. UP produced very strong quarterly results especially when you factor in the impact of the Gulf Coast hurricane. Lost revenue and higher costs related to the hurricanes took roughly $0.08 per share out of our third quarter earnings. Revenue losses coming out of the hurricanes were somewhat less than what we had anticipated, saving us about $0.02 per share versus our September guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking at third quarter freight revenue we reported 16% growth to $4.6 billion. Although our carload volumes declined 5% year-over-year increased fuel cost recoveries and strong pricing gains more than overcame that deficit. Driven by record high diesel fuel prices, fuel cost recoveries were the biggest contributor to the quarterly growth.</p>
          <p>In addition we are improving returns on each piece of our business as evidenced by approximately 6.5% core pricing gains in the quarter. The mix of business was also a factor, adding about 5 points of growth to the average revenue per car [ARC].</p>
          <p>Increased Agricultural loadings which carry our highest ARC coupled with fewer Intermodal moves which have our lowest ARC were the primary contributor.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 21, compensation and benefit expense grew 3% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. As we discussed at our second quarter earnings call, costs in this line were pressured by the 4% wage increase that became effective for our union employees on July 1. There were also added costs in the quarter related to post-retirement benefits. And as you may recall, last year's third quarter expense included favorable one-time adjustments associated with the structure of labor contract ratifications as well as our long disability plan.</p>
          <p>Offsetting some of these headwinds are ongoing efficiency efforts relating to both field and office personnel. Greater labor productivity is evidenced by a 1% gain in gross ton-miles moved per employee. In addition as you heard from Dennis, fewer train starts and lower recrew rates are helping to further reduce our crew needs, as volume demands stay soft. So altogether comp and benefit expense is usually a couple of points higher sequentially in the fourth quarter; we expect a somewhat smaller increase this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to fuel expense, total costs increased 44% in the quarter to $1.1 billion. The good news is that since peaking in July, prices have moderated, averaging $3.70 per gallon for the quarter. This saved us nearly $0.10 per share from our estimated third quarter fuel price of $4 per gallon. The bad news is we still paid $1.38 per gallon more year-over-year or a 59% increase in our cost per gallon. And although we did see some catch-up on our fuel recovery lag, we basically broke even for the quarter, when you compare the increase in fuel prices over our benchmark rate for the actual recoveries.</p>
          <p>As we look out to the fourth quarter, we are assuming an average diesel fuel price of around $2.95 per gallon or so. If that estimate holds, we would be paying $0.33 per gallon more than we did a year ago or a 13% increase. Because we do not have 100% cost recovery, higher year-over-year fuel prices are a cost hurdle for us. But as a result of the two month lag in most of our programs, we could actually experience an earnings tailwind if diesel fuel prices stay at the current levels.</p>
          <p>Purchased services and materials expense were basically flat in the quarter up only $2 million. Clean-up costs associated with the Gulf Coast hurricanes increased expenses $11 million in the quarter. In addition, increased usage and prices for freight car wheel sets added $7 million of expense. Offsetting these items, were proceeds from rail scrap and reduced locomotive contract maintenance.</p>
          <p>Equipment and other rents expense declined 5% in the quarter to $326 million. Increased asset utilization illustrated by record freight car utilization, as well as fewer shipments of finished vehicles in Intermodal containers, all contributed to the year-over-year decline. In addition, with less volume demand and faster asset turns, we have returned excess leased equipment. As I mentioned earlier, other expense increased $66 million in the quarter, primarily as a result of the $47 million unfavorable comparison. We also had higher costs for property damage, state and local taxes and utility costs.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter operating ratio of 74.9% is the lowest quarterly ratio we have recorded post-merger. Over the last three years we have taken more than 11 points off of our operating ratio. As we have discussed before, UP is driving this improvement through both yield gains and productivity.</p>
          <p>When we talk about yield, it encompasses both our strong pricing gains as well as the continued expansion of our fuel surcharge programs across all of our businesses. As legacy contracts renew, we have the combined opportunity of increasing prices to a market rate as well as adding adequate fuel cost recovery mechanisms.</p>
          <p>On the productivity side, we must first provide a safe transportation product. But beyond that, the efforts of Project Operating Ratio have focused the entire organization on increasing efficiency and eliminating waste. Coming into the third quarter, we knew we had a tough comparison against last year so making this next step of improvement gives us great conviction in our ability to drive greater profitability in the future.</p>
          <p>Moving on the to the full income statement; third quarter other income was $2 million lower year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower gains from real estate sales. Year-to-date, other income totaled $67 million making it likely that full year other income will be roughly 90 to $100 million.</p>
          <p>Quarterly interest expense increased $6 million to $130 million driven by higher average debt levels in 2008. Income tax expense increased $31 million in the quarter or 8%. Although our taxes are higher year-over-year, the effective tax rate is nearly five points lower. Last year our effective tax rate was higher at 41.3% as a result of new tax legislation in the state of Illinois. Our 2008 rate of 36.6% was slightly lower than expected as a result of federal tax audits and state tax law changes, adding $0.03 to our third quarter earnings. For the fourth quarter, we are planning on a quarterly tax rate of roughly 38%.</p>
          <p>Net income was a quarterly best, $703 million up 32%. Earnings per share increased 38% to $1.38 per share. As a result of our ongoing share repurchase program, UP's outstanding share balance declined 4% in the quarter. This repurchase activity is allowing our earnings growth to outpace the rate of net income increases, delivering more value to our shareholders. As we approach the end of year, I'll give you a quick update on our capital spending.</p>
          <p>At this point, we think total capital could be slightly more than $3.1 billion. Added capital costs as a result of the Oregon mudslide and Midwest flooding will likely push us over the original $3.1 billion capital plan assuming that all the other scheduled capital work is completed as planned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the split between cash capital and leasing, lease financing is somewhat lower this year at $353 million, primarily as a result of fewer equipment acquisitions.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million shares of Union Pacific common stock, returning nearly $445 million in cash to shareholders. Since inception in January of last year, we've repurchased almost $2.8 billion worth of stock. Although we completed the initial 40 million share authorization during the third quarter, we have the new 40 million share authorization that was granted by our Board in May. Our repurchase program gives us an opportunity to take advantage of the today's low share price, but of course we'll balance this with all the corporation's cash needs to ensure that we continue to have solid liquidity, especially in light of today's uncertain credit environment.</p>
          <p>In fact, let me spend the next few minutes talking about UP's current debt levels and our liquidity position. Slide 29 illustrates UP's adjusted debt balance as at the end of September, totaling $12.7 billion or 44.7% adjusted debt to capital ratio. This is in line with our targeted mid 40s debt to cap ratio, and is consistent with our continued commitment to maintaining a solid BBB, Caa2 investment grade credit rating.</p>
          <p>Since the end of September, we issued an additional $750 million of ten-year notes, which adds to that debt balance. We then have $500 million in debt maturities rolling off within the next four months. Between the proceeds from the recent issuance and the cash already on our books, our liquidity remains strong. We won't need additional equipment financing this year as our program is already completed. So we continue to be well positioned to meet key cash needs. And finally, our liquidity position is enhanced by our $1.9 billion credit facility. We have not drawn on this facility, and we have no plans to draw on it. But we're glad to have it as an emergency backstop in these volatile times.</p>
          <p>Looking out to our fourth quarter expectations; it will again come down to our business volumes and diesel fuel prices. As has been the case all year, these two drivers are really the swing factors in the quarter. As Jack discussed our fourth quarter volume expectations are for about a 5% decline.</p>
          <p>Quarterly volumes are currently running a little softer and we'd expect to see a continued downward bias in November against strong 2007 loadings. But the month of December has an easier comparison as a result of the last year's winter storms.</p>
          <p>I mentioned earlier that our outlook calls for diesel fuel prices to average $2.95 per gallon for the quarter, which assumes oil at $80 or so per barrel the rest of the year. Refining spreads are at historic highs following some of the Gulf disruptions, so we are not seeing the full benefit of our diesel fuel prices from lower crude oil.</p>
          <p>We continue to see volatility in the crude oil market as investors speculate about the state of the global economy. But if the downward trend we've seen over the last couple of months continues, that could provide an upside opportunity for earnings. Conversely if fuel prices spike as they did last year, it would clearly pressure the low end of our earnings estimate. We also expect to continue the productivity momentum we have demonstrated throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>In a challenging marketplace, we have to be cost competitive and we are working daily to align our operating expenses with the business demand. Given these expectations, fourth quarter earnings should be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share or growth of 34 to 45%.</p>
          <p>With this we are raising our full year 2008 expectations to $4.50 to $4.60 per share or year-over-year growth of 30 to 33%. Union Pacific is demonstrating substantial earnings power in the face of economic softness and high fuel prices and we look forward to closing out a record year for our company.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it back over to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks Rob, before we open it up for your questions, I'd like to share our initial thoughts on 2009. At this point it's clear that business demand will remain will remain soft. Our volume outlook of flat to down 2% assumes a pretty weak first half for 2009 with some strengthening in the second half.</p>
          <p>Legacy contract renewals provide support to our core pricing plans which remain steady at 5 to 6% for 2009. Our productivity opportunities are ongoing. We'll continue to balance our network resources with the business demands, driving increased efficiency and service reliability.</p>
          <p>And as Rob, discussed our liquidity and balance sheet are in good shape.</p>
          <p>At this point despite a tough economic environment, we expect to achieve low double-digit earnings growth in 2009. Of course there are a number of moving parts that will continue to play out over the next several months, but our early read on the year is still positive.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to our employees, customers and shareholders is to operate to a safe, efficient, and profitable railroad regardless of the economic environment.</p>
          <p>So with that let's open it up for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yeah good morning. Jim and Rob, I just jumped over from the UPS had their call going on. So I apologize if I'm going to ask you something you talked about in detail. But on the forecast you've got going forward, there's a lot of resilience to the business despite some weakness in the economy, but what do you think the, I guess the room for surprise is in that forecast? What will be the drivers of surprise in that forecast either to the upside or to the downside?</p>
          <p>I mean do you think pricing can come in maybe better than you're expecting in the five to six and do you like the volume side may be on the downside is pretty conservative with that 0 to 2%, or is there some risk that that might be worse than that range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Tom, the wildcard here really is the consumer and what happens in the economy. We're as we stated here not assuming a real strong year. You can -- and we'll manage accordingly. I think we're going to be very cautious in terms of what we look at in our spending and going to be very aggressive on our operating productivity.</p>
          <p>We have mitigated fuel here with our fuel surcharge program, but we're still not recovering 100%. So you see a continued falloff in fuel, you might have a little bit of upside there. But it's just tough to &#x2013; we're going into the year with it's pretty uncertain, we're going to really watch our costs and be prepared if we see a little uptick to get it to the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your productivity trend has been very impressive and it seems like perhaps even if you were worse than 2% volume, even if you were down 4% or so, you might be able to get into the range you're talking about. Is it fair to think that maybe you'd have some upside from productivity to offset if volumes did come a little worse than you're expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Tom. Again I feel good about our productivity, we've got as Dennis mentioned, we're still even we had a -- with the quarter, we had, we are still recrewing over 7% of our trains, that's a good opportunity. And again the question will become one on, if you have a more serious falloff in volume demand, what does that mean for fuel prices? I mean they generally correlate with each other. So you could have some upside there, we also have I think something  that's a little bit different than what we've seen in prior years which is our attrition.</p>
          <p>Historically when you had a sharp falloff in volume, the only way you took labor costs out in a lot of cases was to do a buyout program. Even with the slowing economy, we're still to &#x2013; we'll still have good attrition which we'll take advantage of if our volume falls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last one and I'll pass it along. You're &#x2013; you've had very strong focus on returns, and I think a lot of discipline on taking rates up and you've got the legacy contracts. Are you seeing anything at all from your primary competitor that would indicate a little increased focus on getting some volume in the weakness, or do you think that the competitive dynamic is still pretty similar to what it's been over the last year or two years, even though with the volume outlook it's gotten a little more challenging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Tom, I have to concentrate on Union Pacific here. We're very focused and understanding of where our returns are, the markets we should be playing in, and offering good service. We are going to keep the pressure on our team in terms of making certain the minimum returns are there when we look at our business. And we could lose some; we've lost some on and off both in terms of business that didn't meet our return expectations. But we're going to focus on running our business, and continue to increase our return on capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi gentlemen, thanks. When I -- sorry about that, I'm getting an echo here. When I look the productivity trends and I understand there was a hurricane in the quarter but outside of fuel, it looks like the unit cost performance on a GTM basis was not nearly as good as we'd seen the past few quarters here. It looks like if you adjust for some of the one-time items it was probably a little over 4% versus flat over the previous year quarters. Is this more of an anomaly or is it -- how do we think about that, is productivity are the productivity gains becoming harder to obtain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you lose volume Adam, you're not going to match it 100% in terms of the unit costs. I assume you're taking fuel out of that equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in here; I would also take a look at what's happened with the unit costs on a revenue ton-mile basis. You actually &#x2013; revenue ton-miles were up 1% and so you get a little bit better look out there. But again in our business if you have a sharp fall off in volume, you're going to have a little pressure in unit costs. I would though keep this in mind though, we still see good productivity opportunities going forward next year and we will manage our costs accordingly as we see volume. It's just tough to get them out quickly when you see a sharp falloff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, fair enough and in terms of the mix impact. It seemed like it was pretty big in the quarter. And I know some of that is just the commodity mix but it seemed like there were some ton-mile whether it was length of haul or tons per car that really were a big benefit too. Can you give us any sense of whether that's just because of the hurricane or can some of that continue going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you look at it overall, you'll see that with our Intermodal businesses being soft, when you see the bulk businesses increasing, when you see with the export business and things like that, you can see that shift kind of manifesting itself in to a very favorable mix in the quarter. I think the fourth quarter; our grain business is going to be a little softer here because of the shifts in some of our wheat and things like that across the country. But coal is going to continue to be strong. Fuel's kind of softening up a little bit, so you may see that mix impact decline a little bit. You won't see it quite as pronounced as what we saw in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then one just last one, and then I'll pass it on here. In terms of CapEx for 2009, it seems like -- I mean, clearly everybody is worried about volume trends, and I think, Jim, you sort of hinted at it. Is there any thought about, hey, maybe we pull back some of the growth CapEx here. I mean we've had permitting issues anyway, but things like double tracking the Sunset Corridor. Does that make sense in this kind of environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to take a hard look at our capital. What we need to make certain we do here is not lose sight of the long-term opportunities, which I absolutely believe are there. But we'll take -- we're going to take a hard look at it. Where we see maybe the slope of the line on growth isn't as strong here in the next several years, we will take a hard look at it. But it's &#x2013; I do have a minimum commitment here in locomotives. I've got  the last year of a three year program, so I've got a one-year commitment on locomotives, 125 locomotives that quite honestly right now I don't need. But part of that's our velocity that we're generating here, but we're going to take a hard look at capital for '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about the visibility into the legacy contracts? I know you'd talked about what's coming up in '09. Is there some visibility or some that you just have pretty &#x2013; you're pretty far apart and you have confidence that are going to go away; that from a profitability standpoint it helps, but that's in your volume? Or from what you see pretty much there's nothing that's obviously not going to be resigned in '09 as it comes up?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Ed most of our legacy deals for '09 are done. And we have probably no more than 2% coming up in the year itself before year-end. And the majority of that is going to be coal business. We have lost some business and the reason we've lost it is because in the old deals that we've done, we did winner-take-alls. And we ended up some business that quite honestly doesn't fit our franchise very well. And so we've lost some of that. But we're fine with the legacy deals that we've renegotiated, there are lots in place. We've got solid pricing, we've got fuel recovery, we've got good escalations and we're feeling quite positive about our legacy deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And if I'm repeating something, again like Tom said I was UPS a little bit, I apologize. But can you talk a little bit about coal expectations? I saw what you talked about with Colorado and Utah. But can you talk about the PRB [Powder River Basin] and you sense of demand for coal going into '09? As well as your sense for the little amount of export coal that you're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the PRB right now. We see demand still continuing to be quite strong. We're encouraged by some inquiries and some test moves going to the East. We're also very excited that we had the Head of our coal team out in Prague at the Coaltrans Conference and the developing world of looking for opportunities for Powder River Basin coal in places like Japan where they don't want to be totally tied to Australia. And some of those other places. Indonesian coal has the same kind of burn characteristics, so those are other markets. So we're pretty pumped about the export side of the business.</p>
          <p>Domestically right now our customer base is about where they want to be in terms of where they are for the year. They're not really oversupplied; we have a couple that probably have too much coal. We also have a couple of very large ones that'll take all the coal we can get them.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the overall, our knowledge of stockpiles and working with customers, we're in pretty good stead there. And we think it's going to play itself into 2009 as well. As I said we did have a couple of losses from this year just in terms of the fact that our franchise isn't probably as good as the other folks are.</p>
          <p>But that will play itself out, we'll be fine. The disappointment for us with Colorado-Utah we went into the year thinking that Colorado-Utah would be a plus 4 or 5%, kind of an idea as the export demand heated up. But they've run into some really tough mining conditions. They're working really hard to solve that. So I think we'll probably be more in the 2% or 2.5% kind of world for that export business out of Colorado-Utah.</p>
          <p>That's also though very strong demand that's that 11,000, 12,000 BTU kind of coal that Japanese steel makers and things like that would be very happy to have as a source. So we're working with the mines and doing everything we can to help support them in terms of delivering that coal to market. So I think the outlook for coals is very strong. We think it's going to continue next year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the zero to negative two total volumes what's the total coal prognosis, I'm guessing it's above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know what? We think coal is going to be relatively flat year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about; I think it was Jim, your general comments where you talked about you expect for '09 that there'll be some strengthening in the second half. What's that based on? Is that just hope more than anything at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter]. Well, Ed, you always have to have some hope, I guess. But at the end of the day here we're not expecting a real strong recovery. This isn't going to be a sharp jump. We just believe you get towards that latter part of the year, we'll probably see a little bit of an uptick. So don't read into that, that that is a strong recovery.</p>
          <p>You also have cycle in comps. I mean I'm not certain how much lower our lumber and construction business can get. It's down almost I think from the peak probably 60%. You look at your autos, the finished vehicles business; we're down 25% this quarter. You're running an annual vehicle sales rate I think is around 11 or 12 million, that's out here. So, again it, don't think of it as a sharp uptick. We're just simply looking at probably some up-tick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Does the buyback slowdown in your mind at some point if the credit market uncertainties continue? Or are you pretty comfortable with the pace you're on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very comfortable with where we're at here. Again our liquidity position's in good shape. We had access to the capital markets, a little bit higher costs than what we wanted in terms of what we're paying. But the business is generating good cash. We've got flexibility in terms of our capital spend next year. But with the stock sitting at $57 a share, we're going to continue to be &#x2013; to buy stock.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The good news is it's opening higher than that. The Rail Safety Act (sic) [Railway Safety Act] now that we know what the beast looks like, have you had a chance to look at between positive train control [PTC], reduced limbo training? Where do you think are the areas that are going to impact you and is there offsets in productivity? How do you think about these costs going forward?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Ed, we don't think there's going to be a major impact to us here on the Rail Safety Bill. That obviously there's some things we're going to have to adjust our operations accordingly. The limbo time issue is one that we'll have to continue to work with the organizations on. Maybe possibly restructure some of our crew districts; we'll take a look at that. That's not going to be a major impact to us. Obviously the PTC thing is going to be a challenge to us. The funding on that is going to be critical.</p>
          <p>We'll take a very measured approach to that in terms of priority. We have our two pilots already in place that will be running to fruition in '09. One of them's up in the coal field across Nebraska and Iowa, the other one's up in the Washington in dark territory, so that's going to help us really get a good gauge on the benefits here.</p>
          <p>We think there's benefits to be derived from the fuel standpoint, additional capacity and certainly safety. And we'll look at the labor situation at some time in the future. And that obviously will be negotiated. So bottom line on rail safety, there's going to -- we are going to have to learn the interpretations for sure. We're all about doing that right as we speak; we don't see a major impact at this point.</p>

          <p>I have a question for you on fuel consumption. You guys have made impressive moves there with volumes down 5%, fuel consumption down nearly 10. I was just wondering if you could tell us about what's going on there and what's driving that?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are taking the multitasking approach. We've talked a lot about fuel and it's been a big deal for us, and it's not just a new phenomenon, it's one we've been working on for several years.</p>
          <p>First off, we'll start off with what we have a employee recognition program called Fuel Masters, which our professional engineers gauge themselves against basically a golden run and are recognized commensurately. We call it a gas-for-gas program, and it's been very successful, and our engineers have really internalized the challenge of fuel consumption, and have really helped us realize some of the savings.</p>
          <p>We have a fuel conservation speed that we put in, it's the optimum speed that we allow our trains to run at, and we take advantage of gravity where we can, but there again operating practices and the engineers have been very significant in that. We put a maximum speed out there of 50 miles an hour.</p>
          <p>Our distributed processing, our technology has been very influential. We think there is about 4 to 6% on a DPU train of fuel consumption savings and we've been raising our &#x2013; the percent of our ton-miles from about 30% up to over 55% now that our handled with DPU, and we're going to continue that trend into '09.</p>
          <p>And then obviously our shutdown policies, that's system wide, all crafts and we've been successful in driving it there. So I would just say a good use of technology, our new locomotives, the age of our fleet and the operating practices of our engineers have been the key drivers in the fuel conservation.</p>

          <p>John if I could just add one other comment to that and that is the mix affect in the third quarter certainly benefited us as well.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. Just can you quantify at all the fuel surcharge, the lag benefit in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we're not recovering the 100% of fuel, higher fuel prices still are a negative on us, but it's, there was a slight, basically if you just look quarter-over-quarter, we recovered &#x2013; the lag affect helped us out where it was about a push. The costs versus the recoveries in the quarter alone were about a push.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You mentioned that 70% of your pricing is locked and then I think Jack threw in that all the contracts were pretty much locked in for '09. So just wanted to dig into &#x2013; I presume then the 30% that's left is the stuff that renews annually like grain. So what would be your expectation for the remaining portion? Do you think you see pressure if we get a little bit of pressure on the volume side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, the market is going to determine how effectively we can be on the price side. We're going to have some of those markets that we will do very well in pricing. We'll have some other places like in the lumber world and places like that where it'll be a little bit tougher. But we're still thinking overall it's going to average out into that 5 to 6% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the grain, the Ag market, looking at the articles we've seen obviously reading the papers the last couple of days about how some farmers are really pulling back on some plantings. Just wanted to get your outlook for the market there from what you're hearing from your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're in a position right now where if you look at our fourth quarter year-over-year the big difference is going to be export wheat. We had a great program last year and the United States wheat crop was excellent and others were soft.</p>
          <p>This year the Baltic, the Eastern European, Australia all had solid wheat programs, harvests were good. So that's going to get softer for us. The other thing that we're seeing right now in our grain markets is because of the high feed prices there's been a reduction in the head count, or &#x2013; the head count &#x2013; in the animal count for things like poultry and cattle, and that is impacting to some extent as well.</p>
          <p>I think it's still pretty early to say what the total market outlook for next year. We're thinking, we could be down a little bit from our record setting pace here in 2008. But we don't expect it to be a heck of a lot. And there's always the upside that crop conditions around the world, what happens with the value of the dollar, those kinds of things could turn that around. And actually turn it into a positive for us.</p>
          <p>So we're just watching very carefully. We're going to have the capability to move it and we think ethanol is going to continue to do well for us. We had a couple more plants come online and we think that will be some upside for us next year. So I think it will be okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then Rob, I take it from the shift of guidance for the near-term there's nothing you're changing on your 2012 targets at this point, is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to confirm, I think you addressed this earlier, a quick question in terms of your legacy contracts. One of your previous slides from a previous quarter, it's 3% of your legacy contracts that are yet to -- that are set to reprice in '09. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, where I am right now, I still have 2% to go in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then trying to understand the $750 million debt issuance from a few weeks ago, was the goal of that to take care of all of your '09 financing needs, it's just struck as a little interesting that you were in the market during such a tumultuous time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it was just part of our liquidity plan. It wasn't to take care of our '09 needs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And at this point though I mean based on the slides that we saw it looks like you &#x2013; and as you highlighted you have substantial liquidity on hand, even excluding the revolver &#x2013; or the credit facility to feed all of your upcoming debt issue &#x2013; your debt maturities for pretty much through '09, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Assuming we meet our plan and one of the things that we do have is about a $250 million term on debt due early like February timeframe. So we're well positioned for that at this point of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in good shape, Dave</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then maybe, just one last question following-up on, I think it was Ed's question on share repurchase. Do you have a &#x2013; is there a stated plan in terms of how much free cash flow or much of the operations you plan to return to shareholders through a combination of the dividend and the share repurchase program? Or is it more based on a quarter-by-quarter assessment of where the stock price is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we're opportunistic and we haven't given the number on that. So we take advantage of opportunities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. How's your pension funding doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I think we do not have a requirement to fund our pension plan. So we're in good shape there. But of course like all other pensions we felt the impact of the market. So we'll take a look at it at year-end and if there's a need to put additional cash into the fund we'll take a look at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any sense whether that would be a significant requirement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no significant requirements. I mean it's down, we're running down about 15% right now. So we'll take a look at, it might, maybe that's 100 million or so. But we'll take a look at what the needs are at the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been putting cash in over the last several years. And it's pretty healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's pretty healthy, fantastic. Regarding domestic Intermodal it has shown amazing resiliency, what's driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of it is our great service. I think our Intermodal customers are looking at the performance of our key Intermodal lanes and in particular some of the lanes like our new partnership with the NS [Norfolk Southern] over the Shreveport Gateway. They're seeing the service improvement, they're seeing trucking service deteriorate because of highway congestion, they're seeing our EMP box fleet as being a real opportunity for us. And we are working very hard to win their confidence and their business and it's going quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fantastic but I would expect that as the economy weakens, domestic Intermodal might be doing down. On the other hand you might be winning business from trucking, do you have a sense for the pitfalls of the one being stronger than other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's good service and winning business from the highway that's going to carry the day for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you would expect of that Intermodal domestic would still be coming ahead in spite of the weakening economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And lastly for the coal you mentioned that you were expecting a flat year, is that a flat growth for '09 on coal or is that for fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's -- I think there's a chance it's going to be flat growth for '09 and we will completely offset any volume loss that we had from those legacy deal conversions that I talked about earlier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. Those were the questions, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Randy Cousins with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in terms of your guidance and for carloadings for the fourth quarter you obviously talked about carloading. And I think to some extent Jack you kind of answered the question. But I wondered if you could give us a sense as if carloadings are going to be down 5%, what's your actual thinking in terms of RTMs? Because it looks like your length, your car length &#x2013; your length of haul has actually increased over the course of the year. So if we're down five in carloads, what are we going to be down in RTMs or could we have flat RTMs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Randy. Quite honestly, I think the relationship you saw in third quarter will not hold where you had a 5% reduction in carloads and 1% increase in revenue ton-miles. I think it'll still be there to some extent so I don't expect our revenue ton-miles to be down at the same level as carloads.</p>
          <p>Again, your Automotive business is not going to recover. Intermodal business will be weak. On the other side, our coal business still should continue to be pretty strong; Ag may be a little bit weaker. So they won't be one for one, but you'll still have &#x2013; revenue ton-miles will not be off to the same effect as carloads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a somewhat related question, the GTMs were down three, but the RTMs were actually up, and I &#x2013; again, what's going on there? Are you getting more backhaul business, what exactly is happening there, that the total work goes down, but the revenue work goes back up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, it's just mix when you look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you guys comment on, you've got a strong Mexican franchise? What's happening with your Mexican business, is it growing, is it shrinking? What's happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead, Jack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mexico in the third quarter was down a little bit in volume, 5 to 7%, and revenues were up around 16, 17%, and it kind of follows the path of the rest of our business. Certainly our Automotive franchise is our largest franchise in Mexico, and of course with the automotive companies suffering, that's the primary reason for the downturn, we still had fairly substantial and solid grain movements to and from Mexico. We think that'll continue, and that's kind of how it's going to play out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last question, there's been a rapid run-up in the U.S. dollar on a relative basis. Do you guys see the change in exchange rate impacting your business in any way, shape or form? In particular I'm thinking of the Chemical business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think long term it will have an impact, obviously our exports in second quarter were up about 4 or 5% and exports this quarter were down I think 5 or 6, 7%, something like that. I don't think the short term fluctuation will show up, but long term, obviously it will have some impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot, that's it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays. Please proceed with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. This is actually Brandon Oglenski. I'll keep this pretty brief but could you give us any idea of how much mix really impacted the fuel consumption? Because on a GTM basis, it looked like you got pretty significant gains in fuel efficiency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Brandon, I don't -- it's not quite clear to me in that. But again what you have to look at, the trend has been pretty consistent for several quarters. This wasn't a one quarter kind of aberration when you look at the improvement that's out here. And a lot the things Dennis mentioned on technology, the incentives are driving, including new locomotives. Again when you look at a new locomotive today compared to what we retired, there's a substantial improvement in fuel consumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But does this have anything to do with may be the mix of lot less Intermodal? Is it somehow that the coal business is more fuel efficient on a GTM basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, absolutely. There's no question about it that comes in. I'm just, it's not clear to me. I think it's not a huge impact on the mix, or the mix impact doesn't have a huge impact on the consumption rate, but it's clearly there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I guess looking at your 4Q guidance; I know you mentioned that the lag impact was essentially flat for 3Q. But with fuel sitting here today at about 67, 68, we're modeling a pretty significant gain, just in the lag impact. Is there any way you guys could give us an idea of what that could be in fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean it's again, if fuel goes down, that lag would certainly benefit us. If it spikes back up like we saw last year, it could hurt us. I gave the guidance of $2.95 for the quarter. If fuel stayed where it is today that might give us a positive of let's say a nickel, that gives you some relative spread on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I'm sorry if you guys have already mentioned this but do you have &#x2013; have you given us an idea of how much business is actually rolling over in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't and I'm not quite certain. Exactly what does that mean, rolling over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much business are you re-contracting in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again as I look at my contract base, we got about 45, 50% of our business tied up in long term contracts, about 25% or so in one-year deals, and the 30% in tariff. And so, the long term contracts are fairly much done for the year, for 2009. Those will take effect January 1 for the most part and those are all completed.</p>
          <p>Many of the one-year deals are actually completed at this point, because they were in third and fourth quarter kinds of negotiations here. So my contractual business is pretty well locked in place for '09 right now. Again I have about 2% of legacy that will expire between January 1 and December 31 of '09; most of that at the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then on the business that isn't rolling over, so the contracts that are staying in place from '08 to '09. What types of escalation factors can we expect, or are built into those contracts right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's everything from the RCAF [rail cost adjustment factor] to the RCAF without fuel, with fuel surcharge on the ones that we have renegotiated with the new ones and then a variety of them have fixed percentages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Larkin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question about the EMP program in your domestic Intermodal operation. It looks like that really grew pretty dramatically during the quarter. I think you said up 29%. What is the state of that fleet? Are you upgrading it, expanding it, reducing it? It's quite interesting. You have a fairly different strategy than brand X has with regard to your own container equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our EMP fleet, we consider that to be a real opportunity working with the IMC community particularly the non-asset owners, that's where we're targeting that market. You look at our fleet today, I think going into the year we had like 19,000 containers. Hopefully by the end of year we will probably exit at around 21,000, 21,500 something like that, with a few retirements in and out.</p>
          <p>It's a great product offering particularly now with the domestic service that our operating team has provided. It's catching on a lot in terms of people taking a look at it and comparing that with truck and other options that they have. And we continue to think its going to be a great market opportunity for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're actually what, adding 2,000 boxes to the fleet over what time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year I think what we did is we probably added 3,500 and took out 1,500 retiree &#x2013; retirements I think is how. I think we ended up buying 53-footers and retired some 48-footers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you own the chassis as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the IMC is responsible for arranging the drayage is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can work both ways with them. We can offer to take that on and provide door to door service and they become just the sales agent or we'll just do ramp to ramp and allow them to do however they would like to deal with the direct door to door, ramp to door kinds of performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the growth in that business didn't seem to have much of a negative impact on the so called legacy domestic Intermodal business. Did that seem to grow also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our legacy Intermodal business, domestic Intermodal business also grew as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Interesting, okay. To the extent there's still an efficiency gap between what I'll call the old SP and the old Union Pacific, how many more years of capital expenditure and hard work will it take before that gap is completely closed to where you'd like to see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John we've made a good progress in terms of getting that property in better shape. There's still a few years left out here, when you look at some of the areas. But again you can't improve your velocity as we have seen in the overall network without having all of your properties starting to move up. And we still have some opportunities, we're looking at them. But again our long-term guidance we set on a low 70s operating ratio in the kind of financials. That will be part of that equation long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If it takes, say another two or three years to get that gap completely closed, the way you'd like to see it ultimately, does that imply that at the conclusion of that process, that perhaps your CapEx may drop down a little bit relative to say revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would, when you look at it. Again there's a certain amount of catch up that's in here. I don't see it as being substantial, when you look at it. And part of it, again, you have to separate maintenance and property that wasn't maintained to expansion. And a good example is double tracking the Sunset Corridor. Obviously we would have like to have that double tracked several years ago. But that's an ongoing project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And clearly there might be some small amount of incremental free cash flow to apply to share repurchases or increased dividends and that sort of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then one last question regarding the grain business. There's been a big drop in the dry bulk rates here over the last couple of months. Has that shifted any traffic from the PNW [Pacific Northwest] down to the Gulf and has that had an impact on your traffic flows and/or revenue outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably the most dramatic thing for us has been the bean harvest and so we've been moving a lot of soybeans from the current harvest down to the Gulf and that's been to our benefit. That's probably the place where we've seen it the most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But there is a still a fair amount moving to the PNW as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not a big player in the PNW. So we will follow wherever the grain wants to move. We will take advantage of the PNW, but right now it's the Gulf business that's kind of on a solid, steady foot for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about grain to the River, has there been an increase or a decrease in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That, it's been about flat, it's kind of hard to tell with all the disruptions we've had with hurricanes and things like that as to how much of that plays out but it's not growing substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you very much, that's very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our last question will be coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose. Please proceed with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of quick things here, one of your Eastern counterparts yesterday in their conference call talked about that they were getting more positive about pushing through that 25% expansionary tax credit. So I was wondering if you guys can give your thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jason where we're getting more positive is the perspective on the next round of stimulus coming out of the Hill and infrastructure strikes a chord with every member of Congress. And if you believe we have a &#x2013; I'd call it a crisis in transportation infrastructure in the U.S. and they look out the next five or ten years, I think it's a good opportunity here.</p>
          <p>We'll see what happens. I -- what I remind members is capital flows in terms of returns and if this helps maybe increase returns we may accelerate a little bit of capital. But I wouldn't take it to the bank yet, when you think about. I mean bottom line it's great jobs, it's investment in America when you think about where you're putting your money and we're prepared if it happens to probably do some things, but we'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jim on the outlook for '09, you mentioned potentially going down to about negative two on the volume side, is that assuming a little bit of economic slippage from here or is that assuming a steady state in what we're seeing in the economy now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we look at first half next year, you're going to see negative industrial production, negative GDP. We kind of look at it right now, it's probably about the run rate you're at right now going forward and then again some pickup towards the end. But we're prepared to manage our business in a very tough, tough economy next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my last one here on, on coal, you touched a little bit on maybe export demand for some of the Western coal. What are the ports that you're moving out of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today, it's Vancouver's, I guess it's called St. Roberts (sic) [Roberts Bank] we've also moved some off of Richmond and we've also moved some off of Long Beach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any other potential options for you on the West Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are looking for options, we are talking to all the ports and looking for some potential to see what would make most sense, but at least at this point in time those are kind of the three front runners.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
