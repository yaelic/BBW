          <p>Good morning.  I think it's hard to believe that everybody had gone away for summer but this has clearly not proven to be the case.  But I think hopefully summer begins after today, at least for some of us.</p>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to Prudential's 2009 Interim Results Presentation.  As you'll see today we've got a slightly broader agenda than normal.  What I want to do is kick off this morning with a short introduction before handing over to Tidjane to take you through a detailed financial review.</p>
          <p>We'll then have updates from Clark and Barry so that you can get a more hands-on view of what has happened in the U.S. and in Asia in 2009 so far.  And I'll finish off with my views on the outlook for the rest of the year.  As always we'll be happy to take your questions at the end and for that I'm joined by my colleagues from the Executive team over the front couple of rows.</p>
          <p>Let me first go to the results.  You can see that we've continued our very solid performance in what, as we all know, have been exceptionally challenging circumstances.  Bear in mind the prior year comparisons are being made with the period before the collapse of Lehman and AIG, before the credit crunch and before the onset of the most serious worldwide recession since the 1930s.  Quite a different world altogether.</p>
          <p>We said coming into 2009 with the prevailing economic uncertainty in mind that we'd take a very conservative approach to new business generation, balancing new business volumes with cash generation.  We also said that it was our top priority to make sure that our balance sheet and capital position remained robust.  And indeed that's exactly what we've focused on.</p>
          <p>In maintaining, or rather intensifying, our disciplined approach, we've been focusing the Group's new business production on the highest shareholder-value opportunities rather than on volume.  As a result, while new business sales were down 8%, much more importantly to us new business profit is ahead 25%.  And we've seen an increase in average margins at the Group level up from 38% to 52%.</p>
          <p>We've also seen very strong net inflows and superior investment performance in our Asset Management businesses, a truly exceptional combination.  Overall EEV operating profit was down 8% at 1.2 billion, but importantly IFRS operating profit was up by 6%.</p>
          <p>If we now turn to the very important subject of capital and cash, you can see from the slide that the estimated IGD surplus at the end of June is 2.5 billion, rising to three billion as a result of the hybrid we raised in July.  This is a very resilient and robust position and we believe it to be one of the strongest in industry and certainly one of the strongest in Europe with a solvency ratio of 262%.</p>
          <p>As Tidjane will talk about just a little bit later, we also continue to prioritize free surplus generation.  Overall there was an increase of around 900 million in that period.  And once again we were operating cash flow positive at the holding company level in the first half of 2009.  And as you've seen, we've increased the interim dividend by 5%, and that reinforces our confidence in the underlining earnings and cash generation of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Now what I'd like to do is just make a few comments about each of the businesses and the power of the franchise.  Let me start with Asia.  Right across the Asian region, we've seen a pretty dramatic shift in economic performance, especially in the more export-orientated economies.  We know we outperformed across the region in 2008 as far as sales are concerned.  And it is our belief and we estimate that this has also been the case in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>The building blocks that we put in place over the last 15 years or so have been very important in delivering this out performance.  We've made sure that we've got geographic spread, exceptionally advantaged distribution and a flexible and complete product range.  And these factors, together with a highly trusted brand and excellent people, have all played a central role in our success over this period.</p>
          <p>At the 2008 prelims, we showed you the clear benefits of protection coming through in our IFRS results throughout the region.  And more recently, Barry and the team have been driving the development of this business to new levels.  Looking forward, our strategic position gives us great flexibility.  And we remain absolutely confident about the long-term potential in Asia.</p>
          <p>To U.S.  Strategically the U.S. remains a very important market for us, with over $2 trillion of assets currently generating retirement income.  The combination of our strategy and our positioning means we are emerging from the 2008-2009 market dislocation as one of the clear winners.</p>
          <p>The backbone of our success has been to focus on advice-based distribution, product customization and our excellent product development.  These factors, together with operational flexibility, market-leading efficiency and the strength of Clark and his first-rate team, give us real competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>We've also been able to respond quickly and effectively to changing dynamics in consumer demand in the annuity markets.  The consistency of Jackson's strategy and product offering and the difficulties experienced by many of our competitors in the VA market have clearly played in our favor.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of the year, we've maintained a strong focus on capital preservation.  And we've only written highly profitable and capital-efficient business.  VA hedging has continued to perform well and as a result of our disciplined approach to capital, overall returns have been very strong.</p>
          <p>To the U.K.  As you know, Nick Prettejohn has decided to move on from the Group in September and he'll be succeeded by Rob Devey, who joins us from the Lloyds Banking Group.  Nick leaves a strong business, a very strong business for Rob to take over.  And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Nick for the really excellent job he's done and the leading role he's played in refocusing successfully our business in the U.K.</p>
          <p>It's a business that now is clearly based on its strength in annuities and with-profits and it's delivering market-leading margins and returns on new business.  At the same time we've taken head-on the issue of reducing policy count in the in-force book.  And there's also been a significant switch within our U.K. expense base from fixed to variable cost, which will of course prove very beneficial in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>From a Group perspective, the superior long-term investment performance of the with-profits fund and that fund's inherent financial strength continue to provide strong shareholder cash flows.  We remain on track for the shareholder business to break even in cash terms in 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally, but certainly not least, Asset Management.  Throughout the past 18 months, M&amp;G has shown the benefits of a business model that combines an emphasis on the development of a significant presence across all major asset classes with a culture of delivering consistently superior investment performance. Led by Michael, our strategy has paid dividends in both the retail and institutional markets in the U.K. and Europe.</p>
          <p>In the retail market, M&amp;G improved its position during the first half of this year in terms of both net inflows and funds under management.  Early indications are that we are number one in terms of both net inflow and fixed income funds under management at the end of June, a really impressive achievement.</p>
          <p>In Asia our approach to Asset Management is to build a multi-asset, multi-country model, which is scalable.  PCA Asset Management now manages a total of &#xA3;36 billion of funds across our Insurance businesses and on behalf of the external clients.  During the first half of the year we maintained Top-5 positions in a number of the most important markets in Asia.  And we've also been able to increase market share in the majority of those markets.</p>
          <p>So our message coming into 2009 had two key elements.  It was a message of caution and concern regarding the general economic and business climate, but it was also one of confidence in our strategy and our business model.  We've got a number of strong franchises.  Franchises are finally based on extracting value from the retirement opportunity in each of our chosen markets.</p>
          <p>Our operating principles have remained consistent and we believe that the geographic spread within the Group gives us excellent profit and risk diversification, as well as profitable options for growth.  And all of these factors have been in evidence during the market dislocation.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, and as you've heard me say on many occasions in the past, we've got a shareholder-value-driven approach delivering growth.  In addition to the action we've taken in the first six months of this year, we've strengthened our capital position very significantly and we've given ourselves additional flexibility from a capital perspective.</p>
          <p>With that let me hand over to Tidjane to take you through the detailed financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.  Before I deliver my usual financial review I would like to say a few words about some topics, which I know are on your minds ahead of my change of role on October 1.</p>
          <p>The first thing I would like to address is our strategy.  Mark has just reminded you of what we are aiming to achieve and why.  I voted with my feet when I decided to join the Pru in September 2007, almost two years ago, for what was a major career decision for me.  So I am totally aligned with this strategic vision and I have no plans to change the Group strategy.</p>
          <p>The second thing I would like to say is that my focus, as it has been since the day I joined the Pru, remains on execution and delivery.  We have the right strategy.  What we need to do is to continue to execute it successfully.  That will then result in the delivery of sustained superior performance.</p>
          <p>So now back to the financial review.  You are familiar with the way we have been presenting our performance with two key sections. First, our performance on our key financial metrics and second our approach to risk and capital management.</p>
          <p>As usual, all our prior year figures will be stated at actual exchange rates.  In addition, following the completion of the transfer of the Taiwan agency business in June '09 and to help comparisons, we have removed the results of this business from 2009 and from the 2008 comparatives throughout the presentation.</p>
          <p>After the financial review, I have asked Clark to cover with more granularity our U.S. performance, focusing on the trading environment, the credit book and our hedging program.  So I will not address those.  And I've also asked Barry to provide some more color on Asia.  And for those of you who are slightly worried, I have fewer slides than at the prelims.  I counted 37 at the prelims.  I only have 24 today.  It's a 35% decrease.</p>
          <p>My first slide is similar to the one I used at the prelims.  I continue to believe that the best way to create value over the long term in our business is to have a balanced approach and to keep an eye on EEV, IFRS and cash flow.  Over time those three measures should track each other.</p>
          <p>So at a Group level IFRS operating profit has increased 6% with a truly remarkable performance in Asia and I'll come back to that.  EEV operating profit was down 8%.  Within that, Life EEV operating profit was flat so most of the decrease was due to lower Asset Management profits and lower investment income, both as a result of market movements.</p>
          <p>I have introduced a new item on this page, free surplus.  As you know we have been using since the prelims movement in free surplus as a proxy for cash generation. In the first half free surplus increased by 932 million to almost 1.8 billion benefiting significantly from the Taiwan transaction.</p>
          <p>Finally, holding company cash flow remained positive at 22 million after paying an increased final dividend for 2008.  I'd like to stop here for a second because I'd like you to note that going forward I intend to use increasingly free surplus evolution to comment on cash flow generation, which I expect to increase over time.</p>
          <p>Holding company cash flow is mostly used to cover our progressive dividend and should be expected to balance close to zero after payment of the dividend, considering the many opportunities we have to write business profitably.  As this chart shows, and I had it done to scale, after dividend holding company cash flow is a small balancing item.  I will come back to this.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2008, faced with a very uncertain outlook, we focused on cash generation and capital preservation.  We developed our 2009 budget starting from the bottom with a cash and capital objective and treating sales like a residual, not like an objective.  In that context we decided to deliberately concentrate our sales efforts on the products with the highest IRRs and the shortest payback periods across our businesses.</p>
          <p>In a volatile environment this approach has served us well and has had a major impact on our new business profitability.  For the Group, new business profit has increased by 25% to 691 and average margins, as Mark said, from 38 to 52%.</p>
          <p>Taking it by region, in Asia we have achieved a strong increase in margins from 45 to 50%, thanks to our focus on protection and health.  In the period protection and health increased from 22% to 30% of APE.</p>
          <p>That increase in margins partially offset a 15% falling volume so that new business profit was down only 4% to 277.  Our payback period is four years, a very strong performance in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., new business profit has more than doubled.  I believe we made as much profit in the first half as in the whole of last year, say &#xA3;2 million.  Focusing on preserving capital we have not written any capital-intensive institutional business in the first half.  And we don't anticipate writing any in the second half either.</p>
          <p>We have achieved an IRR in excess of 20%, and a payback period of just two years.  We have benefited from the organic consolidation underway in variable annuities, and Clark will talk about that, and done really well in fixed annuities as well with lower volumes but higher market share.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., margins increased from 29 to 32% with new business profit down 5% due to lower volumes.  The payback period of new business in the U.K. was five years.  And returns in excess of 15% are market leading.</p>
          <p>In total, the average Group IRR was comfortably above 20%, one of the highest in the industry and well above our cost of capital, with attractive payback periods.  So let's now look at how much we have had to invest to generate those new business profits I just described.</p>
          <p>We have two main rules when deciding where and how much to invest in new business acquisition. First, we managed with the total strain, not strain as percentage of APE.  It is the total strain that we control and that has a direct impact on our cash flows and our long-term value creation potential.</p>
          <p>Second, in normal market conditions we would allocate marginal capital primarily to Asia, as that is where we believe our highest returns and our highest Group opportunities are and will remain in the long-term.</p>
          <p>Let's look out at the evolution for each half-year over the last 18 months.  I said at the interims that to preserve capital and cash I would manage our new business strain closer to levels seen in prior years as it had exceptionally reached 806 million in '08, significantly higher than 500 in '07.</p>
          <p>There was effectively a significant increase in the second half of '08, as you can see in the H2 '08 bar here, driven by our investment in the U.K. and mainly related to a Cable &amp; Wireless bulk, which had a premium of just over one billion and a strain of 94 million.</p>
          <p>Our decision not to write bulk business in H1 '09 in the U.K., together with the beneficial impact of increased with-profit sales and our disciplined approach to pricing annuities, has reduced strain significantly as you can see.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our new business sales were lower than planned this year.  There was less demand for capital than we expected.  Therefore we decided deliberately to allow our investment in the U.S. to increase temporarily above our initial plans, in order to take advantage of IRRs in excess of 20% with a two-year payback period available at the point in the business cycle where our competition had decreased markedly.</p>
          <p>So overall in H1 we have managed to control very effectively our new business strain whilst at the same time shifting to a higher-margin product mix and generating higher new business profits.  So that's all I wanted to say about new business.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at EEV operating profit.  EEV operating profit for the Group is down 8%.  And before we look at the detail of this evolution it is important to note that for our Group at this half-year there were no major assumption changes or large operating variances.  They represented in total 0.5% of the opening value of in-force.</p>
          <p>So looking at it more closely, you can see that the overall operating profit from the Life businesses, as shown on the right hand of the slide, was flat.  Our very strong new business performance allowed us to offset the decrease we did experience in in-force profits.</p>
          <p>Experience variances and assumption changes had a negative impact of 64 million, a good performance in the context of an in-force value of 958 &#x2013; nine billion, almost 10 billion at the start of the year.  This resulted from a combination of positive experience variances of 13 million and of negative operating assumption changes of 77 million.</p>
          <p>As you know, in-force performance is crucial in our business.  It is as an area of intense focus for me and this will continue.</p>
          <p>Overall losses in Asia were partially offset by gains in the U.S. and in the U.K.  In that context, it is important to note that Asia has grown from 20% of our embedded value in '04 to 38% at this half year, major evolution.  In H1 embedded values have held up well in most of our Asian territories, in spite of significant financial and economic disruptions.</p>
          <p>However we had a specific issue in Korea related to premium holidays.  And we have deliberately taken a cautious approach to the issue and change our operating assumptions to a very conservative level.  And Barry will give you more detail on that when he talks about Asia later.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the profit from Asset Management and other operations of 152 million.  M&amp;G and our Asset Management business in Asia have continued to attract significant net flows.  Profits unsurprisingly have declined compared to the first half of 2008, when equity markets were at much higher average levels.</p>
          <p>The adverse conditions in the commercial property market and lower investment income have also had a negative effect on M&amp;G.  On the positive side you can see that the GI commissions in the U.K. increased to 27 million.</p>
          <p>The third and last factor in the evolution of the EEV operating profit is what we call OIE, other income and expenses.  Here we have experienced a 63 million deterioration over the first half of 2008, mainly due to lower investment income on centrally held funds as short-term interest rates fell during the first half of this year.  So to summarize, in a challenging environment we have demonstrated the resilience of our EEV operating profit.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the balance sheet and shareholder funds, they decreased by 8% in the period to 13.7 billion.  Operating profits added 1.246 million (sic) [billion], so it's good to remember that operating profit's always a good source of capital.</p>
          <p>Below the operating line, short-term investment fluctuations were negative 491, mainly due to losses and impairments related to the U.S. debt securities and to the effect of a negative 1% return on the U.K. with-profit fund, compared to our long-term assumption of 3.3% for the half year, 6.6% for the full year if you annualize.</p>
          <p>Reporting within short-term fluctuations, we also incurred one-off IGD hedging costs of 260 million. I will come back to this in the capital section later.</p>
          <p>Economic assumption changes were negative 384, two thirds of this was in the U.K.  And on an EEV basis, as previously indicated, we made a profit on the sale of a Taiwan agency business, reported here as 91 million.</p>
          <p>Finally during the period, sterling strengthened considerably against almost all currencies generating this time negative FX movements of 1,104, bringing us down to the 13.7 I mentioned in the beginning.</p>
          <p>So, so much for EEV, let's now talk about IFRS.  This slide sets out the evolution of a major component of IFRS operating profit, which increased by 6% to 688 million.  Within that, the operating profit for the Life businesses increased by 26% to 732.  The movements in Asset Management, other businesses and Group-related items are similar to what I just described under EEV, so I will not repeat here my earlier comments.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on the Life business operating profit on the next chart.  Starting from the bottom of the chart with Asia in red, profit has almost trebled with an underlying increase of 99%, or simply a doubling, if we exclude the 63 million one-off gain due to the implementation of risk-based capital regime in Malaysia.  Given the emphasis we have put on insuring that our IFRS earnings in Asia track our EEV earnings more closely, these are particularly pleasing result.</p>
          <p>What explains this Asian performance?  At the prelims I highlighted the importance of Insurance margin in Asia versus fee and spread.  We have continued to benefit strongly from our profitable growth in health and protection.  We have also benefited from the slowdown in sales, which led to a 24 million decrease in new business strain on an IFRS basis.  And you'll see an appendix describing that.  Went from 71 to 47 million.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. profits were down 6% compared to H1 due to a number of factors, including: lower fee income from our separate account, the VA account business, reflecting lower account balances; the non-recurrence of hedging gains we achieved in H1 '08 and the increased cost of hedging in H1'09; and also, on the positive side, improvements in mortality profits reflecting positive experience in the period.</p>
          <p>Finally in the U.K., profit was up 11% on H1 '08 due to two main factors.  One, our shareholder-backed annuity business contributed an additional 55 million in the period as a result of a disciplined approach to pricing of annuities, and because there are also more shareholder assets earning an investment return.</p>
          <p>The second factor is the shareholder transfer from the with-profit fund, which as you can see fell by 51 million in the period, reflecting the impact of the bullish rate reductions already announced earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>So on this metric again the key message is that we have been able to deliver a strong and resilient performance throughout the market dislocations of 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Let us now look at IFRS shareholders fund.  The opening shareholders funds were 5.1 billion.  We added again 688 million of operating profit, as I've described.  Short-term fluctuations were positive 136 and we've shown here the breakout those by the composition by region.</p>
          <p>As in EEV, there is a one-off charge for exceptional IGD hedge cost of 216.  The sale of the Taiwan business generated a loss of 621 million.  And moving on to changes for equity, the unrealized loss position has improved, leading to a gain of 423 million net of DAC and tax.  And I will come back to this later also.</p>
          <p>Dividends net of scrip were 226.  Foreign exchange movements were negative 298, to give a closing shareholders funds of 4.7 billion.</p>
          <p>I've talked about the growth in Asian IFRS profits, very important.  We gave you reserve movement information in the 2008 pack but I did include it in the main presentation.  This time I'd like to illustrate it and use a slide on this topic. The slide shows you reserve development from the shareholder business in Asia in the first six months of the year. This is an alternative way of looking at the development of in-force and at the potential for growth in cash flows and earnings.</p>
          <p>Reversing out the Taiwan agency business from opening reserves and normalizing for exchange rates to see the underlying trend, you can see that the Asian shareholder business had net inflows of 972 million or 12.3% of opening reserves in one six-months period, or 26% annualized.</p>
          <p>This is driven by strong business sales and, importantly, also by the growing book of regular premiums from existing customers, a true strength of our Asian business.  During '08 as a whole, we had net inflows of 20% of opening reserves in Asia.  This is more evidence, if needed, of the quality of the growth and of the earnings power of our Asian platform.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to cash, cash and capital.  As you know, I've been emphasizing free surplus, which I feel is a useful proxy for underlying cash flow generation.  You probably remember this slide.  It's just a reminder of the color coding in the following slides, the fact that the sources of free surplus are in red, we are a red company, Prudential, uses are in blue and stocks are in gray.</p>
          <p>So the next slide shows you the movement in free surplus for all of our operating businesses, that's Life and Asset Management, in the first half of the year.  At the beginning of '09, the opening free surplus was 859 on the left here.  During the first half, our operations generated 912 million of underlying free surplus.  And that's a number I'd like you to takeaway from this presentation, half year 912 million of free surplus generated with 241 million of other movements.</p>
          <p>If we move now to the blue, the uses of free surplus, starting with an item largely under our control, new business strain.  We decided to invest 331 million to write new business and you recognize the 331 we talked about earlier.  And it was 220 of capital and 111 of expenses.</p>
          <p>Here's actually key to understanding how we navigated for H1'09.  Back in Q4 '08 we decided that we would contain our new business strain and flex it depending on the evolution of the economic environment, which at that point was very hard to predict.  Containing this new business strain is going to remain an important feature of how we manage the Group.</p>
          <p>In the same period, market-related items, including FX, reduced free surplus by 502 million leaving us with a free surplus of 1,179.  Therefore free surplus generated by the operations after investment in new business and after market movement increased by 320 million.</p>
          <p>You can then see, we isolated that, the benefit of the transfer of the Taiwan agency business at 987.  And the next item is to upstream 375 million of cash to the holding company to meet corporate needs and that's where you go back to the holding company cash flow.</p>
          <p>So the net impact of all these movements is to leave us with a free surplus of 1,791 at June 30, on the right of the slide.  Just to put this in perspective, that 1,791 represents a 300 million increase over June '08.</p>
          <p>And it's useful to remember what happened in the meantime.  We have absorbed 1.5 billion of adverse market movements and credit reserve strengthening, we have used 787 million to write new business and upstreamed 556 million to the Group.</p>
          <p>So we believe that having stayed at the same level net is quite an achievement and demonstrates the strength of our operations and their ability to generate significant amount of free surplus even through one of the worst markets in decades.</p>
          <p>I would like now to show you the evolution of our holding company cash flow over four years and how the Group uses the cash remitted from the Life and Asset Management free surplus, as described in the previous slide.  A few comments here, dividend to Group from the businesses is at 375 million.  It's in blue here.</p>
          <p>The holding company cash flow pre-dividend, the red bar, has grown from '06 to '08 and is roughly flat '08 over '09 &#x2013; '09 over '08.  The cash cost of the dividend net of scrip has increased to 226.  And hence there is a lower residual of 22 million, compared to 86 million in '08.</p>
          <p>A key point to take away here, holding company cash flow is useful to think about our ability to meet corporate needs and particularly to pay for dividend, whereas free surplus is relevant to analyze the cash flow generation ability of the Group.  Therefore we do not need to upstream cash from the operating businesses to the Group over and above that required to meet corporate needs.</p>
          <p>One should not expect the holding company cash flow to increase beyond what is needed to pay a progressive dividend.  As the Group has significant scope to invest capital at very strong returns, I said 20% overall from the Group, above &#x2013; significantly above 20%, due to our unique strategic position.</p>
          <p>So this is probably a good place to say a little more on the dividend-paying capacity of the Group. First, let me say that we look at the dividend and at its progression across the economic cycle, which leads to very large impacts, positive or negative, like we've been seeing now for two years.</p>
          <p>We're showing here, the underlying free surplus generation before market impacts, which are cyclical by nature and can obscure the underlying picture.  Set against that are the uses of free surplus that are under our control, how much we invest in new business, how much we spend at the corporate level and how much we pay in dividend.</p>
          <p>This slide shows that we have set our dividend at a level that is such that the net position in all periods is positive.  We have also included this information in the appendix for the full year, as this is only half year.</p>
          <p>Given the underlying capacity to generate free surplus, the strength of the capital position we have built, the absolute quantum of our dividend and the very strong liquidity we have centrally, we remain confident that we can support a progressive dividend through the economic cycle on reasonable assumptions.</p>
          <p>So to summarize on performance, as we said we would, we have focused on capital and cash preservation.  And as a direct consequence, we have seen all our metrics for new business profitability, absolute profits, margin, IRR and payback improve.</p>
          <p>The performance of the back book across the Group has remained robust.  IFRS profits have held up well, with a particularly pleasing increase in Asia.  And the ability of our business to generate free surplus remains and has allowed us to absorb significant adverse market movements in '08 and '09.</p>
          <p>So let's move now to the second section, capital and risk, starting with solvency.  The key considerations on solvency as ever are the absolute level of the surplus, our ability to generate capital and its resilience or, if you prefer, its sensitivity.  In absolute terms, it's good to put this in perspective.  Our IGD surplus is up one billion from 1.5 billion as of December 31 to 2.5 billion as of June 30.</p>
          <p>Pro forma and including the hybrid raised in July, our IGD surplus has doubled over a robust six months to three billion with an IGD cover of 262%.  In addition, U.K. the credit reserve remains at &#xA3;1.4 billion.  This has already been expensed, as you know, and acts as an additional IGD capital buffer.</p>
          <p>The free surplus analysis I showed you, but our underlying capital generation is strong, a key source of IGD capital.  In terms of sensitivity, we set our risk appetite, i.e. the level of volatility in the surplus that we are willing to accept, so as to optimize the trade-off between the cost of raising additional capital and the cost of hedging various risks.</p>
          <p>We have generally built our strategy and hedging programs to optimize economic outcomes, confident that in the long run across the cycle, they are more important than short-term accounting impact.</p>
          <p>I said earlier that I would come back to the specific IGD hedge.  In Q1, you will recall that equity market levels had fallen significantly and volatilities were at historically high levels, between 50 and 80 &#x2013; equity volatilities.  At that point, our sensitivity to extreme tail events, such as an immediate one-day fall in the market of 40% with no recovery, had become very high on an IGD basis at a time when we had an IGD surplus of 105 billion.  And I do remember those days.</p>
          <p>Therefore we took the decision to put in place a one-off hedge, in addition to our continuous operational hedges, to protect the IGD surplus against tail events due to the market dislocation until such time that we would have strengthened our IGD position.  Having significantly increased the IGD surplus through management action such as the sale of the Taiwan agency and the issuance of hybrid debt in May and July, we are now comfortable that we will not need to renew this exceptional IGD hedge.  The residual sensitivities that we have presented here sit comfortably within our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>The final topic I would like to address in this financial review is the asset side of our balance sheet. We have, as you know, 180 billion of invested assets of which 53 billion our shareholder-backed.  Overall we have seen our 41 billion debt portfolio perform well in the first half of the year across our businesses.</p>
          <p>Defaults totaled 11 million and losses on sale were 42 million i.e. just 13 basis point of the total credit portfolio.  In addition, we have taken IFRS impairments of three to four million in the U.S., giving a total credit charge of 377 million for the period.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, and as I referred to earlier, our net unrealized loss position has improved significantly.  Starting from 2.9 billion at the end of '08, it had moved out to 3.2 billion as you remember at Q1 and has now moved back to 1.8 billion at June 30.</p>
          <p>And a note on this slide, sorry, I just got the numbers yesterday, but the unrealized losses position at the end of July was estimated at 1.1 billion from the 1.8 that you see here, strengthening our net asset value by about &#xA3;0.10.  Within this, corporate are now net positive, I'm talking end of July.  Corporate are now net positive, no unrealized losses on the corporate portfolio, I believe a remarkable moment in this credit cycle.</p>
          <p>So I would like to say few words now here about the U.K. where we have a significant portion of our exposure to credit risk.  The U.K. credit portfolio remains of high quality with 78% invested in assets A-rated or above and 96% investment grade.</p>
          <p>Defaults on the portfolio were 11 million, as I said earlier, and there were no net realized losses. The credit spread on the portfolio has reduced from 323 basis points at the end of '08 to 275 at June 30.  However, we have not reduced our reserves to reflect this tightening.  Instead we have retained the existing provision, plus the positive experience that emerged in the period, and not taken it as profit.</p>
          <p>The Pillar 1 and EEV assumption is now 85 basis point per annum, which is equivalent to 31% of the June 30 spread.  Remember that our previous position was 80-basis point and 25% of the spread, so the position has strengthened.</p>
          <p>And the credit reserve remains intact at 1.4 billion. We continue to set our IFRS credit assumptions at prudent levels.  And again the positive experience in the period has been retained.</p>
          <p>In a moment Clark will give you a detailed update on the U.S. credit portfolio and there is more information in the appendix.  We have provided you with a number of schedules aligned with the ones I presented at the prelims but I wasn't allowed to present them this time.</p>
          <p>So I just did not think it was &#x2013; anyway, in summary my key messages are: that we have continued to deliver strong operating performance; we have executed well our strategy of cash generation and capital preservation; we have maintained our prudent and proactive approach to risk and capital management, achieving a very strong IGD position.</p>
          <p>Mark has built around him an exceptionally strong team and I have every confidence that we are well equipped to continue to outperform our competition.  And this is the part when my script ends and everybody gets nervous but I'd just like to say something on a personal note.  Those who know Mark know that he has a great sense of humor and he made, I think, his worst joke this year because he claims that the day he told me that he was leaving, I turned white.  I'm afraid it's true.</p>
          <p>So he will allow me to make him blush a little because he hates compliments but I'm going to make him a compliment.  I just think he's been a great CEO for this company.  We've been through interesting times together and those are times when you learn to know a person, when we were looking at IGDs around 700 or 800 million and share prices going down 29% on the day.</p>
          <p>So I know Mark well, I believe.  He's been a great CEO.  He's a great person.  He's been a great boss for me and I just wanted to say, Mark, really well done.  Thank you and good luck in whatever you do next.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much and I'll let Clark continue.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tidjane.  Been an interesting half-year in the U.S. markets.  Starting with the baby-boomer story, only two things have changed.  Their homes are worth 30 to 45% less than two years ago and their retirement plan assets are down about 40%.  Meanwhile retirement gets closer by the day and there's a clear need to replenish and increase savings.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've seen a number of providers pull back from the U.S. VA market in one way or another.  These trends clearly benefit Jackson, as we have long-standing relationships across the independent advisor channel that allow us to promote the importance and value of guarantees, and hence our variable annuities, our core product.</p>
          <p>We're benefiting from a substantial flight to quality in the VA market as advisors and investors seek out the most disciplined carriers.  As a result, we achieved the highest VA sales in company history in the first half, up 40% in sterling or 6% in dollars, over first half 2008.  And we estimate that market share was over 7.5% in the second quarter and over 8% in June.</p>
          <p>Far from behaving aggressively, we were able to achieve these record results while also increasing margins from 49% in 2008 to 71% in 2009.  The increase was a result of a number of factors, including revised pricing of the benefits and increased spread in the fixed account options.</p>
          <p>From a risk-management perspective, there's a stark contrast between those who say VAs are an unprofitable, unhedgeable business and our risk-management philosophy, which has led to the hedging gains we've reported since the beginning of this cycle.</p>
          <p>It has not been our strategy to compete on price, nor get involved in the feature-fest.  And we were willing to lose market share during 2007 and 2008, as you see from the chart.  Our current market share gains demonstrate that we are now reaping the benefits of our conservatism as Jackson is increasingly seen by distributors as a must-have writer.</p>
          <p>Moving to fixed annuities, our focus in the first half was value over volume.  Unlike the growth in VA sales, FA sales have been managed down 17% in dollar terms compared to the first half of 2008 as we looked to conserve capital.</p>
          <p>The margins, IRR and payback at which the business was written in the first half of the year were extremely attractive.  Our APE margin on the fixed line increased by 40 percentage points from the end of 2008.  We recognize that this unusually high level is unsustainable, but we're taking and booking profitable sales that will generate strong IFRS earnings and cash flows going forward.</p>
          <p>The increase in margins was partly a result of a slightly higher achieved yield on new assets with the average quality of 2009 asset purchases at single A, which is consistent with the first half of 2008.  Margins were more significantly positively impacted as a result of us reducing the credited rate on new sales to well below the current industry average, as you see from this chart.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that we protect the value in-force and decrease vulnerability to surrenders by selling products with a six to 9% surrender charge in the first year.  Further, market value adjustment provisions on many of the products insulate Jackson from changes in interest rates and help us protect future persistency.</p>
          <p>While we're on the subject of fixed annuities I'll say a few words about our credit portfolio.  As you know, we have a &#xA3;21 billion portfolio of debt securities in the U.S.  Impairments on an IFRS basis are significantly lower in the first half of 2009 compared to the second half of 2008.  This is in part due to the spike in corporate defaults and impairments, mainly relating to financials around the time of the Lehman collapse last September.</p>
          <p>In addition, as Tidjane mentioned, unrealized losses reduced significantly in the second quarter. One thing you'll notice though is the increase in the impairments of the RMBS securities.  And so I thought I'd give you a little more color on that.</p>
          <p>We have &#xA3;3.4 billion of RMBS, of which &#xA3;2.2 billion is agency-guaranteed and &#xA3;155 million is subprime.  In the first half, 17.5 million in impairments was taken on the subprime portfolio.  The remaining exposure is Alt-A and prime, of which &#xA3;750 million is senior and &#xA3;314 million is non-senior.</p>
          <p>We're seeing some contagion into the 2005 issues from the 2006/2007 due to the length of the economic downturn, which is now about 19 months in duration.  Whereas the 2006/07 vintages were characterized by poor underwriting, with unemployment at a 25-year high of 9.4%, we're now seeing an increase in delinquency from borrowers who previously could afford their homes but have now come under more difficult personal economic times.  The duration of the downturn and the length of time for which unemployment remains at these levels will determine the ultimate extent of the contagion to prior year RMBS.</p>
          <p>The split of senior and non-senior is an important point, although 70% of the prime and Alt-A portfolio is in senior tranches.  The importance of this is that although we may see some losses in these bonds, the losses will be contained.</p>
          <p>In a typical RMBS structure the non-AAA tranches are relatively thin, so that as collateral losses increase, non-AAA tranches can be hit very hard.  The senior AAA tranche on the other hand is very wide.  And thus the actual economic loss is much more contained and much lower than the current price declines that are driving reported accounting values. There's a chart in the appendix that sets this out.</p>
          <p>I'll now say a few words about hedging VA guarantees, which I know is a topic of interest to many of you. First of all, we do our hedging on a macro basis, that is we hedge residual economic exposures after taking into account all the substantial natural offsets within our book. As an example, with the current makeup of our liabilities, the offsets from the fixed index annuity portfolio is approximately one-third of our VA equity exposure.</p>
          <p>Jackson is typically fully hedged for a 10 to 20% instantaneous market move using options. Dynamic hedging is employed to fine-tune our exposure around the 10 to 20% range or when option based instruments are not economically viable.  Frequent rebalancing mitigates the impact of larger moves that occur over time.</p>
          <p>We pre-hedged a portion of our 2008 sales when options were historically inexpensive in late 2007. When implied volatility increased in 2008, a larger component of dynamic hedging was employed to complement the core option based program to manage through a period of severe market instability.  We anticipate moving back to a traditional option based approach once volatility reduces, so dynamic hedging can result in accounting losses in the interim.</p>
          <p>Finally, our hedging program covers all embedded VA guarantees, as well as the fees related to them.  A few, if any, of our competitors take such a conservative approach.  Having described how we approach hedging, I now want to cover the performance over the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>It's been a very profitable environment and our hedging has held up very well. The right-hand side of this chart shows the VA hedging performance over the last 18 months and note that I will briefly switch into dollars.</p>
          <p>In 2008 we had a $177 million IFRS gain in part due to our pre-funded hedge position. In the first half of 2009 we posted a $52 million loss, which nets to a $125 million IFRS profit over the past 18 months.</p>
          <p>On a statutory basis, which determines our regulatory capital, we made a profit of $28 million on hedging in the first half of 2009. Over the 18-month period the statutory results were a positive $177 million. Unlike many of our competitors, basis risk has been a moderate positive over this period as our funds in aggregate have performed slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe these results reflect Jackson's well-defined risk management program and validate the economic-based hedging program that we've discussed at these meetings over the last several years. It is a combination of outstanding distribution and prudent risk management that's allowed Jackson to grow the variable annuity book, while less disciplined competitors are retrenching.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, I'd like to give you an idea of Jackson's priorities over the next several periods. Our first priority is to continue to grow the VA book profitably. The value to customers of the guarantees that we provide has never been more apparent, nor has our customers need to repair their own balance sheets.</p>
          <p>We're already seeing a major shift in customer demand from fixed back to variable annuities and we expect this to continue. We will be increasing our distribution footprint and will continue to hedge our own balance sheet conservatively.</p>
          <p>Our second priority is to manage fixed and fixed index annuities for value. These products have higher new business strain than VAs and with our limited capital appetite at present, we'll seek to maximize IRRs and minimize payback periods rather than simply chasing volumes.</p>
          <p>Lastly, market turmoil will create opportunities for inorganic growth and in Jackson's case we view this is an opportunity to diversify our sources of income beyond spread and fee business.  While some larger deals may seem attractive at face value, we remain committed to our bolt-on strategy which takes advantage of our low cost scalable single platform and was most recently demonstrated by the Life of Georgia deal.</p>
          <p>While nothing is eminent, we consistently explore our options, but we'll not deviate from the efficient bolt-on acquisition model that served us well in the past. We believe that the financial turmoil has changed the U.S. Life market in a way that plays to Jackson's strengths and I look forward to telling you more about it in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand you over to Barry, who will give you more color on the performance in Asia over the last six months. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clark. Tidjane and Mark have shared with you this morning the details our first half performance in Asia. It is a strong performance in a challenging economic environment.  I'd like to take a few moments to share with you some additional context around this performance.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, given the severity of the economic disruption in Asia, absolute sales levels are below those of 2008 by 15%.  However, they are 16% above 2007, which was, as you will recall, a transformational year for Prudential in Asia and it is worth noting that sales of recurring premium products are down only 7% on 2008 and that sales of protection products are up more than 17%. You will be sufficiently familiar with the results of our regional competitors to appreciate that this is consistent with our track record of outperformance.</p>
          <p>We continue to hold top three positions in most markets where we operate and we are the market leader in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and in Malaysia, including our Takaful business, so we are clearly better positioned than any of our competitors in the region.  In those very instances where we have given up share, it is based upon our unwillingness to engage in pricing or distribution techniques that make no sense for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We have not and will not manufacture loss leader products. We have not and will not pay excessive compensation to distributors or work with distributors who do not write quality business.  Now this naturally leads us to a discussion of how we have done what we have done in Asia.</p>
          <p>It's very important to understand how different organizations have responded to the economic crisis. Some have made it clear that their priority is short-term market share gains and they've done whatever that they've had to do in an effort, often a futile effort, to boost absolute sales levels.</p>
          <p>In contrast, Prudential's first half performance was achieved by focusing on high margin recurring premium products and by continuing to aggressively drive the protection element of our product mix, just as we have repeatedly told you that we would. This resulted in an improvement in new business margin from 45.5% to 50.3%.</p>
          <p>We've spent a great deal of time over the last few years talking about our value over volume proposition. If you ever had any doubts about how serious we are about this, about how disciplined we are as an organization, then our first half results should put those doubts to rest.</p>
          <p>I think it's also very important to note that our sales volumes and our margins are driving results not just for Prudential shareholders, but also for over 400,000 Prudential agents who are weathering this storm and who are uniquely well positioned to take advantage of improvements in consumer sentiment in Asia.</p>
          <p>You've heard me say before that organizations that are serious about Asia must be serious about agency. We remain committed to agency distribution. It is the largest element of our unparalleled multi-channel distribution platform, a platform that represents a greater competitive advantage to us today than at any time in our history.</p>
          <p>Moving on, I'd like to spend a moment on our EEV operating profit, where we have reported some adverse assumption changes and experience variances. Relative to the total embedded value in the region, these adjustments are small and movements of this type are not surprising given the scale and diversity of our business.</p>
          <p>You see from the chart that persistency is the main component of the &#xA3;124 million in adverse impact and that the principal driver of this is Korea. While Korea represents only 6% of our embedded value in the region, it represents over a third of the variances and assumption changes.</p>
          <p>We've seen an uptick in cases where linked policyholders in Korea have elected a premium holiday. These policies have not lapsed, instead policyholders funds are used to pay the insurance charges &#x2013; the insurance charges related to these policies. While the premium holiday feature is designed to allow for a temporary suspension of premium payments, as Tidjane said, we've taken a very prudent approach and have assumed that none of these policies will generate any further premium. Of course, if our actual experience proves better than this, positive adjustment will be made in future reporting periods.</p>
          <p>And while Korea is contributing disproportionately to the EEV changes, it should be noted that we have seen some increases in premium holidays in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as some partial fund withdrawals in India.  EEV operating profit is a key priority for us and management takes aggressive action to deal with variances, such as these we've described today, when they arise.</p>
          <p>For example, in Korea, we've undertaken a coordinated campaign using our call center capabilities and our agency force to reach out to customers and encourage them to resume payment of premiums. Already we are seeing signs of improvement as a result of these activities.</p>
          <p>Let's move on now to the outlook for the future. No one is ready to suggest the economic crisis is over, but neither is anyone suggesting that Asia's medium to long term prospects are anything other than positive. In fact, the latest data suggests that Asia is recovering more quickly than the rest, with stronger GDP growth forecasts.</p>
          <p>Equally significant is the recent out-performance of Asian equity markets and the positive impact this is having on consumer sentiment, so the fundamentals of Asia remain unchanged: Strong economic growth; demographic and social changes that work to our advantage; a growling mass affluent class; positive consumer disposition towards savings and protection products; and Prudential's position and prospects in Asia are unchanged as well.</p>
          <p>This slide is familiar to you, you've seen it many times before and it tells a compelling story. We remain uniquely well placed in terms of our presence, our trusted brand, our scale, our core product and distribution competencies, our disciplined focus on value for shareholders.  As I said, no one is ready to suggest the crisis has run its course, but I would like to close by calling to your attention some encouraging trends.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter sales levels were well ahead of the first quarter in many key markets, including Hong Kong, which was up 15%; Indonesia, which is up 21%; Malaysia, which is up 33%; and Singapore, which is up 45%. Collectively, these four markets generate about half of our APE and an even higher proportion of our new business profit and these trends are continuing.</p>
          <p>Our distribution platform is also growing. In the second quarter we recruited over 40,000 new agents in Asia, ex-India, representing a 50% increased over recruitment levels in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me finished by saying that times like these tend to punish mediocrity and reward excellence. There can be little doubt that Prudential is being rewarded for our discipline and that we are building upon our position of undisputed regional leadership.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Barry. Let me move on now just to a single page summary and outlook before we go into Q&amp;As. While the business environment is expected to remain difficult in 2009, we are very confident that we will continue to deliver against our consistent and compelling strategy.</p>
          <p>We have a business model that is both advantaged and flexible and that has proven its resilience. We are wonderfully well positioned to take advantage of any market upturn and we will remain focused on the most profitable opportunities and we have a management team that has made and will continue to make a series of clear sighted decisions and proactive moves to improve the positioning of the Group.</p>
          <p>Finally and on a personal note, I'd like say that it has been an honor, a privilege and a pleasure to lead the Group over the 4.5 years. I take great pride in what we as a team have achieved and I have every confidence that Prudential, under Tidjane's strong leadership, will continue to go from strength to strength.</p>
          <p>Thank you and we'd be happy to take any questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions if I may. Firstly, could you comment a little about how you're managing the distributor relationships?  You seem to be being far more dynamic in how you're managing the sales mix in all the categories really. And how you're sort of managing that relationship? Second, what is your appetite for bulk annuity business in the U.K. going forward?  I just wondered on the U.S., could you comment a little bit on the statutory capital metrics in terms of where the statutory capital was at the end of the first half and if you could give an RBC ratio, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clark, can I ask you to do that in reverse, talk about the statutory capital and also talk about distributor relationships?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with statutory capital, RBC, yes, about RBC, we've not disclosed an RBC number. RBC is a year-end calculation and there's a lot of rules that are up in the air and being implemented this year. If I talk about development of statutory capital though and things that might impact RBC ratio as we move into year end, if you look at total adjusted capital in the U.S., it is down $300 million since the beginning of the year. 200 million of that traces back directly to the IGD hedge and 100 million to just the normal development of the book. And if you look at year-end it's &#x2013; or if you look at the second quarter rather, it's about flat, so it had stopped declining. The underlying earnings on the business were offsetting any damage coming through from impairments in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Downgrades have impacted the denominator of the ratio and it will continue to.  Our C-1 factor in our denominator has increased by about $160 million and then you offset that by about 20%, reduce that by about 20% for a covariance factor, and that's still out there. You have AG 43 out there.  Impact of AG 43 at current market levels would be essentially nothing, that's not true at all market levels. And there's a disconnect between AG 43 and C-3 Phase II that has to be worked through.  But all of that appears to be manageable. So you've got some things going on in the denominator that we're working on. The numerator is absolute capital. Ratios are holding up pretty well.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right now SAP 98 would come into effect for the RMBS portfolio at the end of the third quarter.  And what that would effectively do is bring fair value impairments to RMBS. Us, a lot of the industry and now increasingly regulators are thinking that doesn't make much sense as opposed to going to what would be more of a yield maintenance standard approximately, rough and ready explanation marking these things to something approximating the yield at which you bought them if there's an impairment as opposed to marking them all the way to fair value. That is SAP 43R.  That seems to have a lot of support developing that would clearly be very beneficial for RMBS security impairments for us and for the industry.</p>
          <p>And distribution relationships in the U.S., we think we've been in the right place through this.  The advice-based advisors are going to come out of this stronger than ever because people are going to be looking for advice more than ever. There has been a lot of disruption of the product providers servicing that channel. For the first time in my career there is more distributors than there is product, where normally that relationship has been inverted. If you look at the top ten providers of VAs, five of them are clearly badly disrupted and other ones are somewhat, let's say, disorganized in their ability to execute, so we have gained from that.</p>
          <p>We also have gained from disruptions in other independent broker dealer networks owned by product providers who now are wondering why they were providing the products that they were providing through those channels. And so the reps have become available and as a result we've increased the rep count in NPH from about 3,000 a year ago to about 3,500 now, so very good recruiting there at good economics for us. And at the same time we've seen our percentage of house brand sales through NPH increase dramatically, similar to what we've seen for our overall market share.</p>
          <p>And I'd say the other trend to watch is that other distribution channels that we were not interested in before have become more available to us. So we are looking at possibilities of relationships in the wire house where heretofore we have not tried to play. But they don't really have house brand product that they can push anymore. And they're becoming more planning oriented and their overall, let's say, tariffs and persistency behaviors improved.  As well as because of the product shelf space inversion, large banks may now be available to us, but heretofore we were not willing to pay the economics required to get our products on those shelves. So we have a lot of interesting things going on, on the distribution side right now.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, if you want a long answer, he'll do that later. Barry, just talk about Asia distributors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I wouldn't characterize what's going on in Asia with respect to distribution as being any sort of significant change. We're still focused on building, in most markets, the scale of agency distribution with an intense focus on improving the productivity in agency distribution. There's a lot of work going on in training new agents, as well as existing agents on total needs selling. That's what drives them towards doing a total needs analysis with customers.  That ends up generally in not just an investment sale, but very often a pretty beefy protection sale and that's why you're seeing some of the numbers that we've already shown to you today.</p>
          <p>The efforts on distribution aren't limited just to agency. We're still very much focused on bank and that's doing very well also.  And there are markets where bank distribution was uniquely disrupted by what happened during the course of the third and fourth quarter of last year. We're starting to see that come back.  And we've done a lot of work in building bank assurance, particularly in China and in Taiwan, over the last several months. And that's coming through very, very strongly in the results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nick, perhaps just the U.K. distributors, and I think you and I are both yesterday's men, so perhaps Tidjane can talk about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that gives me an incredibly robust platform. I'm sure you're all dying to hear what I've got to say. I'll talk for the next 20 minutes and then I'll hand over to Michael McLintock.</p>
          <p>As far as U.K. distribution is concerned, I think we've had a very, a very strong story over the course of the last year. We've actually increased the number of our regional sales units. We had 44 new panel wins last year and we've actually had 39 new panel wins in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>I think there's a lot of good evidence that our service levels to the advisor community have improved.  And as far as our sort of fitness for the new RDR world is concerned and I think with our early move towards some factory gate pricing across a number of our products, then I think we're well placed in that new environment. Tidjane?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to stay a little longer than these two, I'm going to say a word.  No, Jon, it's also about retail and wholesale in what we've done. It's not just that we've shifted things in the distribution. It's also about diversification, the fact that we've been both a retail and a wholesale player in the two key markets, the U.S. and the U.K., has allowed us flexibility.  And you can turn the tap off much more easily on both on gigs than you could when you have a brand and a retail presence.  And we need to also support the sales force.  So I think that has given us flexibility that we've used.</p>
          <p>So back to your question on books, our appetite for books is actually healthy in normal market conditions. The point is that when you're capital constrained you have go as we've done from the highest, you fill your bucket from the highest profitability to the shortest base back down. In more favorable times, we write all the value creating business we can and in such times things like books perfectly fit into our strategy, which at this point in the cycle we made a tactical decision not to write any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Andrew Crean, Autonomous Research. A couple of questions, just on capital allocation, if there's so much pricing power that you have and the capacity to write good retail business, will you always constrain yourselves to the cash generation or will at some stage you allow yourself to write more business than the cash generated in that period will allow? And second question, this whole debate on Solvency II over liquidity premiums, if the U.K. were to lose that debate and you'd have to be bound by government bond yields, what would the capital impact to that be on you?  And do you see that you could absorb that internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tidjane, are you happy to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll take the first one. I think it's a fantastic question really, so problem of how much business to write and how much cash to generate. I think fundamentally it's about giving you visibility and confidence in what we're doing.  And that's the path we're on through the disclosures on free surplus to if you wish in a way earn the right to write more business, more profitable business as long as we're delivering what we're promising through the embedded value and the evolution of profits.</p>
          <p>So I think at this point in the cycle we'd rather stay relatively cautious and we'd rather continue to drive the cash up. But there may come a point, a period where you may not be cash positive in every single period because you see a profit is out there and if that happens then we'll explain it and show it. But for the time being, maintaining the cash flow discipline I think is useful and is a good way to bring the Group forward.</p>
          <p>Solvency II, we are supportive &#x2013; we've been supportive of a risk based, economic capital based solvency r&#xE9;gime. We think that's a good thing for the industry. Diversification benefits will be significant for us and there are other benefits. Clearly, there is a debate on the liquidity premium and it's encouraging that the CFO Forum with MCEV has moved towards recognition of a premium. There seems to be now an agreement on that and really, all I can say is that the discussions are continuing.</p>
          <p>The consequences of a lack of agreement on that point will be so wide ranging, because they would go way beyond just the capital of insurance companies. It will have very deep consequences on the functioning of the bond market itself, given the size that we have as investors. But I think that that will have to be discussed at a higher level, meaning with the government, et cetera, but at this stage, we cannot speculate on numbers. We are lobbying to get to a reasonable outcome and we have every reason to believe that, that will be the case.</p>

          <p>Hi. Greig Paterson, KBW. Three questions. One is, I just want to understand the degree to which affected AIAs who are paying double commission is creating inertia in terms of agent recruiting or are you starting to get over that hurdle? Are you starting to move across in Asia? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Second one is in terms of the U.K., would you consider selling the U.K. operation to company like resolution, and if you'd just make some comments around that? And the third one is in terms of acquisition and acquisition capital, just understanding within the context of your fixed charge cover to what extend you can issue hybrid debt? I mean, maybe you can give me a number. Can you say a billion, two, three whatever to get some idea of sort of the capacity that you have?</p>

          <p>Barry, are you happy to talk about AIA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our understanding is that the double commission payments which were occurring in certain markets &#x2013; certain AIA markets have stopped now as of the last couple of months. The focus as in terms of stabilizing distribution has focused to talking to the agents about an upcoming IPO and all the benefits that they'll get from the IPO and the manufacturer of some products that we've sort of autopsy, we can't figure out how in the world they put them together.</p>
          <p>But there is a two-pay, five-year endowment that's just come out in Hong Kong that we're scratching our heads over, looks like a negative embedded value. But in terms specifically to the double commissions, we think that has slowed down and they've shifted to other techniques to try to stabilize distribution. I think as to whether or not there are opportunities, I think there is some disruption and it will be interesting to see how quickly these agents move in and where they go, but there will no doubt be flight to quality on the part of some of them.</p>

          <p>Yes, well, U.K. I think we are very happy with our U.K. business. We find a new strategy, which Nick has implemented very successfully to focus business on two products, generating good margins. You've seen the margins increase again. We are very comfortable with our position. That's all we have to say on the topic. Acquisition capital, Tier 1, Tier 2, we have technically basically exhausted our Tier 1 capacity. We still have a lot of Tier 2 capacity. We are very far from the limit there. You are talking billions, we could issue billions more Tier 2 at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks very much. It's Blair Stewart from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Two questions on cash flow. Firstly, on the free surplus, particularly the top line, which is the expected cash flow from the value in-force, can you talk about the drivers there? I think it's up somewhere like 10, 15% year-on-year, despite the fact that this is actually dropped off, so what's going on there? And specifically, the second question is specifically on Asia with the higher profits even aligned for the one-off and cash flow coming through. Again, could you just talk a bit more detail there, given that you are selling more capital intensive protection products and the asset base has been under some pressure? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no, it's an interesting question, what happens in Asia? I am giving you this from memory, so don't quote me too precisely on that. But we basically added a billion to the embedded value from '08 to '09 and what's going on, is that you grow VIVIFA, the reserve discount rate and the net worth and investment return rate and when you do these calculations, you realize that there's even a few &#x2013; quite a good progression in the generation of the surplus.</p>
          <p>So that's really driven by the volumes of business would return and the stickiness of that business. Basically, if you go from one year to another year has allowed us to continue to progress and we don't see any reason why that would stop. If you go back to the IFRS chart that I showed on the reserve development, you see the contribution in Asia coming through. And it's feeding through the numbers really. So Asia is playing a significant role in that.</p>
          <p>And so that's where you can see that in the U.S. But the developments in Asia are very positive. Now clearly the health and protection for that are more capital intensive, but also there have forward payback periods and they come back more quickly, but that's Barry's domain.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The J-curve on the protection products. It does go deeper below the line, but when it comes out, it looks like a shuttle shot. I mean and it doesn't stay underwater very long. So we have been at this now for a couple of years, the volumes are coming through in a material way. So, you're going &#x2013; we're going to quickly get to a point where we're seeing real cash coming out of those products, I mean, material scale.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's James Pearce from Cazenove. Two questions, first, could Clark talk about the VA margin expansion and specifically the consumer behavior that you reference in the press release and talk about sustainability of the new high level of VA margins? I think the comments were about the fixed annuity margin in the presentation? Second, on free surplus in Asia, you've gone from minus 200 and some to plus 900. What are your plans to do with that money? Is that earmarked for shareholder dividends or for the U.S. or M&amp;A or what have you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On U.S. margin on VAs, you split the margin increase into roughly three pieces. One is going to be repricings that we've done. We've done &#x2013; been doing some repricings late last year, early this year. There is some more stuff teed up for this autumn. That's about a third of the increase. That's sustainable. If anything, that might get a little better as we continue to reprice stuff.</p>
          <p>Another third you can think of is coming from the allocation of the money to the fixed accounts. Allocation of new money to the fixed accounts has been running higher than historical, been running at about 30% rather than 20.  That's money that's being credited at 2%. So the margin on that is pretty good. As money shifts back to the unit-linked accounts, the net margin will start to decline.</p>
          <p>And then the other piece, policyholder behavior, late last year we reviewed policyholder behavior versus assumptions.  And our assumptions going in to this on the guarantee benefits on policyholder behavior has always been very conservative because what we said is we don't have experience in the tails and therefore we're going to be very conservative on our approach in the tails. We have experience in the tails now, lots of it, and so we were able to make some adjustments to policyholder behavior assumptions there.  That was about the other third.  As long as the policyholder behavior remains good and there's no changes there that indicate anything differently, that should hang around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On free surplus, one point about Taiwan is that it's been a fantastic transaction really that Barry and the team have developed. It puts us in a much better position. It's not always visible. But what it's done is reduced the volatility of our balance sheet and our capital position. We're in a much more comfortable position now. So it's not about giving that money back immediately. We are just in a more comfortable, more stable position, which allows us to really manage for the long-term.</p>
          <p>And again on the dividend, my view is it's difficult to have a dividend that would be both low and volatile. So we have set it at an absolute level, but it's compatible with our growth ambitions. And as I said, we intend to continue to have a progressive policy throughout the cycle, and a level where it allows us to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Colin Simpson from Goldman. Can you talk a little bit about Pru India, please? It seems the IRDA's introduced some price caps on both existing and new business. Is that going to have a material impact? And also, there seems to be some talk about a potential IPO should the FDI limits increase. What's your appetite for that sort of activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Barry can take the first one, they're both on the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The regulator has introduced some caps that could have impact on the unit-linked products. The industry right now is in discussion with IRDA in an attempt to make certain that we're talking about the fees involved in actually managing the underlying funds in these unit-linked products as opposed to the insurance charges. And hopefully we will get that all sorted out in a proper way.</p>
          <p>Obviously it's going to require us to go back on new products in particular and take another look at the pricing, make sure that we generate acceptable margins from those products. It gives us even more impetus to do, in some respects, what we were already doing, which was also shifting the focus of the India agency force from pure and transparent investment products towards health products.  And we've had a lot of success in doing that. Unit premiums are still quite a bit smaller than for the investment products, but the actual number of sales being made of health products in India is skyrocketing.</p>
          <p>And then you want me to talk about the, yeah, I mean there is lots of discussion of IPO.  There is lots of discussion of increasing foreign investor share from 26 to 49%. It seems to be a more positive environment given the election results, the political results in India. But the reality is the proposal has not come out. It's not part of the budget package for the government this year. There is speculation it could happen in the calendar first quarter. But when it happens, we will see and also, we will see when we see if it makes shareholder sense. When it happens, then we will always view it through that lens.</p>

          <p>Let me just be very clear, they're selling their brokerage unit on the unit trust side, with nothing to do with the life insurance side. So I think it's just not something that we would consider.  I mean in a sense it's a different business altogether. It was their Asset Management side, not their Life side. I think that's from this morning, Robert?</p>

          <p>But you avoided all the pitfalls that your neighbors suffered.  You've done a really great job.  You've built a great management team, and I think it gives us a lot of confidence in the company going forward.  So thanks very much and welcome to Tidjane.  And also, thanks very much to Nick for a very great restructuring he did on the U.K. side.   It's hard to see him go.</p>
