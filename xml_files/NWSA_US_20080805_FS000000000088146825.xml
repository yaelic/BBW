          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.  Welcome to the News Corp. Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Gary Ginsberg, Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs for News Corporation.  Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Mary, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2008 Year End Earnings Conference Call.  I apologize to those of you in New York for our late start today.  Joining me are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO of News; Peter Chernin, President and COO; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO.</p>
          <p>As is our custom, Dave will begin the call with a brief summary of the results, focusing on items not immediately obvious from a reading of the Earnings Release, which we assume you all now have.  Rupert will then give some deeper commentary on a couple of our international initiatives including SKY Italy (sic) [SKY Italia] and our international cable channels, and then offer some perspective on our print operations including our latest acquisition, the Dow Jones Company.</p>
          <p>Peter will then speak about what you can expect from our media and entertainment assets in fiscal 2009, including some forward commentary on our television and cable businesses, as well as an update on what's ahead at the film company.  We will then, of course, take your questions.</p>
          <p>Just some legal ease, this call is, of course, governed by the Safe Harbor Provisions.  On this call we will make some statements that constitute forward-looking statements within Private Securities Litigation Reform As compared to, of 1995.  These forward-looking statements, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in public filings with the SEC that could cause results to be materially different from those in the forward-looking statements.  Finally, please note that certain financial measures we will use in this call, EPS and net income are expressed in a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to in certain items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation will be posted on our web site on our Investor Relations Earnings Release Page.  And with all that, now, I will turn the call over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gary, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone.  As you've seen in today's Earnings Release, News Corporation once again posted very solid results with double-digit revenue, operating income and net income growth for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Let's start with our full-year first. We achieved 21% operating income growth on a total company basis and 17% growth when you factor out those items we are excluding from our guidance, namely the $126 million gain on the UK land sale and the Dow Jones operating income contribution. This 17% growth is consistent with the upper end of the expectations we provided to you six months ago and well above the low teens guidance we provided about a year ago.</p>
          <p>This strong financial performance was driven by 15% overall revenue growth and double digit earnings growth at our television, cable, DBS, and newspaper and information service segments.  Bottom-line the company reported net income of 5.4 billion versus 3.4 billion last year. The related earnings per share was $1.81, a 68% improvement over last year's reported earnings per share of $1.08.  Included in net income and earnings per share are a couple of items that I'd like to highlight.  We reported pre-tax other income of $2.3 billion, which includes a gain of approximately 1.7 billion related to the Liberty DIRECTV transaction.</p>
          <p>Gains from the disposal of our interest in the Bay Area RSN, in Gemstar as well as a positive mark-to-market adjustment on our bus liability. In addition, our equity earnings reflects a $485 million charge for our share of BSkyB's write down on its ITV investment. Excluding the net income effects of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.22 this fiscal year, an increase of 22% over similarly adjusted $1.00 in fiscal 2007.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the fourth quarter.  For the quarter, operating income of 1.48 billion was up 21% over the fourth quarter a year ago.  This improvement reflects at least double-digit growth in all of our segments, with the exception of television, which was below last year.  The quarter's results also include the $126 million gain on the United Kingdom land sale and Dow Jones operating income contributions that, if excluded, would reduce the quarter's operating income improvement to 9% over the fourth quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>Bottom-line, the company reported net income for the quarter of 1.13 billion, a 27% improvement over last year's fourth quarter results.  The related earnings per share for the quarter was $0.43 and this is a 54% improvement over last year's earnings per share of $0.28.  Excuse me.  Similar to the full-year result, the fourth quarter equity earnings included a write down on BSkyB's ITV investment, of which our share was $111 million.  Additionally, our other income in the quarter was $433 million, reflecting gains on disposal of our interest in the Bay Area RSN and Gemstar as well as mark-to-market adjustments on our Bucks liability.  Excluding the net income effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.35 this quarter, an increase of 13% over a similarly adjusted $0.31 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.</p>
          <p>And given that you all have the Earnings Release, I won't talk about all the operations.  But let me just highlight a couple. Our largest driver of earnings growth in the quarter was Filmed Entertainment which with operating income of $220 million, this is more than double the 106 million reported in the fourth quarter a year ago.  This strong includes continued worldwide DVD sales of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Juno as well as the April DVD release of Alien Versus Predator in the United States.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, we had lower releasing costs related to theatrical releases in the quarter versus a year ago and higher profit contributions at 20th Century Fox Television, reflecting lower development costs on the production of fewer pilots as a result of the writers' strike.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, we had a very strong result at SKY Italia.  SKY Italia achieved its highest quarter of profitability ever with $212 million of operating income.  This is a 37% increase from the fourth quarter a year ago.  SKY added 147,000 gross and 55,000 net subscribers in the quarter.  This is 72% more net additions compared to the fourth quarter a year ago.  This higher level of net additions is partially related to the free trial promotion offered in the third fiscal quarter this year.  For the year, SKY added 366,000 net new subscribers, increasing our year end subscriber count to just over 4.6 million subscribers.</p>
          <p>In addition, the annual churn rate remained low at approximately 10% for the fourth consecutive year.  Monthly ARPU averaged approximately 44 euros.  Euros per subscriber this year, in SAC on an annual basis, approximated 260 euros per subscriber.  And this is about even with last year's levels.</p>
          <p>At our television segment, operating income in the quarter of $279 million declined 28% as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago with lower earnings reported by the stations, the Fox Network and Star.  Station operating income decreased 26% in the quarter, primarily resulting from market &#x2013; ad sales declines averaging about 10% in our markets. The weakest ad sales categories continued to be automotive, telecommunications, and movies.</p>
          <p>Revenues and operating income were also down in the quarter at the Fox Broadcasting Network due lower ratings that more than offset higher advertising pricing.  And at Star, the cost of programming initiatives at Star Plus and at Star World, more than offset higher advertising revenues.</p>
          <p>At our cable networks, again we had very solid growth in this segment in the fourth quarter.  Our operating income contribution of $313 million was up 29 million over the fourth quarter a year ago.  This is an especially good result, considering we incurred start-up losses of about $36 million for the Big 10 and the Fox Business Channel in the quarter.  The largest year-over-year gains in the quarter were from the RSNs, which reflect higher affiliate rates from the Fox News Channel, due to higher affiliate rates, additional subscribers and advertising revenue increases. In the international channels, from advertising and affiliate increases led by our Latin American and European channels.</p>
          <p>Our newspaper and information segment also reported a good quarter with operating income of $262 million and this is up 29% over the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase largely reflects advertising and circulation revenue increases at our Australian papers, reduced costs from our UK print projects, favorable foreign exchange movements in both Australia and the United Kingdom and the inclusion of Dow Jones.</p>
          <p>In our other segment, we reported fourth quarter operating income of $69 million as compared to an operating loss of 17 million a year ago.  The current quarter includes the $126 million gain on the sale of land in the United Kingdom.  After talking about this for two years, we finally completed it in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At Fox Interactive Media, revenues in the quarter of $225 million were up 23% compared to a year ago as a result of higher search and advertising revenues.  The search component increase accounted for more than half of the overall revenue increase.  In terms of earnings contribution in the quarter of 6 million was down 24 million from a year ago levels, as revenue gains were more than offset by planned increases in development and technical costs associated with MySpace domestic and international expansion and the addition of new features.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2009.  And as we measure this guidance, we are excluding from fiscal 2008 the $253 million in operating profit contributions from businesses or assets sold in fiscal 2008, which will no longer be included in our ongoing results; namely the eight TV stations, the three RSNs sold to Liberty and the UK land sale.  So as we look at measuring operating growth in fiscal 2009, we are comparing it to a base of 5.13 billion in operating profit for fiscal 2008.  And as we look at fiscal 2009, we expect many of our businesses will generate very good year-over-year earnings growth.  And these include continued growth at SKY Italia for new subscribers and further growth in our cable networks led by a new affiliation deal at Fox News and further expansion of our international channel, improved monetization of Internet traffic at MySpace and the full year consolidation of Dow Jones.</p>
          <p>But we are also facing some challenging comparisons from certain items that positively impacted fiscal 2008 that will not repeat in fiscal 2009.  And these include the Fox Network and stations broadcast of the most watched Super Bowl this past February, reduced programming and production and pilot costs in fiscal 2008 at our TV production business and the network related to the Writer's Strike earlier this year.  And at our film division, the timing of three of our most significant tent pole theatrical releases for fiscal 2009 will be in late fourth quarter in the first days of fiscal 2010, resulting in substantially all of the marketing expenditures being absorbed in fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we also expect to be operating in a much more difficult economic environment than we did this past year.  And in particular, a significantly more challenging local advertising environment for both broadcast television and newspapers.  Taking all of these items into account and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we anticipate our operating income growth rate for fiscal 2009 to be in the 4 to 6% range above the $5.13 billion fiscal 2008 result I discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>With all of that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rupert for some further comments.  Rupert?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It will be just one moment while we reconnect his line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>If everyone would just hang on one minute, we have had some technical difficulties.  Rupert's in Beijing on a separate line.  We'll get him shortly.  I apologize.  We're going to change over.  Peter's going to go ahead and give his comments now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Why don't I go first and then we'll turn it back over to Rupert once he's re-connected.  Before I go back to Rupert, I want to touch on a few of our core businesses that continue to perform well, despite the increasing economic pressures that Dave just described.  And give a little more color on why we think that they are positioned to weather the turbulence we're all currently feeling to some degree.</p>
          <p>Let me start with Fox Broadcasting, which finished its fourth straight season as the number one network with the largest margin of victory.  And in a first for any network in the past decade, Fox ranked number one across all key demos.  We think this momentum will result in a ratings upswing as we enter the fall season in just a few weeks with a stable schedule of hits.  House returns as the number one scripted show on television for the second year in a row, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was last season's top new scripted show on any network and Moment of Truth was the number one new series on broadcast television and finally American Idol continues to dominate primetime with a 57% advantage over its closest competitor last season.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we believe we have the single most buzzed about new show...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize for that glitch everybody.  Good afternoon and thank you very much, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Rupert, hang on.  Peter is in the middle of his because we didn't have you on the line.  He'll finish his and then we'll go to you if that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward, we have the single most buzzed about new show on network television in Fringe from J.J. Abrams.  There's also tremendous excitement for the return of 24 in January so much so that we're producing a two-hour prequel TV movie for November. We had quite a strong up front this year on our network in terms of volume with solid pricing increases and thus far a low level of cancellations.  The scatter market also remains robust.  Last month's All Star game beat our goals even without the extra innings.  We're in the middle of the football up front and pacing strongly ahead of last year.  And our three big American Idol sponsors, Coke, Ford and AT&amp;T, have all already renewed for the upcoming season.  And in our top categories, spending is up across the board.</p>
          <p>While the network outlook is bright, our local stations are feeling the effects of a worsening economy.  The total local ad market was down 10% in the fourth quarter and pacings for Q1 '09 continue to be weak.  We're starting to see some presidential political spending in several markets but spending in key categories like automotive and telecom and financial services remains down.  While we continue to generate a growing market share of the ad markets, we actually had record market share in July, the overall local ad market is highly challenged at the moment.</p>
          <p>Moving back to a bright front, moving back to cable, we're seeing significant growth on a number of fronts, especially internationally.  Last year Fox International channels launched 40 new channels and generated revenues close to $1 billion, with margins of 25%, among the highest in the international cable industry.  Notably, almost all of the revenue comes from either emerging markets or mature markets with low but growing cable and satellite penetration.  So our revenue potential still has great upside.  In the past quarter, ad sales for Fox International channels continued to show robust growth, up 30% and pacings for Q1 '09 also look strong.</p>
          <p>Domestically we also had a very strong cable entertainment upfront this year, with FX and Nat Geo both up over 20%.  On the news side, Fox News had a solid upfront as well, with strong spending gains across a number of categories, like consumer products and pharmaceuticals.  Additionally, our new Fox News affiliate deal with Time Warner, which begins later this month, was done at a significantly higher subscriber rate over the previous agreement.  And we're in negotiations with EchoStar and Comcast which we hope to complete by the end of the year for similar rates.</p>
          <p>On the film side, we had record operating profit for the seventh consecutive year, which I think is quite a good feat in this industry.  And the outlook over the next several years and beyond is very healthy.  In fact, over the next year and a half, I think we have the strongest tent pole lineup we've had in many years.  Starting in November with Baz Luhrmann's Australia, followed in December by The Day the Earth Stood Still and Marley and Me, based on the best-selling book.  Then late next spring we have two highly anticipated sequels I think will do strong business.  X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Night at the Museum 2 and then the summer will kick off with Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, the third in the very successful Ice Age franchise.</p>
          <p>Beyond expected big box office grosses, we also do very strong DVD business.  And speaking of DVDs, I think it's worth noting that despite the recent hand wringing over the health of the DVD business, the retail space for the entire DVD market has actually widened by an estimated 5% over the last 12 months.  And the Blu-ray format is already ahead of DVD comparatively in terms of adoption at this point in its life cycle, with sales of more than $200 million year-to-date through June, up about 300% for the same period in '07.</p>
          <p>Finally, turning to FIM, we're actually quite pleased with the momentum at MySpace.  Revenues are up both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and in May MySpace hit at an all-time high with nearly 74 million uniques in the US for the month. Today, just over a month into our new fiscal year, we're very encouraged with what we're seeing.  We're pacing well against internal expectations.  User engagement continues to grow and our recent redesign effort is being positively received by both users and advertisers alike.  Right now, we feel good about where things are headed.</p>
          <p>We're seeing dramatic increases in branded display advertising across a number of categories for the first month of Q1 '09, including financial services were up over 100% year-over-year.  Consumer package goods up over 150% year-over-year and food and beverage actually up over 170% year-over-year.  Overall pacings for all Q1 branded display are very strong and are exceeding those of a year ago by double digits.</p>
          <p>Our hyper targeting initiative, which was written up in the papers this week, continues to gain traction with 50% of all orders now including some form of hyper targeting.  We've seen two straight quarters of hyper targeted CPMs exceeding non-hyper targeted CPMS more than two fold.  General Motors Co., Coke, Wells Fargo, Red Bull and New Balance were among the major advertisers which included hyper targeting in their campaigns in Q4.</p>
          <p>One thing in particular I'd like to point out is that advertisers are increasingly turning to MySpace home page takeovers as a way to reach a mass audience.  Up to 40 million people visit the homepage every single day.  That's more people than watched the finale of American Idol, and the average user is spending more time on the homepage, up 54% during the week of July 22 versus the same week last year.  It's a very powerful promotional tool and we're seeing more big brands incorporate it into their marketing campaigns.  And to give you just one specific of the massive scale of the MySpace homepage, Warner Brothers did a homepage takeover for Batman Dark Knight and had over 70 million streams of the trailer with a remarkable 27% of those users viewing the trailer in its entirety.</p>
          <p>And finally, next month we'll launch the highly anticipated MySpace music joint venture, offering users the ability to listen to free streaming music, purchase song downloads, ring tones, t-shirts and concert tickets.  And with 65% of our user base already embedding music on their profiles we see great potential for this business.  So despite overall concerns about the economy and serious issues with our local television station business, we feel our core businesses are all well positioned for expansion in fiscal '09.  And with that let me turn it back to Rupert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter and Dave.  Good afternoon everyone.  I'm sorry for that telephone glitch.  And I'm sorry for the lateness of the call but I'm joining you my New York colleagues from Beijing.  If I sound a little distant you'll know why.  New Corporation is a global company and I've spent the past few days with our team in India which is building a remarkably successful and very profitable television and multimedia operation.  With all the talk of international downturn even the gloomy Indian economist are still forecasting GDP growth in the coming year of at least 7%.</p>
          <p>As Dave just outlined, fiscal 2008 was a very good year operationally and financially.  We finally completed our tax-free asset swap with Liberty Media breaking out in a nearly 1.7 billion gain on our divestiture of DIRECTV while at the same time reducing our outstanding share count by 16%. We also completed our acquisition of Dow Jones with its information services businesses and the Wall Street Journal. Include arguably the most important and vibrant brands in business news worldwide.</p>
          <p>We also raised over $1.5 billion in capital by selling a non-strategic ownership position at Gemstar-TV Guide and minority interest in other cable assets, as David already mentioned.  And in July since the end of the year, we've just received $1.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of eight smaller television stations.  The financial success we've enjoyed should come as no surprise.  It's a steady continuation of the growth we've sustained really since 2002.  In fact, over the last five years using almost any metric few if any companies in our sector have matched our revenue, operating income or earnings per share growth &#x2013; revenue growth of almost 14% a year on average with average operating income growth of 18% and earnings per share from continuing operations up 30% per year on average. As we look at the year ahead, we anticipate an increasingly difficult economic environment.  The escalating price of energy, the contraction of real estate values and liquidity and confidence issues in the finance sector are creating economic shocks that will likely be felt by the vast majority of consumers in the US as well as in Europe.</p>
          <p>However, and maybe elsewhere. However, even in this recessionary environment we believe we have the unique growth -- in our drivers to go forward, and balance sheet strength, not only to weather the storm but to strengthen and grow our businesses. As David indicated a few minutes ago, we have considerable financial challenges in our local television businesses.  I believe we can still maintain structural growth at several of our younger businesses that are coming to fruition, particularly at SKY Italia, several of our cable businesses and at Fox Interactive. Our strategy of investing and developing businesses albeit at a cost to short-term earnings not only differentiates us from our peers but delivers more consistent long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Over the last four years, SKY Italia has grown in annual operating profit by almost $700 million in aggregate, transitioning from a 277 million loss in fiscal 2004 to about 420 million profit this last year. This growth was generated by the audience of 1.9 million net new subscribers over the period, achieving total subscriptions of close to 4.6 million.  As we look ahead, we fully expect this growth should continue.</p>
          <p>The television market <mark type="inaudible" /> is one of Europe's largest with about 22 million television households with paid TV penetration in that country is barely topping 20%.  This compares to paid TV penetration of over 55% in Britain, 45% in Spain, 32% in France.  Clearly, there are at least several more years of robust growth to be captured in Italy.  Similarly over the last four years our cable programming businesses have added over 780 million in additional annual operating profits.  And that is inclusive of over 200 million spent on launching the Big 10 and Fox Business networks this last year. The popularity of the Fox News channel, the rapid expansion of our international Fox and National Geographic channels and the solidifying of our regional sports networks with longer-term affiliate carriers deals, and long-term sports rights contracts have all contributed to cable's success and strong competitive standings.</p>
          <p>Our print operations are far more than just newspapers, and so they're experiencing rapid digital growth. In the six months to the end of June, the audience at wsj.com, the Wall Street Journal's online operation rose 87.9% compared to the same period last year, and we're just getting started. In fact in July, it was over 100% increase. The Sun and The Times in London, for example, are aligned in the past with our online brands and their revenues along with those generated by subscriptions at Dow Jones, where we are finding admirable elasticity are an increasing share of our information services segment.</p>
          <p>Our Australian titles are in extremely good shape and operating in an economic climate which seems to be quite different from that in the US. All of our newspapers have a complimentary commercial strategy, exploiting the display space of print and re-purposing content for the web, so the inventory can be resold.</p>
          <p>But that the newspaper sector is changing is clear.  The companies willing to invest in new forms of delivery which have a commitment to quality will prosper.  Dow Jones is now developing a web based delivery platform that will allow us to target customers far beyond the traditional institutional clients and to extend our reach around the world in partnership with Star, SKY and MySpace.  We are fortunate to have an internal network that allows us to launch products across borders and across platforms.</p>
          <p>And we have a thriving index business.  Earlier today in Bombay I christened two new indexes.  The Global Dow which includes established and emerging companies from around the world and a new index tracking 30 prominent Indian companies and reflecting the world's changing corporate landscape. I returned to Beijing from India even more convinced that our faith in Asia's potential and that of its people will be rewarded many, many times over.</p>
          <p>News Corp.'s world resource, sorry, News Corp.'s varied resources of revenue and our global reach certainly give us a clear comparative advantage. We have a genuine momentum which will carry us through into the next year and well beyond. My time in India made me realize how much more potential there is for the corporation among our business units, which are as aggressive as they are innovative.  Other companies may indeed be struggling, but our confidence and our ambition are buttressed by our very healthy balance sheet.  So thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thanks.  Can you give us a sense of how big enterprise media now is within your newspaper segment, particularly within Dow Jones and what the growth profile of that business looks like? I think, you know, very often everyone just lumps your entire newspaper business as a newspaper business, and are missing the growth profile of that enterprise business.  Just wondering how significant the earnings contribution now is within that overall newspaper segment, and what its profile over the next few years could be?</p>
          <p>And then second, Dave made some comments about the difficulties in the advertising environment for both newspapers and TV.  You sold TV stations at 10 times EBITDA earlier this month.  Wondering what your thought process is to shedding other assets, given the attractive valuation you were able to exit TV stations at recently.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could just pick that up certainly on the Dow Jones side. I know that more than half of the profits already come from various digital efforts there &#x2013; our digital delivered products such as the news wires, the Factiva, the index business and so on.  All of these things are growing very fast.  We see Dow Jones as being right at the forefront, of the sort of the digital revolution.  For instance, the just -- the very basic thing at wsj.com is expanding extremely fast.  It leads into the subscription service at which we have now well over 1.1 million subscribers at a healthy price.  And one that can be increased and will be increased and that, of course, leads into very specialized wires at which we charge very high premiums.  It is an information service not a newspaper, an information service, which will be neutral to all platforms, whether it comes on Kindle or a mobile telephone, or a PC or whatever. That really goes for all our newspapers. Our newspapers should be seen as services to their publics and their communities but will be available in every way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the second part of your question which was just about television stations and would we sell any more of those businesses in this environment. Look, first of all, I'm not sure. I think we sort of timed that sale pretty perfectly and felt good about the multiples that we got for it.   Secondly, I think that it's important to point out, we've got a pretty good group of television stations right now, including I believe, nine duopolies in major markets.  So a big chunk of our television station inventory is now tied up in duopolies which continue to outperform the market.  So, while I guess we'd would probably be open to discussing anything, I'm not sure I'd be looking for us to see us selling some additional televisions stations in the short term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Can you talk about the leverage of them?  It sounds like; pretty much a guaranteed double-digit revenue growth between branded pacings and this step up in search.  So I was just wondering if you could talk about what your cost outlook is for fiscal '09 and talk about your strategy there, in terms of, potentially getting bigger or gaining scale?</p>
          <p>And secondly, local advertising clearly weak for everyone, but national still seems to be strong, and Peter you've been quoted all over saying there's a tale of two worlds, today.  Are you not seeing any spill over like in any key categories like auto into national?  And Dave said, 46% OI growth, what is your revenue guidance for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on the FIM side, the key thing that I'd say, Jessica, is, certainly, we believe that we are still in a scale gain business.  And it's very, very, competitive environment.  And it's important that we keep growing and we keep investing to grow.  Investing to grow in terms of development, in terms of technology, in terms of international, in terms of new features, in terms of content that we will continue to do so.  That being said, our expectation is that we can grow our margins in the FIM business in fiscal '09.  So while our costs will continue to grow.  And we're expecting right now, I think, our projections are we're going to have revenue growth of 30%.  Our costs will continue to grow but we expect the margins to grow also so that we will outpace our cost growth with revenue.   We will certainly continue to focus on growing the overall category and to making the right kind of investments.</p>
          <p>And frankly, I'm pretty proud of what they've achieved over the last six months.   I think the home page redesign, the new app products, the work they've done on hyper targeting, the work they've done on optimization, all of those have been investments that I think have been very worthwhile investments and have really grown the overall business.</p>
          <p>In terms of the national versus local advertising business, we are seeing real strength in national, and particularly, in some of the cable upfronts but also on our broadcast network business. In terms of key categories, certainly the auto category is probably the one that is one of the weaker.  But we have a couple of key advantages.  One is that, the biggest, our single biggest advertiser, is Ford, and they chose to renew their advertising on American Idol, which is their biggest chunk of things. So that was, is significant to us.  We have also made multi-year sports deals with a number of the car advertisers.  So we have locked in two years, sometimes even three year deals, particularly with the Big Three.  So those deals have been locked in the last year so that I think gives us a little bit of extra strength.</p>
          <p>One of the other things we're seeing is that the car companies, even as they're cutting back, at least for us, they continue to emphasize national advertising.  Because what they find is -- we've had some pretty interesting conversations with them.  And as their potential buyers go into a showroom, they have done significant work on the Internet and they know what cars they want to buy.  But that they need to do national television advertising in order to get them to look at that brand on the Internet.  So they will go on the Internet, look at two or three key brands, and choose between that.  But they are doing that branding work on national advertising.  So while it's certainly not as robust as it was two or three years ago, we've been seeing the national auto advertising hold up much stronger than the local auto advertising category.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jessica, I can't give you just one number.  But I would say, broadly, with the exception of our TV stations, which I would say probably down mid single digits, the rest of the business is likely to grow, not including obviously Fox Interactive, low to mid single digits.  Roughly is what we're planning for.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that.  So you indicated that the cable set up losses were 200 million in fiscal year '08 I think.  So I'm just curious what the fiscal '09 number? And I think that I missed it but you just said that revenue guidance of low single digits for fiscal '09? Is that right, Dave?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I said was that it's difficult to give a number, but you really got to look at it by business by business.  I say broadly we would expect our TV stations to be down mid-single digits, and the rest of the business to grow low to mid single digits, excluding the Fox Interactive business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question on that, Dave, is to the extent that you have an advertising assumption underlying your guidance, is that advertising assumption based on your current pacings?  Or are you assuming a deterioration or an improvement in your ad market throughout the year?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the cable channel.  The cable channel investment number, the losses were probably a little bit closer to about 160 or so, and we would expect those to come down probably by about 40% in fiscal '09 and continued investment in Fox Business and a real turnaround in the Big 10.</p>

We have cartel office approval.  I think we have perhaps 30%; we're just really looking at that to be perfectly honest with you.  We think it may be a big opportunity.  We have now about two senior directors on the Board, plus an independent; that's out of six directors.  We're working very well with the management.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I just have two.  First, on SKY Italia, Rupert, if you could talk about the long-term expectations you have there for penetration growth.  If you look at what SKY did in Britain, sort of changed the strategy a few years ago to become a little bit more aggressive at the lower end.  Get involved, buy Easy Net and use broadband and phone to drive additional penetration.  As you look at the Italian market, are there additional products that you would like to sell along side SKY to help re-accelerate or drive further penetration? Or do you feel like the business is set up to get where you would like it to get under the existing structure?</p>
          <p>And then if I could just ask a question on MySpace, the usage numbers obviously are impressive.  The targetability, we all understand.  Has the economic environment, and this is for Peter or Rupert, made it more difficult to get advertisers on board with the targeting technology?  Or is that sort of irrelevant given the early-stage of this business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just taking the first half of your question about SKY Italia.  We see several more years of this, sort of, level of growth.  It's very popular.  It's doing well.  It's got a great name there.  There's no reason why it shouldn't.  Now we are cooperating with broadband suppliers, and helping them and they help us, rather than buy into it in a big way as we did in Britain.  We don't think it will be necessary in Italy.  And we don't intend to make that sort of commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the MySpace piece, what I would say is look, I think anecdotally probably that market is a little bit weaker.  But we're in a pretty nascent stage so I think we're seeing pretty strong demand for the targeting technology because it's new enough.  And to be honest, you know, I think as we announced we made a change in ad sales management five or six months ago.  And we think that we're reaping the benefits of a new aggressive focus there.  So while the market may be a little bit soft, I think our experience in that market certainly over the first month of this fiscal year.  We're encouraged by what were seeing out there right now for ourselves.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  On the international cable channels &#x2013; networks, it sounds like you did about 250 million in operating profit against I think it was about 180 million that you were targeting at the beginning of the year.  Can you talk about I guess how much of that growth is organic versus consolidation?  I think in part of National Geographic?  And then also, can you give us some more specifics about if it's specific channels that are being taken up in different markets, specific programming?  And I know you talked about Latin America, but I guess just more specifics on both the content and the markets to help us understand where the opportunity is and where the risk could be?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't remember what we projected, but I think your numbers are fairly accurate.  Of that total number, probably about $80 million represents Nat Geo-consolidation so the rest of it is organic growth.  What I think we've done, and we talked about this a little bit maybe two calls ago, is that we've done a pretty good job of creating a sort of modular model where we have certain channel brands, whether it's Nat Geo, whether it's Fox Life, whether it's Fox Crime, whether it's Nat Geo Wild et cetera and we're able to sort of open up new channels and markets for relatively little money.  We can in a lot of these markets launch a channel for three, $4 million, reach break-even within eight or 10 quarters.</p>
          <p>And so one of the things I said earlier was that we launched 40 new channels last year, that's almost a new channel a week.  And in all sorts of territories ranging from &#x2013; just in the last week or so we just launched Fox in Germany which is a big event for us, but we also launched small channels during the year in places like Serbia and small places in Eastern Europe.  We are seeing pretty good growth across lots of these developing markets, across Latin America, across Eastern Europe and also the maturation of some of our channels in bigger markets.  Italy continues to be very, very strong for us, we seem to be delivering the bulk of the ratings or the single biggest content driver on SKY Italia. The UK continues to be strong for us.  Our Asian markets continue to be strong.  So it really is a mix of all these things. And I'm sorry I just wanted to clarify, that 80 million Nat Geo number was actually the total global number, of that 50 million is international and $30 million was Nat Geo domestic.  So of the number $50 million, of the international number $50 million was the Nat Geo consolidation, not 80.  I apologize.  80 is the total number.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Just one question for Peter.  It's clear that the viewer ship of both professional and user generated video content is growing really quickly on the web and you see that with your own usage numbers, on MySpace and you see that on YouTube, the question is that growth of mind share on sites like the MySpace and YouTube, is that a fragmentation risk that could impact viewer ship of TV network and stations in a secular way?  And if not, I imagine your answer would be no, but even if that's true, even if the Internet is additive to the total, do you think that the web could add incrementally to overall media consumption but at the same time be cannibalistic to revenue at some of the more traditional ways of distribution like the TV network, the TV stations or even DVD sales?  And given News Corp's content ownership on both sides of that equation, old media and new media, I hope you can comment.  Thanks for taking the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I guess I would say on an absolute level probably the use of user generated content is competitive.  It's eyeballs going someplace but that's the world in which we live, we live in the world of infinite choice and people are going to have plenty of opportunities to watch whatever they want.  And our job as programmers on our traditional business is to make sure that our programming is so compelling that people would rather watch it than all of them there. If they're not going to watch user-generated content, they're going to play video games or they're going to surf the web for other things, or they're going to look at their cell phones. So I don't want to pretend it doesn't exist, but it's just one more competitive drop in the bucket.  I think a couple of things I want to say.</p>
          <p>First of all, I believe that we need to look at user-generated content very differently than we're looking at premium content on the Web and we have the number two user-generated content on the web on MySpace and one of the things, just as an aside that I'd like to say, is we're working very aggressively to offer advertisers segregation opportunities so that advertisers &#x2013; one of the things is they can be segregated from content they may not want to appear next to while at the same time those advertisers who are interested in that traffic, we can guarantee them that maximum traffic.</p>
          <p>On the premium side, you know one of the things we feel really good about is the growth of Hulu.  We are now a top 10 site; we're seeing 3 million weekly uniques and some pretty large streaming numbers.  I think the New York Times reported that we had 88 million streams in the month of June and I think that that's actually a good example of the way we are trying to effectively transition this business.  So if we look at Hulu, I don't necessarily look at Hulu as competitive with the broadcast network, but I look at it as I look at it as an opportunity for us to replace something which had gone away, which is broadcast reruns.  We used to, 10 years ago, make a lot of money running reruns of our shows, those reruns, we don't run any reruns at all of our reality shows, of our serialized dramas, we run some reruns of our self-contained dramas.  But what Hulu's done is basically allowed us to replace that rerun revenue which had gone away.  And so we see the growth of something like that, we're being very careful to make that additive.</p>
          <p>The same thing is if you look at things like electronic sell-through on both the movie side and the TV side, we work very carefully to make sure those electronic sell-through deals had margins that were equal to if not better than the DVD business.  So we feel good about it.  The whole business migrated there, we'd feel fine about it because our margins are the same and if you look at video on demand that's actually a place where our margins are stronger.  We would rather see people consume product on video on demand than we would on video rental because it's a stronger margin for us.  So look, I think we will live in a world in which you will see these transitions from so-called traditional media to various digital iterations of those media but we work very hard as a company and as an industry to make sure that we don't sacrifice and cannibalize margin in that transition.</p>

We thought we would try and monetize that while it was at its top.  We don't quite know yet whether we scale back a bit in Poland which has proven more difficult than we expected, or whether we can sell that.  But basically it could be for diversion of those resources elsewhere.  The sale of Russia is a different matter altogether.  We have great growing business there but just the &#x2013; this is purely me, I'm sorry, the more I read about investments in Russia, the less I like the feel of it.  And the more successful we'd be the more vulnerable we'd be to have it stolen from us, so better we sell now.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much.  Guys, just to follow-up on a previous question, you guys have said that you'd approach the buyback issue opportunistically, but you're levered right now at about one times debt to EBITDA, your stock is trading somewhere in kind of the six times range and the growth of the company actually looks, especially in light of the challenging environment, pretty impressive so I guess the question is with that kind of dry powder, this low a stock price and such a favorable outlook for the company, what kind of better opportunity could there be?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know why don't you buy more stock?  We've seen other companies go into heavy, heavy debt to buy back stock and it's done nothing for them.  All they've got themselves is several years ahead of them sweating to pay the debt off.  So we want to just hang loose for a little while yet.  We're not saying we're not going to buy back stock, we may well do so but right now, we're not in the business of liquidating the company by buying back stock.  We've done a big &#x2013; we've just had the biggest buyback in history in selling DIRECT for stock.  So let's just take it step by step.  There are too many uncertainties out there at this moment.</p>

          <p>We continue to look at it on a case-by-case basis.  We find that for certain kinds of movies it seems fine, for other kinds of movies we still have some concerns that it may cannibalize our DVD business.  We're continuing to do more tests and we certainly don't feel in any rush, again it sort of relates to my earlier answer which is what's paramount in our mind is protecting our overall margins and we certainly don't want to be overly aggressive until we're sure that any move like that is going to be margin accretive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Rupert, you've talked about launching new channels in India backed by 100 million in funding.  How much of that is for launching new channels?  And how much of that has been earmarked for investments in or partnerships with existing channels in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's entirely in new channels and it's probably a slightly exaggerated figure, it will be closer to 60 than to 100.  It's really just extending our existing channels into different languages and in some cases, more localized programming as you go from area to area within India.  The growth there is really extraordinary and we will be doing more and more there and we would like to be doing more in China.</p>

          <p>No.  In fact, we're looking at a couple of small divestments at the moment, which would probably pay for anything like that. But we'll be opportunistic if things turn up that can't be resisted, but we don't see very much at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks.  I wanted to ask if you could elaborate a little more on whether you're seeing signs that the local advertising weakness you've talked about in broadcast TV and in newspapers is affecting cable advertising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer that.  Look, first of all, we honestly wouldn't know with one exception, which is we sell our cable advertising on a national basis and that's quite strong.  The one area where it does affect us and it's pretty significant is through our regional sports channels.  We're a big seller of local advertising and that business, while it has some unevenness, is actually quite strong and has been holding up quite well.  I think a lot of that is a function of the overall strength of sports.  We've also worked hard to integrate a number of sponsorship deals as opposed to straight advertising deals.  So our revenues in that business, which is a pretty sizable exposure to the local cable market, have been quite solid and are holding up quite well.  The other part of the local cable business, you'd have to ask the local cable MSOs and their interconnects and we don't participate in that business so you'd have to ask them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But in terms of the national cable ad market, you're not seeing weakness there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  The national cable market we're seeing quite good strength.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about whether you're thinking or talking to any partners in the Internet space, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, any of those guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We're not talking to anyone right now.  I think that we said fairly consistently that we were willing to look at those things opportunistically and if there were something that made sense to us, we were willing to have a conversation.  But hopefully as you can tell from our previous answers, we certainly never felt like we had a defensive issue with things, that we were somehow handicapped.  We actually feel quite good about our progress across multiple fronts in that business and feel strong about our position.  So we were happy to have opportunistic conversations but they obviously went nowhere and we're not talking to anybody right now.</p>
