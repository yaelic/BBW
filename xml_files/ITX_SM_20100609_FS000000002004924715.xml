          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Presentation of Inditex results for the Interim Three Months of 2010. This presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO. The presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session comprising of two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the phone and the second part to the question received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim three months of 2010. I am Pablo Isla and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for the first quarter 2010 show that Inditex continues its ongoing international multiconcept growth. Sales have increased 14%. Over the quarter our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control. We have also maintained our strict focus on cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion our store opening plan for the year is on track. I would like to point out that following Zara's recent launch in India, Inditex is now present in 77 countries demonstrating the global reach of our business model.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010 all declines of the profit and loss account show significant growth as a result of our operating performance and the comparable base. In this context Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;2.7 billion, EBITDA of &#x20AC;560 million, a net income of &#x20AC;301 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth profit this line has increased 20% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, resulting in 59.9% gross margin. The increase is due to our inventory management, the use of sourcing proximity to response to sale growth and a positive currency impact. Operating expenses have grown 11%, reflecting mainly the growth in space and include all the start-up cost for new openings.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the trends shown at fiscal year end 2009. The position at the end of the first quarter of 2010 reflects the use of sourcing proximity with short lead times to response to sales growth. Inditex continues to show a strong financial condition.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez who will elaborate on the performance on Inditex Concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the space addition, we are on track as we have opened 98 net stores in the first quarter 2010 to reach a total of 4,705. Continuing with our international expansion we have opened stores in 29 markets over the period.</p>
          <p>Regarding the performance by format in the interim three months of 2010, Zara and the younger Concepts group together have performed broadly in line with each other with some minor differences.</p>
          <p>Regarding the younger Concepts Zara Home and Oysho have performed above the average and Stradivarius and Pull &amp; Bear below the average. The changes versus last year relate mainly to the comparable base.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the expansion for the current year 95% of total new space will be open in international markets. We plan to invest around &#x20AC;570 million over the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the outlook for the rest of the first half, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1 of February to the 7 of June 2010 have grown 13%.</p>
          <p>As we announced to you last March I would now like to provide you with the highlights regarding Zara online sales. Our teams have been working to ensure a successful launch and we feel encouraged by the opportunity to take Zara into e-commerce.</p>
          <p>On the 2 of September we will begin Zara online sales in six markets, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK. After the initial launch we have plans to rollout Zara online sales in other selected markets until we reach a global presence.</p>
          <p>Zara's offer will also be available in mobile commerce. The applications for smartphones and tablets are already in place, and have been receiving huge interest in recent months. More than two million people in 85 countries have already downloaded Zara's smartphone application. We have also witnessed significant coverage in social media. As an example 2.7 million people have joined Zara's page in Facebook.</p>
          <p>Zara's online offer will include our full product range. The offer available at our stores will be entirely available online. Regarding the logistics product will be shipped from a central inventory position in our existing distribution center in line with the business model of Zara.</p>
          <p>Our target for the launch will be to replicate the customer experience of our Zara stores, the seamless execution of the online operation and to build the platform for our global presence.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex Concepts over the quarter and some selected store openings of recent months. Inditex expansion has reached a new milestone with the launch of the first Zara store in India in May. Zara at Select CityWalk in Delhi has 1,800 square meters of retail surface. The reception has been very strong. A Zara store at Palladium mall in Mumbai will open tomorrow. Two additional Zara stores will follow in Delhi soon. We plan to rollout more locations in the country's larger cities in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Zara's arrival in India, the world's second most populous country with 1.1 billion inhabitants represents a new strategic milestone for our Group. Inditex is now present in all the key Asia markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years. Inditex expansion is currently taking place through our multiconcept approach in the majority of these markets.</p>
          <p>Massimo Dutti has opened two very relevant stores in China and France. Massimo Dutti at Shanghai's West Nanjing Road is the Concepts flagship in the Chinese market. Additionally, it has opened another prominent store in Paris at Champs Elysees.</p>
          <p>Pull &amp; Bear has opened two flagships stores in China and the United Kingdom. The stores at Shanghai's Sky Mall and London's Oxford Street showcase Pull &amp; Bear's latest collections.</p>
          <p>Regarding Bershka, I would like to highlight two remarkable openings in China and Russia. The stores at Hong Kong's Maritime Square and Moscow's Manezh Mall reflect the strong presence of the concept in these two markets.</p>
          <p>Stradivarius' new look has now been rolled-out to the majority of its stores. The openings in Shanghai's Yu Fashion Mall and Paris Rue de Rivoli show this new image.</p>
          <p>Oysho has a new store look. The store in Barcelona's Passeig de Gr&#xE0;cia carries this new image which will be rolled out in all the newer stores.</p>
          <p>Zara Home has also a new store look. The stores in Moscow's Europark and Paris, La Defense carry this new image which will also be rolled out in all the newer stores.</p>
          <p>Our accessories format Uterq&#xFC;e has opened in two new markets Russia and Mexico with the stores at Metropolis shopping mall in Moscow and at Antara Polanco <mark type="inaudible" /> Mexico. Uterq&#xFC;e is now operating 64 stores in 13 countries.</p>
          <p>Zara continues to roll out its eco-efficient store model. The new Zara store at Puerta del Angel Barcelona includes a number of features which result in a 30% reduction in energy consumption versus a standard Zara stores.</p>
          <p>Zara has opened a flexible store at Kuznetsky Most in Moscow City Center increasing further our significant presence in the capital.</p>
          <p>Zara has opened a store in Chicago's Magnificent Mile. It is the biggest Zara store in the U.S. and is located in the highly prominent building at the crossing of Michigan Avenue at Huron Street. This is the third store of Zara in Chicago.</p>
          <p>We have opened a store in Nagoya's biggest shopping mall at Mozo Wonder City. This is our 53rd store in Japan and the second in Nagoya.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to expand our business in China with highly prominent stores. Zara has opened in the heart of Shanghai's pedestrian area at East Nanjing Road. This flagship store has 1,500 square meters of retail space over two floor. This is our store number 10 in Shanghai, the host city of the World Expo 2010.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased now to answer any questions you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Richard Chamberlain from BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning guys. Richard Chamberlain from BofA Merrill Lynch. Well done on the good quarter. I just want to kick-off with an obvious question on the Spain consumer outlook. It sounds like there a lot of public sector workers were on strike yesterday, household cash flow maybe coming under pressure over the next year or two. So the question is what consumer trends are you seeing right now in Spain and how are you planning to respond to those new austerity measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well as you know when we have our quarter results presentation, we prefer not to elaborate very much on the different markets. What I would say, having in mind your question is that what I would like to tell you is that reality in Spain is better than the perception you may have. And if I think personally, I personally have a strong confidence in the dynamism of the Spanish economy going forward. So this is what I would comment to you.</p>
          <p>About the evolution of sales in different markets we prefer not to elaborate very much on our quarterly results presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, what sort of trends are you seeing in Spain at the moment, are consumers trading down, trading up and trading down, are you still taking more share from independent stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing really different from what we anticipated to you in the full year results presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's in line with last year? Yeah. Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Hi. Question really on currency, within the quarter, I just wanted to understand the currency contribution to both the revenue growth and the gross margin change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the revenue growth, you could assume around 150 basis points, currency impact. And regarding the gross margin in the full year result presentation, we were anticipating a slightly positive currency contribution in the first half and a slightly negative currency contribution in the second half of the year. This is what we were anticipating and this is what is &#x2013; been the case. We were talking about three &#x2013; regarding the gross margin increase three main drivers during the presentation and you could assume that &#x2013; what is coming from these three main drivers is similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just of the first of those drivers, you talked about inventory management. Could you be more specific about what that involved? I assume that's not simply lower markdown year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, Richard. It's not markdown because as you know the first quarter is not significantly marked by discounts. So it's basically running better all the aspects regarding the supply chain product etcetera, etcetera. On top of that you have a very intense use of the proximity sourcing to respond to high demand in a number of high turning product. And the third impact, which is the three of them are broadly similar, is a positive currency impact versus a negative one in the first quarter 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And has &#x2013; this change in inventory management, does that change your view of gross margin guidance for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you talked about to a flat plus or minus 50 bps, so is this is structural movement up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Regarding the full year, well, this is just a first quarter results presentation and as we always say we work for the stability of the gross margin having in mind that 50 basis points above or below this means a stable gross margin and we are not changing our statement when we publish the full year results presentation about the stability of the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Frank Walding from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yeah, guys. I just wanted to ask on like-for-like store costs. The sort of underlying store costs appear to have increased in the quarter. I just wanted to know what have sort of driven into that increasing cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main driver of course growth is the space growth. Of course, then you have currency impact also regarding cost you know from previous presentations it's more or less half of the impact on sales. So you could assume around 80 basis points of currency impact. And then you &#x2013; as far as we have some costs related to the evolution of sales, variable costs being also the very good evolution of sales has an impact on costs. Overall, cost growth is three points below a space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And looking forward, looking about the full year we continue targeting cost growth in line with the space growth for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was great. Thank you very much. And then just in terms of the performance of your new stores in the quarter. Is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms are these performing better than you've seen historically in terms of your new space additions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, very much in line with what had been the case in previous years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wonder if you could give us a bit more details on how the internet commercial policy is going to work, whether consumers are going to pay for delivery, whether they're going to have free pick up option in store. And attached to that, looking at the very significant numbers that you reported two million people in 85 countries downloading the mobile application, I was wondering, what is your capability to manage internet orders and would you be prepared to manage a very significant spike in orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well regarding the commercial policy, I would say that we prefer to wait until September 2 now because these type of commercial policies we prefer not to announce so much in advance our commercial policies. What I can tell you is that of course our approach will be a multichannel approach. We are not considering internet as something completely separated from the other, our main distribution channel, which are the stores. But I would prefer not to elaborate much more on that because while these are commercial secrets, I would say.</p>
          <p>And then about how able could we be regarding a potential spike on sales through internet, what I would say is that, we are not particularly concerned about that. We are beginning in six different countries. Our idea is to progressively expand our internet presence to many other countries and during next year, we should be able to represent in the most relevant countries for Internet sales in the world. And we are not particularly concerned about the possibility of managing any level of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>The following question comes from Marta Llano from Fidentiis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. It's a question on the gross margin; one of the elements that you have highlighted as a driver which is sourcing in proximity. Could it be fair to assume that the contribution of this sourcing in proximity should be enhanced in the second quarter of the year as most of your sourcing for the Spring/Summer collection should be in proximity as we approach the end of the completion of the collection? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Marta as you know sourcing in proximity is a key feature of our business model and obviously in the first quarter we have used sourcing in proximity to respond to high turning items and we will keep on using sourcing in proximity as it remains a fundamental part of our business model. But our approach is always try to react what we're seeing <mark type="inaudible" /> not to anticipate things. But again the sourcing in proximity and the flexibility of the business model we believe they have been relevant and will remain very relevant in our future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from John Belly from FG. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could you just tell me a little bit on the sales in the Q1, year-to-date, in terms of what the space contribution was in Q1 and year-to-date and maybe what total sales are up in year-to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay John what we have mentioned is that sales in local currencies from the 1 of February to the 2 of June are growing by 13%. That space growth is on track and you know that in a quarter is not the right period to breakdown the different effects in terms of space or like-for-like; we will wait for the end of the first half. But as you see the growth in the first quarter and the growth we have as of today is very, very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So I mean would there be much difference between that the 14 or 13% to giving between year-to-date and Q1 if you gave total sales now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. No significant difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but you can't say what the space contribution was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose the space contribution one quarter because we provide both a like-for-likes and total sales growth which results in the space contribution on &#x2013; by annual basis. What we have mentioned is that in terms of space maturity and the productivity of the space it remains very, very similar to what has been in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Looking at your inventory levels, it looks like you ended the quarter at quite a very lean inventory levels and then we obviously estimate what your square footage or square meter is &#x2013; are for the quarter which on our estimate is down about 16% inventory per square meter. Does that sound reasonable and is that sustainable or do you think you're running at too lean an inventory level at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The inventory position is just for the finish time doesn't properly reflect the commitment of the company at any given point in time. Our commitment <mark type="inaudible" /> and we have the stability to build inventory to meet demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you expect that with the online launch you are going to have to ramp-up that inventory level going into the Autumn/Winter season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not in a significant way but a significant <mark type="inaudible" /> in the inventory is &#x2013; could more up or down in any particular quarter because you close at a certain point in time. So it is not that relevant figure for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the visual lean level is not actually where you've been trading throughout the course of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I have not understood your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh sorry. The numbers as far as &#x2013; how you could calculate it is in fact not how it's been progressing throughout the quarter. It's just because of specific period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Karen. What we mentioned is that inventory is the picture of a given moment, but it's not the way we manage the &#x2013; what we do is to manage the commitment. So the inventory or inventory per square meter is not the relevant figure in the way we manage the business.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning this is Pedro Balcao here from Santander. I wonder if you could give us a rough idea of what is currently the gap between sales and sourcing in terms of euro. I mean, what is the current rate of euro sales on total sales and what is the current rate of sourcing in euros over total sourcing? And how do you see this evolving during the year and during the next few years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, nothing has changed <mark type="inaudible" /> with what we have transmitted in previous times. As you know, our sourcing we have more or less 50% of our sourcing in proximity which is euro denominated. Then we have around 15% of our sourcing in Turkey, and then 35% of our sourcing in Asia. These would be our dollar exposure.</p>
          <p>And regarding our sales, well, it's a very diversified platform of sales, but if you think about the geographies different from Europe, well you could have around 70% of our sales in euros and 30% of our sales in different currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And in this first quarter, the weight of sourcing in euros or proximity or specifically Spain and Portugal was not bigger than usual, that's what you are saying here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Could we just &#x2013; just a follow-up on the proximity sourcing issue that obviously given the movements in exchange rates over the last six months or so and also given rapid increases in labor rates in China, how much do you think you could physically change in terms of kind of shifting production back to Turkey and back to proximity markets? Is there a cost advantage to doing so and can you physically do that in terms of different products and different skill sets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not planning to change our sourcing structure. We think our sourcing structure is very balanced depending on the type of foods, and we are not planning to change our sourcing structure. As you know also, regarding our Asian sourcing, we have long-term relationships with our suppliers. And we are not planning any significant change regarding our sourcing policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just ask a follow-up on your e-commerce? You talked about expanding Zara into other markets. What are your thoughts at the moment about launching some of the other brands into e-commerce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you know that with Zara Home we are already present in &#x2013; since a little bit more than two years ago. And you could expect the launching of the other formats on e-commerce in the coming years I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And has the technical facility been built into the DCs of the other brands yet?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you upgraded Zara's DCs over the last couple of years, the kind of potential to do e-commerce was very much built into that, and I was wondering if the kind of the same technical facility was built into say the Vertica DC and <mark type="inaudible" /> DC so that you actually don't need to spend any significant amounts of money specifically to get the infrastructure in place to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Just one question left, just an update on your FX hedging. I assume <mark type="inaudible" /> hedged for 1H '11 and I was wondering if you would see a negative impact from the strengthening dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You know that as we have been discussing, the company has not the relevant exposure to a currencies. Obviously we hedged part of the net short position we have in dollars. But all in all, even the platform that we manage in which proximity represents a very strong part, we &#x2013; you must not expect very significant changes in the gross margin evolution in any given year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you say significant because you've seen, I think, a 100 bps change in the past, which is not insignificant and given the recent volatile and strong dollar movement is the 100 bps significant for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>100 bps basically you know that we try to follow an approach in which we see stable as 50 basis points positive or negative. 100 bps in most companies is a very, very mild, I would say, gross margin impact.</p>

          <p>Following question comes from Fraser Ramzan from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question about your balance sheet. Your inventories are down by 10%. Your payables are up by about 25%. And your fixed assets are down, despite the fact you've opened 100 stores. That's very, very good working capital management on any level. And I am just wondering if you could explain what specific actions you've taken to manage your inventory and your working capital position over the course of the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then also just on top of that, obviously, you've opened 98 stores year-to-date, which is a very significant proportion of the total. You have said previously, it will be second half loaded, so should we assume therefore that the second quarter will have a relatively small number of openings when we think about the half year as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well regarding your first question, it has a lot to do with our business model. It has a lot to do with our sourcing in proximity. The lead times, it's managing our business model and that is what we try to do everyday to continue managing our business model in the best possible way. And yes, we have negative working capital because of this, and then of course the very good evolution of sales also is helping this evolution of the working capital.</p>
          <p>Regarding the store opening plan, you could assume around 35% of the openings in the first half and between &#x2013; 35 and 40% in the first half and between 60 and 65% of the openings in the second half as we anticipated to you in the full year results presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate you are managing your working capital well and you've alluded to that already. You also said that one shouldn't look at a single point in time as necessarily representative of the inventory position for the quarter. I presume that's the same for payables as well. So should one assume that working capital will be &#x2013; will see some reversals some of those line items into the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. I think the best way to look at the working capital is for the full season because, again, the evolution of both payables and receivables over a quarter may be misleading for the total first quarter. But all-in-all clearly we have been using significantly sourcing in proximity and this is the impact you have mainly in the working capital in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And intangible fixed assets actually down year-on-year is that a function of sort of when the capital flowed for the first quarter openings, either, much of it was booked in the final quarter last year, so therefore your CapEx is around below depreciation in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more in line with the CapEx levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because as you know, for example, e-money is part of the CapEx. So that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to the second reason for gross margin expansion you talked about, the use of proximity sourcing <mark type="inaudible" /> sales growth. What exactly do you mean by this benefit to gross margin? Are you saying that this is a scale benefit to margins from higher volumes perhaps you could just clarify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What we mean is that both our sourcing in proximity and sourcing in other origins have contributed to the gross margin expansion in the quarter. Regarding our sourcing in proximity it has helped us to increase the volume of high turning items. This is what we means with this comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just &#x2013; could we just come out to Pull &amp; Bear as well and last year EBIT margins fell quite sharply and your charts in your presentation show that sales in Q1 slightly underperformed the other Concepts. Are you taking any specific actions to improve the performance of Pull &amp; Bear that maybe you could talk about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This is something very minor I would say. It will always be the case having some different formats as we have. A different format will always have one or two overperforming and one or two underperforming but in a very slight nothing significant, nothing to be worried about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question from Richard Chamberlain from the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I just got a couple of follow-ups, just one on the online offer. I was wondering if you could say what percentage of product returns you are expecting in clothing when you launched. And also I think you mentioned Pablo that you've opened a 1,500 square meter store in Shanghai. It sounds like a flagship. Is the average size of Zara stores kind of going to be increasing now over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, about the percentage of returns regarding online is something which is difficult to predict. We are used to a big percentage of returns in our stores because as you know our return policy is extremely easy, in fact we have many customers who prefer not to try their garments in the stores, they take three or four things. They go home and then they come back returning one or two which by the way is not bad news because they come back to our stores. So it's always a possibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are quite used to a significant percentage of return. Of course in internet it could be bigger but this is something that we think we would perfectly able to manage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have built different scenarios with different percentages so it's not something about which we are particularly concerned.</p>
          <p>And regarding the size of our stores, no the typical Zara store is between 1,500 and 2,000 square meters and this continues being the case. Of course when you are finding a high street location then you need to adapt a little bit Zara store to this very good location; sometimes it bigger as it could be for example the case in Chicago, Michigan Avenue. We were mentioning this is quite a big store. And sometimes depending on the location it's a slightly a smaller, but we are not planning to change the average size of Zara stores, which is between 1.5 and 2,000 square meters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: Well, right now is moment in time just to address the questions we have just received through the online platform. So basically there are number of questions that were trying to obtain some further detail regarding the FX impact both top-line gross margin. I think, this has already been properly answered.</p>
          <p>Another one, which is trying to obtain the expectation for our gross margin for the full year. I think it has been already covered as well.</p>
          <p>There is a question regarding online, which is if we are expecting any kind of cannibalization within existing Zara stores coming from the Zara online launch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not. We think it's going to be complimentary; it's going to be additional sales.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: Following on the online sales a question about any specific plan for launching online sales in the USA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the U.S. is very relevant market for internet sales and as I was saying you before during the year 2011, we want to be present with our offer online in the most relevant markets in the world and this includes the U.S. market.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: Perfect. Just moving on there is a question talking about &#x2013; well, trying to obtain some information about the different geographical markets and the way they are developing. It's a quarterly result, I don't know if you want to provide any further color or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as you know we prefer not to talk very much in our quarterly results about the performance by region or by geography.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: Another question coming from the evolution of the purchasing prices in the different producers &#x2013; from the different producers. If there is any significant change in the trend in these type of prices in different regions of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is what we were answering also during the Q&amp;A session that we have a very special sourcing model. We have 50% of our sourcing in proximity. Then we have a 35% of Asian sourcing with very long-term relations with our suppliers. So we are not expecting significant changes.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: Another question regarding expansion is about any plan to open non-Zara Concepts either in Japan or the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It always can be the case. It always can be the case to launch new Concepts in the different markets. For example in the Asian markets in China we are already present, not only with Zara but also with Massimo Dutti, with Bershka, with Pull &amp; Bear, with Stradivarius. So it always could be the case to introduce new brands in the different markets.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: Just received another question which is trying to obtain information about the evolution of the unit production cost in proximity. I think that have been already covered.</p>
          <p>And the two final questions we have first one relates to the cash position of the company and the potential use of cash at fiscal year end.</p>

          <p>Yes. I would say that nothing really new regarding this and our first priority regarding the use of cash is to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company. Of course, we want to maintain at the same time attractive and predictable shareholders remuneration policy. We are generating a significant cash flow and we are able to combine these two polices to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company to maintain a high level of flexibility and a disciplined financial approach with predictable and attractive shareholders remuneration policy. In fact this year we had a dividend &#x2013; the Board of Directors' proposal to the shareholders' meeting is to increase by 14% dividend, half of that 6% per share was already paid and half of that will be paid at the beginning of November, so nothing really new to say about the use of the cash we generate.</p>
          <p> &lt;A&gt;: And then the final question would be the plans for our expansion in India in next years and also I would say the relative importance of India within the Asia as a whole for the Group.</p>

          <p>About India I would like to say that the initial reception to our opening in Delhi has been very, very good. As we were saying during the presentation, tomorrow we are opening our first store in Mumbai; then in the coming weeks a second store in Delhi and before the end of the year; a third store in Delhi.</p>
          <p>And thinking about next year we are planning to continue with selected openings in Delhi and Mumbai and to begin to move to different cities such as Bangalore, Pune, different Indian cities. So within that we will open stores in the coming years. We are not expecting nothing similar to the number of openings that we have in China but progressively step-by-step India will become a relevant Asia market for us.</p>
          <p> Operator: So no further questions.</p>
