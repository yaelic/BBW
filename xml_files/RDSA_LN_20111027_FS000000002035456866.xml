          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q3 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our host, Mr. Simon Henry. Please go ahead, Sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Operator. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Third Quarter 2011 Results Presentation. I'll take you through the results and some of the portfolio developments in the quarter and leave plenty of time for your questions. First, the usual cautionary statement.</p>
          <p>We continued to make good progress with our strategy, improving our competitive performance, delivering growth for our shareholders. Third quarter underlying earnings were $7 billion. Earnings per share increased by 40% from the third quarter 2010. With $1.8 billion of divestment in the quarter we've already passed our $5 billion asset sales target for the year earlier this year, with more to come.</p>
          <p>Our share buyback program restarted in August with $800 million done in the third quarter. Underlying oil and gas production increased by 2%, and that's driven by the continued progress in Qatar and in Canada. And we're maturing new projects for medium-term growth with exploration success in French Guiana, Australia, and also launching new Upstream development projects.</p>
          <p>So we are making good progress against our targets to deliver a more competitive performance from Shell. So let me give you a few more details starting with macro environment.</p>
          <p>If you look at the macro picture compared with the third quarter of 2010, oil and gas marker prices have increased from year-ago levels, although Henry Hub price is broadly similar. The discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to Brent widened to $24 per barrel in the third quarter, and that compares with less than $1.00 a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas realizations increased from the second quarter in 2011, whereas the oil realizations actually declined sequentially. Industry refining margins diverged in the quarter with improved margins in the US West Coast, but declines in all the other regions. In Chemicals, industry margins increased from year-ago levels, especially in the US, although we did see a decline in margins in Asia. We saw signs of a slowdown in demand at the end of the quarter in several of our Downstream businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning now to earnings overall. The CCS earnings, current cost of supplies, for the quarter including identified items were $7.2 billion. Excluding those identified items, the CCS earnings were $7.0 billion, and earnings per share increased by 40%.</p>
          <p>On a Q3 to Q3 basis, we saw higher earnings in both Upstream and in Downstream. Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion, and dividends in the quarter were $2.6 billion, of which $700 million was settled with new shares under the scrip dividend program. We're offering that scrip dividend again for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We restarted the share buyback program in August. This was at the time when financial markets were weak, and it's a good time to be buying back stock. This buyback program is part of the overall program to offset the dilution from scrip dividends, which have totaled $3.2 billion since we launched the scrip a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now let me just talk a bit more about the business performance in a little bit more detail, firstly, the Upstream. Excluding identified items, Upstream earnings were $5.4 billion in the third quarter, and that's an increase of 58% versus the same quarter in 2010. These earnings were driven by higher oil and gas prices and also a very positive environment for LNG (liquefied natural gas) trading.</p>
          <p>Our Upstream earnings were similar to the previous quarter, to second quarter 2011, despite the $3.60 decline in the Brent price. Natural gas and LNG were an important part of that good performance, where gas is priced primarily on lagging oil markers. Shell's LNG business did very well in the quarter with growth in a good marketing environment. Our integrated gas earnings, which is essentially the LNG business, have more than doubled from year-ago levels.</p>
          <p>The Headline oil and gas production for the third quarter was 3.0 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, and that's an increase of 2% excluding the asset sales impacts. The LNG sales volumes grew by 12% Q3 to Q3, and that mainly reflects the successful ramp-up in Qatargas 4.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Downstream. Excluding their identified items, the Downstream earnings increased by 25% from year-ago levels; they reached $1.8 billion in the quarter. Our Oil Products results were similar to a year ago, with higher numbers from Chemicals. The Chemicals results were strong, lifted by higher margins in the US and in Europe, although weaker margins in Asia.</p>
          <p>In Oil Products, the results were firm in a difficult industry environment. The earnings were similar to year-ago levels despite asset sales in the interim and some unfavorable exchange rate movement in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And Chemicals availability, plant availability, it decreased compared with the same quarter last year due to maintenance. Refinery availability, though, increased from year-ago, better levels, and also compared with the second quarter 2011, when we had actually quite major turnaround programs.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter, there was a fire at our Bukom refinery in Singapore, and that did impact both refining and chemicals operations there. We are now in the process of restarting our facilities, and we're looking into the causes of the incident in the first place. We would expect to see around $150 million of net impact to the earnings for this incident in the fourth quarter results. They will not be treated as an indentified item.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're expecting worldwide refinery availability for the current quarter &#x2013; i.e., the fourth quarter &#x2013; to be broadly similar to the fourth quarter 2010 levels, although Chemicals will be slightly lower.</p>
          <p>So those are the overall earnings. Turning to the cash flow. The cash generation on a rolling basis, a rolling 12-month basis, was $53 billion; that includes $11 billion of disposals proceeds. And that's against an environment with an average Brent oil price of $106 per barrel. Both the Upstream and the Downstream business segments generated surplus cash flow after investment.</p>
          <p>And that gave us a free cash flow position, which combined with &#x2013; a positive free cash flow position &#x2013; which combined with our capital spending, dividend, and buyback programs has resulted in a decline in the balance sheet gearing. Gearing in the end of the quarter sat at 10.8%. That compares with 12% at the end of the second quarter, moving lower in the 0% to 30% expected range. Of course, you would expect this in the strong oil price conditions that we've been seeing.</p>
          <p>Divestment of non-core assets is an important element to Shell's capital efficiency, also our portfolio enhancement program. We've sold some $34 billion of assets now in the last five years. That's a rollover in that period of around 20% of the total capital employed. We completed $1.8 billion of asset sales in the third quarter. These included the sale of the Stanlow refinery in the UK and non-core upstream assets in the Americas. We passed the target for $5 billion of asset sales that we set earlier this year.</p>
          <p>There are further asset sales in the works, for example, Downstream business in Africa and the gas pipelines in Norway. These should complete across the end of this year or early in 2012. Asset sales will continue as part of the overall strategy; however, the pace will probably slow down from here after what's been a very active period in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Before we close, let me update you on progress with the growth portfolio in the quarter. We have more than 20 new project start-ups planned for 2011 to 2014, the four-year period. Those projects will deliver some 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production. These are the new projects which underpin our cash flow and production growth targets.</p>
          <p>In Canada, the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, the first Expansion, has ramped up and it should now stabilize at its plateau rate in the near future. In Qatar, at Pearl Gas-to-Liquids, it's a similar story. Train 1 has now pretty much ramped up, and we're working to reach sustained plateau rates. Train 2 should start up as planned before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>The two growth projects in Qatar &#x2013; that's Qatargas 4 and GTL &#x2013; and the Athabasca Mine Expansion in Canada, they added some 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Shell in the third quarter. That compares with the total expected peak production from the three projects of some 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, still some way to go of course for that. These start-ups reflect some of Shell's unique strengths in the energy industry today: innovative technology, integration across value chains, and creating long-life returns for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now we've also made progress with maturing new projects for medium-term growth delivery during the quarter. In Australia, the Arrow coal bed methane LNG project entered detailed design, what we call FEED, for an 8 million ton per annum, 2 train LNG project. Arrow has made an offer to acquire Bow Energy in Australia with further gas resources in this play that could increase the size of the LNG trains by more than 10%.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere we announced two final investment decisions on two non-operated developments: the Clair Phase 2 development in the UK; and the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia. Together these two projects are expected to add around 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Shell at their peak production level. We've also gone ahead with an innovative LNG scheme in Canada called the Green Corridor that will take onshore gas production into small-scale LNG. That LNG will be  used for fuel in the trucking industry on long-distance routes.</p>
          <p>On the exploration side, we had good progress in our frontier exploration portfolio. We have new acreage positions onshore in the Americas and in the Ukraine, and offshore in New Zealand and Tanzania. In our actual operations we had a gas discovery offshore Australia and the Zaedyus oil discovery in French Guiana.</p>
          <p>So good progress on the growth portfolio. Just let me summarize before we go for your questions. Our performance in the quarter underlines that we are delivering on our strategy. Third quarter underlying earnings $7 billion; earnings per share up 40%; delivered higher year-on-year earnings in both Upstream and Downstream businesses. We've already passed our $5 billion asset sales target for the year; there's more to come. We've restarted share buybacks in the quarter, all part of the capital discipline in the company.</p>
          <p>The new projects, they are coming on stream as planned, and we're maturing new investments for the medium-term growth. We're making good progress against our targets to deliver a more competitive performance from Shell.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to move to take your questions. Please could we keep yourselves just to one or two so that everybody has the opportunity to ask a question. Many thanks for that.</p>
          <p>Operator, please could you now poll for questions? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Theepan Jothilingam from Nomura International. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, two questions please. Firstly, just could you talk a little bit more about start-up costs, particularly for Qatar, how you think they could possibly drop off? I'm trying to sort of get a feeling for the ramp-up in cash flow over the next sort of 12, 18 months, please.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the portfolio, I guess the Woodside lock-up ends next month. If you could just remind us what your sort of position on Woodside is, and how you see that going forward? That would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Theepan. The start-up costs in Qatar and Oil Sands, basically the start-up costs already are now behind us in Oil Sands. And in Qatar LNG, up and running now, there's still some costs particularly associated with the start-up and ramp-up of Train 2 and the GTL ahead of us. It's really only of the order of a few hundred million dollars still to go. Difficult to separate out what has happened in the past from the future, but overall, there being that reduction as we go into next year, but it's only a few hundred million dollars, and that's pre-tax as well.</p>
          <p>I think that it's fair to say that we are now cash positive and income positive in Qatar overall, which is good to see, and we should somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion on both income and cash generation in Qatar for the year as a whole, so building up nicely there.</p>
          <p>Woodside, yes, you're correct. The 12-month lock-up area comes to an end in November. What we said about this is still pretty much the case. The reason for selling down in the first place was having developed a multiplicity of projects over which we had more direct influence and direct access to cash flows, such as Gorgon and Prelude, and then Arrow. Woodside became less of a strategic necessity or asset in the portfolio. And that it was probably the right thing to do to monetize for right value for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now we're not really in a hurry to do anything; we can take our time. But essentially we would like to, over time, recycle the value back into other parts of the portfolio. It does form part of the overall capital discipline process in the company, but there's no particular urge to act quickly.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Kim Fustier from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if I may. First of all in Alaska, I think the US EPA has recently issued clean air permits. Could you just comment on where you stand at the drilling process? And beyond these clean air permits, are there any other milestones that we need to watch out for?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on the Downstream, I think we saw a visible contribution from Reizen in your downstream earnings this quarter. Could you talk about the earnings power you expect from that JV in the medium term and the associated CapEx requirements? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kim. Alaska. Yes, it was good to see that the clean air permits were issued. We're now in permitting sense further than we've been before. You could say we're in uncharted territory. And we have been working to a timetable in terms of approval and various permits, and we're pretty much keeping to the timetable that would enable drilling up to three wells next year.</p>
          <p>That could not begin before July. To do that we need rigs available plus all of the associated activities, which include over 30 support vessels of one kind or another. That is all in the process of being put in place, so logistically we are getting ready. And subject to getting ultimate approval, we will be ready to drill from July next year.</p>
          <p>The one thing that is a bit out of our control is there are already, and no doubt there will continue to be, one or two legal challenges, including in the Ninth Circuit where we have been before. We are not obviously in control other than the fact that we must prepare as professionally and as well as possible in terms of meeting all the requirements to drill. So everything in terms of the permitting process is on track to drill next year. It's what you need to, and we need to, look closely at is the various legal processes. They're not under the control of the regulator.</p>
          <p>Reizen. Just a reminder for those who don't know, Reizen became effectively operational in April this year, so second quarter of operation. It's a $12 billion joint venture with Cosan, a Brazilian company, 50/50. The world's largest sugar-to-ethanol producer and also the owner and operator of just under 4,500 retail gas stations in Brazil, a fast-growing market, over 20% market share in the country.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter we did see a positive earnings contribution of around just under $200 million, which is good to see. We expect generally to get a positive earnings contribution from Reizen. It's operating in a market we know well in the Downstream. And at the moment, sugar and ethanol prices are both reasonably attractive. Both of them happen to be a little bit volatile there, so we do expect some volatility in earnings coming from Reizen. But so far so good, up and running, great growth prospects.</p>
          <p>CapEx, the growth prospects we acknowledge. We are the biggest, but we're only 8% of the market in Brazil today, so great opportunity to grow there. You may recall the way we structured the transaction. We inject $1.6 billion of cash into the joint venture; that essentially is already covered by our CapEx even though we've not injected it all yet, this year's CapEx. That CapEx from Shell injected into the venture will form the funding for Reizen's own CapEx within the joint venture. So certainly for the next two to three years we don't expect to see any further Shell CapEx going in.</p>
          <p>Obviously the longer you go out the more it depends on two things. One is, what level of growth they achieve; and secondly, the dividend stream that we see coming out to the company. So, so far, so good.</p>
          <p>Many thanks. We'll move to the next question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Martin Wraps (21:49) from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I wanted to ask two questions. First of all, can I ask you, can you update us on your thoughts on the dividends, particularly with the cash flow so strong and the balance sheet de-gearing? And also from an operational perspective, quite a bit of de-risking going on lately with several project start-ups.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I wanted to ask you about the under-spend in terms of CapEx this year, which seems to be coming in a little bit below what you were talking about earlier in the year, and whether this has any meaningful impact on production and earnings power with the firm, sort of next year and into the year thereafter? Or whether this is just a timing issue and the impact will overall be negligible for the next couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Martin. The dividend. The cash flow has been strong, the gearing is now down at 10.8%. We are targeting, as I'm sure you're all aware, positive free cash flow next year above $60, assuming that we have a net capital investment of $25 billion to $27 billion. What I've said previously is that really we need to get back to that structural positive free cash flow position from delivering the major projects before we look to grow the dividend.</p>
          <p>We are on track to get there. And we will likely practice to start the year with a stronger balance sheet than we'd previously expected. And really that's a decision and a communication for next year.</p>
          <p>I have to say that we have to look at dividend capital investment, or net capital investment, and the position of the balance sheet together because the three are linked. But we're clearly in a much stronger position once the new projects come on stream and are fully up and generating cash. That's no real change from previous statements, by the way.</p>
          <p>CapEx, understand for the year-to-date we've actually spent in a gross sense, total sense, and in nine months, just over $20 billion. We have always said we'll spend between $25 billion to $30 billion, and typically it's more likely to be closer to $30 billion, offset by divestment.</p>
          <p>Now net capital investment &#x2013; i.e., deducting investments &#x2013; obviously are quite low, because we're effectively spending a bit slower on the cap, on the organic investment, and we're divesting a bit more quickly. So our net capital investment of $14 billion year-to-date does indicate that we're most likely to undershoot the $25 billion net. It most likely will be in the low 20s.</p>
          <p>We do expect the organic growth investment to increase in the fourth quarter. It's been increasing quarter-by-quarter all year as we've seen the impact of the big projects rolling off in the early part of the year; the new projects, for example Prelude and Gorgon kicking in; and some of the other investment decisions we've taken this year.</p>
          <p>So our actual organic investment is back up at a level of around about $8 billion per quarter anyway. So I would expect to get to $28 billion, $29 billion gross for this year, and most likely investing in that same kind of level next year. Then the net investment will be six, seven, eight divestments depending, this year, on how many we actually conclude before the year end. We do expect the total level of divestments to come off a bit as I said in the speech. So back more towards the two to three a year average level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. But given the situation in the Gulf of Mexico earlier in the year, I think you didn't spend as much as you were planning in the Gulf. And also with low gas prices in the United States, I thought your investments in tied gas projects in the United States would be less. And obviously if you spend less now, you'll produce less later. I mean, I was wondering what the impact would be of that? It seems pretty much a US question, actually, now that I think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true. We would have liked to have spent more on both in practice because we knew pretty much what the Gulf situation was. We didn't actually plan to spend more; we would like to have spent more. So our plans for next year did recognize that we're 50,000 barrels a day short of Gulf production this year due to the Macondo incident, and we'll be quite short next year as well. Exactly how much depends on what original assumptions you made, so it's less than we would like, let's just put it that way.</p>
          <p>On the gas side there's quite a bit of back-end of the year production, so by the end of the year, our production will be around about where we projected on the gas. But the average for the year has effectively come out at a lower level because of the phasing of the spend.</p>
          <p>So likelihood is, in both cases it doesn't make the target in 2012 any easier, but they were built in to projections that we've made. And just to be clear overall, assuming we get back up to speed in those areas, we are going to be back up at the top end of the range of that CapEx spend next year; that's my expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Yes, thank you. Hi, Simon. I got just a couple of questions picking up on a couple of the questions that have been asked already. The first is on the Gulf. I mean, would it make sense and do you have the capacity to actually run at a faster rate than maybe you would've done historically to bring, I'm guessing, production, importantly, because that's NPV, on stream quicker through the last half of this year and into next year and get those high value barrels on?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on the structure of your cash flow. I guess, one could observe that a significant portion of the cash flow, or an unusually high portion of the cash flow in 2012, '13, '14, is going to be effectively cost oil, cost gas, if you want, from some of the big projects you've got on. Does that influence your decision about how you use that cash, because some of it is essentially structured in capital rather than ongoing revenue coming back in? I mean, in terms of dividend, share buybacks, balance sheet management, et cetera. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Jon. The Gulf of Mexico, can we run faster? Well, yes. We've got five floating rigs. We're just operating one platform rig at the moment, so six drilling activities. And we could ramp-up a couple more rigs were we, to have the permits in place.</p>
          <p>We have done pretty well in terms of returning to activity on a competitive basis. We've been fortunate to have more permits in place earlier than others. Having said that, the average time to get a permit is currently running over 200 days. It used to run something like 50 days to 60 days. And while we're doing better than that 200, we need to keep moving on a significant number of permits to be able to keep just the five rigs busy, let alone more than that.</p>
          <p>We do have the opportunity. We've got quite a lot of development drilling to do around the Perdido, Mars, Cardamom, as well as the exploration discoveries that we're following up around Appomattox. So could go faster, would like to go faster, constraint is not us. It's, can we work our way quickly enough through the permitting process, which is becoming reasonably well established now and a good constructive process. It's just taking a bit more time.</p>
          <p>Cash flow structure 2012, 2014. We've not got that many PSCs coming on. The only one really is Pearl GTL, obviously a big one. I think you've kind of seen from some of the charts we've produced recently that the cost recovery does not, or, I should say, our cash generation doesn't end with the cost recovery. We've got pretty strong underlying cash flow generation post full cost recovery period, and it's about seven or eight years at $70. Obviously it's a shorter period if the price were to be higher.</p>
          <p>No, we don't think of the cash flow coming in, in any different terms as to what we should do with it. Cash is essentially fungible. We have strong cash flows well beyond the end of full cost recovery in Pearl. And same is true on most of our other PSC activity. Total PSC activity is just over 20% of production, definitely will have gone up from just under 20% of production by the time Pearl is up fully running. So I think it's about 23% next year. And so we don't think differently. And we have plenty of other sources of cash flow that will be generating growth in that period.</p>
          <p>Hope that helps. Thanks. Next question.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Irene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions please. So first, you resumed the share buyback in the quarter aiming to neutralize the dilutive effect of the scrip. So the scrip is not actually saving any cash. I struggle to understand why you're still offering the scrip as an alternative?</p>
          <p>My second question was on production, if there is any guidance you can provide short-term? So for Q4, in terms of what you expect coming back from maintenance from the Gulf of Mexico recovery and obviously the new projects? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Irene. I guess probably a little explanation on the scrip is helpful. This was not a tactical move to generate short-term cash or reduce outgoing. It was a strategic long-term move to offer the scrip program to shareholders at their option. So it's not being forced upon shareholders, hopefully. Some shareholders find it valuable. And in fact, roughly 30% on average, although there has been some quarterly volatility, have done so; $3.2 billion worth over the past four quarters.</p>
          <p>So for us what it does is creates more cash flow flexibility through cycle. Our industry is a constant battle between volatile revenues and relatively constant or difficult to vary in the short term cash outflows, such as investments as dividends. So we need to commit to be able &#x2013; or have a balance sheet structure and a financing that enables us to commit to long-term investments. The scrip gave us just a little bit more flexibility in doing that. And it's equivalent roughly to a $10 per barrel reduction in the breakeven price. That's the way it's actually worked out in the practice.</p>
          <p>We also said we aim to buy back through cycle in a way that offsets the dilution. And in practice, we'd like to do that at a price below what we issued the scrip at, which is what we've done. So there was an element of opportunity, the market's weak, buyback while the cash flow is strong. That doesn't mean we will continue necessarily. It's not a bad place to be with low gearing, strong cash availability, and liquidity in a period of what might be some macro uncertainty over the next 12, 18 months.</p>
          <p>And production guidance are all Q4 anyway, and can't really give precise guidance, though, although you do pick up a couple of important points.</p>
          <p>Qatar ramp-up, we have potentially some tens of thousands of barrels to come just from Train 1 ramp-up. Train 2 isn't likely to have much impact. It's more likely to come in towards the end of the quarter. And Qatar and Athabasca won't &#x2013; Qatargas 4 and Athabasca may add a little bit of volume in the quarter, but there's not too much more there in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We did have some maintenance shutdowns in both the North Sea and in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly in the Gulf in the <mark type="ph" /> Aqeeq (34:39) and Holstein, which is not operated by ourselves. Hopefully, that will come back.</p>
          <p>There is a bit of upside, but the main factor for fourth quarter production, as always, is the weather in Europe. And fundamentally, our gas production is tied quite closely to the temperature. So far, it's not been particularly cold. It was a relatively cold quarter last year, I think, so that's the main factor outside our control. Hopefully, that helps give you some indication of the things to watch for.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks to me like you've got at least four options in front of you for exploiting the BTU discrepancy in North America between accrued or liquids or refined products on the one side and natural gas prices on the other. You've got what seems to be a brewing potential for liquids-rich shale transactions, you and everybody else, which might speak to the potential price points or lack of attractiveness there, depending on the base, and I understand you want to be quiet about that.</p>
          <p>You've got Western Canada export of LNG potential, which you've clearly done in the past outside of North America, northeast ethane cracker, and then, now a US Gulf Coast-based GTL plant. Can you rank those options for me?</p>
          <p>And as it relates to GTL plant, it seems as though it might be a pretty capital-intensive option. I know you've done well with Pearl, but is the cost of construction not perhaps higher on the US Gulf Coast versus Qatar? And even though the shale gas keeps seeming to get better as a feedstock, it seems tough to meet the bar set by the North Field at Qatar from a cost of supply standpoint. Any thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert. You've done your homework. Unfortunately, you missed one; it was the Canadian Green Corridor, the gas to LNG effectively <mark type="ph" /> strengthens the plans (36:46)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest one of all, I guess. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Into liquids transport. So priority is a question of two things: one, overall economic and strategic attractiveness; and secondly, the timescale of doability. Clearly, that one is doable more quickly, and therefore the liquids-rich shale gas falls in that category as well. And yes, we are active, although so far minimal impact on results. So those are the top two in the short term; direct access to the, effectively, the liquids pricing in the North American market.</p>
          <p>The other three, the export of LNG from British Columbia to Asia; ethane, potential ethane cracker in Pennsylvania; and potential gas-to-liquids on the Gulf Coast are all viable options economically, but none of them are going to happen in the short term, and they're all capital intensive.</p>
          <p>The most progress is essentially the LNG export where we're looking at land, pipeline, and production together with three Asian partners, PetroChina and Japanese and Korean partners. And it's still early stages, but that's generally an agreement in place and looking to put together the full value chain. Clearly attractive to take forward all our gas to Asia, where the price in the last quarter was around $15, so quite an arbitrage to support the investment.</p>
          <p>The other two, the ethane cracker and the US Gulf gas-to-liquids, it is a question of two things: one, the cost of development; and secondly, for how long do we think that the gas-to-liquids price differential will be sustained at a suitable level. At $4 gas and $100 oil, roughly $110 oil, today's price, both of them are economic, and whether we would go ahead immediately will actually depend on very much on where we think we can get the cost of both projects <mark type="ph" /> down (38:51), because we'd like to be robust against an environment rather less attractive than a $4 gas and a $100 oil.</p>
          <p>We need more confidence that we can get the economics to the point where it justifies what in both cases &#x2013; in fact, all three cases &#x2013; will be a multibillion-dollar investment for a 20-, 30-, 40-year investment horizon.</p>

And we're not yet at the point where we'd go to FEED. We are doing some design work, potential design work, and we've identified a couple of possible sites, but you're at least six, seven years away even if we took a decision tomorrow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Simon, I had a couple of questions about the trading environment in 3Q and its sustainability. First of all, your Downstream numbers look to handily beat the consensus, and that's actually been a fairly consistent pattern with your peer group. I was wondering if the large drop in crude prices over the course of the quarter, which obviously have subsequently rebounded, led to any outsize trading profits that would have shown up in the Downstream business?</p>
          <p>And then secondarily, the LNG trading environment was obviously strong in 3Q. Spot prices in Asia appear to actually be on the incline. Would you expect that the LNG trading environment gets better for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. Good questions, but volatility in the Downstream always will help the trading activity. Having said that, structurally, if you think of our portfolio, our  refining cover for marketing sales is reducing as we divest down our portfolio of refineries. Trading and supply activity &#x2013; that is essentially the way we join Upstream crude molecules through to customers &#x2013; is becoming more and more and more structurally a contributor to the value chain. And therefore our trading activity and the profits associated with it have grown steadily over previous years.</p>
          <p>This is not a Wall Street trading activity. We have a need to move crude through to products to our customers. Therefore, it's becoming much less meaningful over time to look at refining, trading, marketing as separate parts of a value chain. They're not independent. Though trading had a good contribution in the quarter, it was not necessarily driven just by crude price volatility; it was driven by all market opportunities between crude and customer.</p>
          <p>LNG trading, it was a good quarter, very much so. We actually had 26 cargo diversions; that's nearly double where we were a year ago. Partly that's driven by Asian demand, and partly it's driven because we, today, have access to more LNG on our own account to do that type of activity. Fundamentally, we're moving cargoes that were maybe initially planned for North America into higher value markets.</p>
          <p>In Europe where average realized gas price have been at $9, Asia around $15 for the quarter, so generally a good quarter of opportunity and demand for short-term delivery following the Fukushima accident earlier this year, and some of the choices in European energy policy has been quite good. And you need to look at both Downstream and Upstream trading as substantive, sustainable, and very important strategic value levers for Shell. They are not opportunistic and they are not short-term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A couple if I might. Firstly, can you just help me out with some numbers. I'm just trying to understand what happened to America's profit this quarter? I mean, I would have anticipated, given the improvement at AOSP that profits would move north. And also that you're not carrying any idle rig costs any longer, or that the idle rig costs were modest. And yet relative to Q2, profits are about $400 million down.</p>
          <p>And similarly, just looking at the profit breakdown post-exceptionals for other areas, which includes Qatar and includes Pearl, despite production being flat to up, the profit number has also made no headway. So perhaps there are &#x2013; if you can give me some insight and color on those figures it'd be helpful? And then I'll ask you a further one after that, if I might.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See how long the first one takes, Lucas. UA profit's relatively simple. You had some downtime in Oil Sands. The bitumen realized price in some weeks was in the $50s, as opposed to what you might have expected closer to WTI. And we had a lot of downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, mainly BP-operated assets in the <mark type="ph" /> Aqeeq (44:33), Holstein. And we did have some shut-in time, planned shut-in time, in Mars and Auger. So it had some temporary effects on the oily-over-liquid type activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Other includes Middle East, includes Qatar. Profits have actually declined despite, if anything, production being up overall for that region or the international, or the Other region.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The profitability's not picking up strongly yet in Qatar; it's a couple hundred million in the quarter. It's slightly better than it was, of course, now that Pearl is on, but although it was on to the same extent in Q2 as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. It's for both. Every quarter. It was more like breakeven in the earlier quarter. The profitability in Other, say, does include Africa, and Nigeria was, I think, slightly down as well. But nothing structural there in terms of longer-term implications. And in Russia, which can be &#x2013; in fact, it was probably about the same thinking in Russia. So there's nothing substantive behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just on the Downstream, I mean, I take it the Reizen profit is being taken in the Marketing and Supply business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On which basis there's a $500 million or so improvement in refining. How much of that is coming through from cost? How much of that has been about availability? Because margin hasn't really moved anywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the industry margins may not have moved, but our ability to take advantage of them was better in the quarter. And particularly in the Canadian refineries including <mark type="ph" /> Tonyer (47:12) in Toronto were able to take some advantage. There was a bit of advantage there, $150 million, $200 million, depending which way you calculate that round.</p>
          <p>And so refining out an improvement would help that, plus some of the differentials in Europe work in our favor. So we're a heavy diesel relative to the market diesel producer, and that's basically what helped. Plus, the availability was up at a much better level, and the non-availability on an unplanned basis was down to a more acceptable level. So it was one of our better quarters in terms of operational performance, but that's basically it.</p>

          <p>Firstly, is it possible that you can tell us the 800,000 barrels a day of production you're bringing on between '11 and '14, how the cash margins of that compare with the existing cash margins of your base business?</p>
          <p>And secondly, another topic. On exploration CapEx and well drilling, could you tell us what you think you're going to be spending and drilling this year in terms of numbers of wells, and how that compares to what you're expecting to do next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Iain. It's difficult to be too quantitative on the first question, the unit cash margins, because it depends what price you achieve. The one thing we have said...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say at $100.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On average, it's better. And that's what drives, for example, our 11% production increase between '09 and '12, 2009 to 2012, driving 50% more cash flow. It's fundamentally because the unit cash flows of the new production is better than the old. And the underlying driver, typically fairly clear, a lot of the new production is big iron. It's large capital investment, but go forward, low operating spend, operating cost spend, and quite limited future capital requirements in projects such as GTL, any LNG, or Ormen Lange or the Oil Sands.</p>
          <p>So the fundamental nature and shape of the portfolio has changed. They're all, you probably realize as well, they're in basically lower or more stable fiscal environments, and fiscal environments which have less of a creaming at higher oil and gas prices. So those are strategic choices which we're now seeing playing through in today's margins, and they will play through increasingly up to 2014.</p>
          <p>The exploration spend this year, likely to exclude a new acreage acquisition, which we have been doing quite a bit of. It's in the sort of $3.5 billion range. I'm not sure how many wells; difficult again to quantify because we have a lot of exploration wells onshore, at what, maybe somewhere between $3 million and $10 million a pop. But a significant number offshore, rather more each, more like $150 million each. I don't have a breakdown with me, but we are expecting to continue at at least that level. In fact, the new acreage we've taken on, very attractive, should help give us more of an opportunity going forward.</p>
          <p>What I would say is we're actually in the middle of some, or a beginning of some, exciting activity at the moment. We're still completing; we're sidetracking in French Guiana. We are &#x2013; we just farmed into the Petrobras opportunity in Tanzania, 50% there. We are drilling Appomattox, appraisal well in the Gulf of Mexico. We just spudded BMS-54, which is the 80% shale block in the pre-salt in Brazil. We are, hopefully, getting in a position to drill in Alaska. We are drilling in China onshore. And there's a lot of onshore activity in North America. So it's quite an exciting time and if anything we'll be looking to increase the level of activity next year.</p>

          <p>Hi, Mark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if I could. Could you be fairly specific in terms of what the volume contribution both liquids and gas of Pearl was in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just over 70,000 barrels a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Equivalents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you split that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Seriously. What I can tell you is the ratio of liquids to gas is higher now than it will be as we ramp-up. The bait worked out particularly liquids rich and in the lower ramp up phase. Good idea to call IR later on that one, I think. Sorry, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Other question, I was particularly surprised by the strength of the Chemicals earnings in the quarter. It seemed to have defied, particularly versus the preceding quarter, the second quarter, the trend in margins, and also a specific reference to the contribution of equity interest. Could you put some color on the Chemicals number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$670 million in the quarter, the best ever quarterly result. They clearly are benefiting structurally, because it's not necessarily top of the chemical cycle at the moment. They're benefiting structurally from that switch we talked about earlier in terms of gas feedstock in the US. We are continuing to do a little bit here, a little bit there in terms of investment and work-around work to ensure we're maximizing that opportunity in the US, which we're definitely benefiting from today in the manufacturing side; still seeing reasonable margins in the market there.</p>
          <p>Our Equity Chemicals includes activities in the Middle East and in China. They are both well positioned for the markets. Remember we're not a broad spread of particular &#x2013; of petrochemicals products. We're relatively specific, things like MEG, the polyols, and those are markets where we have a good position and did well in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>I have to say our Chemicals guys have been through so many product cycles. They've been telling us for about two years now that this particular bubble will burst. But it's continued with a pretty robust performance against a volatile environment and a not-that-easy macro position. So maybe they just have done well in restructuring for a more robust positioning through cycle. We're very pleased with what they've been able to deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just sneak in one other quick one. A comment on your average LNG realizations in the third quarter, say, versus the second or the year-ago? And I know they're up, but can you put some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely up against a year ago, and up against the second quarter overall on the grounds that there's a lagged oil price in here, so we're still benefiting from the rise of the oil price earlier in the year. Slightly offsetting that is quite a few of the diversions will be going into Europe. Now it's obviously better than sending them to North America, but on average is less good than into Asia. Those are the trends, but it's up in both cases.</p>
          <p>Okay. Could I &#x2013; I'll move on to the next question, please, Operator? Operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sir. The next question comes from Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Simon. Just a question on Arrow and down in Australia, I'm wondering if you're also looking at potentially some tight sands that are down below the coal seams across your joint venture there, your acreage?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just be interested if you could elaborate on one of your earlier comments on the demand slowdown you're seeing across some of your businesses. I presume it's in the Downstream. Could you say more on which product or which geography? Thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for that, Oswald. Arrow, we basically have two CBM or CSG, coal seam gas, positions. One in the Surat Basin; it's close to Brisbane. And one in the Bowen Basin, which we've just <mark type="ph" /> added, took (56:31) with the acquisition of Bow. In both cases our prime focus is on the coalbed methane rather than on gas and the tight sands. There is some in the area but that's not our prime focus.</p>
          <p>And demand slowdown, difficult to separate this one out as to what's actually structural and what can be due to weather or other factors, but it does look like there's a slowdown in North America and Europe, something around 2%. In the retail business is primarily where we've seen this. Our commercial sales were actually quite strong, so things like aviation and marine.</p>
          <p>On Chemicals, do seem to be, at least in the markets that we've seen, some slowdown in demand, although we maintained our positions reasonably well in Asia, Asia-Pacific. Can also be exacerbated a bit by the fact that new suppliers coming online as well. So sometimes difficult to separate the two. Chemical demand, which is often a precursor of further macroeconomic movements, was reasonably healthy in the US. So quite a mixed picture overall, but demand for liquid products in developed markets, new liquid fuels products, is by and large down a bit.</p>
          <p>Hopefully, that covers the pitch. Okay. And turning to the next question, please, Operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick question just to clarify another comment you made. When you're talking about the deceleration of the disposal program, are you talking of going back to the guidance that you gave us in February of around $3 billion per year, or is it going to be lower than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In divestments we'd always expect to be doing $2 billion or $3 billion a year. It's just normal business, turning over assets, late life or otherwise so. That's the kind of level. We may not decelerate there immediately. I mean, we started this year without too many more aspirations beyond that, but we may accelerate and effectively be a bit more successful. So it's just part of the normal business at the $2 billion or $3 billion level.</p>
          <p>Having said that, if you look back over this last six or seven years, the average is somewhere between $6 billion or $7 billion. So I mentioned $34 billion in five years in the speech. If you add a couple of years on, we're well over 14 months from then, somewhere around $45 billion, I think, that we sold in that period, and part of normal business and capital discipline within the company.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jeff Dietert with Simmons &amp; Company. A couple on the Downstream. Could you provide an update on the Motiva Port Arthur expansion, how far along in construction, when do you expect the initial ramp-up to start and complete full ramp-up?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you talked about the Singapore refinery restarting in the fourth quarter. Will that be back to normal operations this quarter, or will there be some lingering issues there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Port Arthur is 90% complete in terms of construction. We're already working on some of the units and due to warm them up and bring them in, but effectively won't have any impact on production until early next year. There are a multiplicity of units there. We're going from 325,000 barrels a day to around 600,000 barrels a day with full upgrading capabilities. So it's a very large activity. So we're warming up the utilities at the moment.</p>
          <p>The start-up is in and during the first half of 2012. We're on track for our expectations there, but limited impact, if any, on 2011; should start to see contributions from Q1 onward, 2012.</p>
          <p>In Bukom, we are bringing the units back up. We're not fully back up yet, but by the end of December we really ought to be back up to a full throughput. And the &#x2013; what we are &#x2013; you may recall the fire was actually in a pumphouse, a blending unit.</p>
          <p>So it wasn't a process unit. We have work around in place, but to get back to full capacity we do need to replace some of that capability, which takes time. We need to do it properly, but it's not large process-scale units that we're working on. So we should be back up really by the end of the year there. Hopefully that covers it. The $150 million I talked about in earnings impact addresses all of that downtime.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The final question comes from Jason Kenney from Santander. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully the best for last. So if the markets continue to stay weak, does Shell buy back more shares at the scrip dilution equivalent price? And secondly, on the Tanzania farm-in, when does that well complete? And can you say anything in terms of target size, even in the kind of elephant or big cat type of terminology?</p>
          <p>And then just following-up on the Motiva question earlier, could you give me an idea of the incremental cash flow outlook you're expecting once you get to full operational capacity there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. If the markets stay weak, we will continue the buyback program most likely unless the full price starts to fall as well. However, catching up with the scrip will take some time. We are limited, for technical reasons, to effectively B shares for the moment. And that limits the trading amount that we can actually do in a day to no more than 25% of the traded volume of the London market.</p>
          <p>So at the rate the scrip is being issued, we almost have to go at that rate to offset it in any given quarter. Therefore it's a bit of a moot question as to whether we'd go beyond the dilution if the markets remain weak. Good question to ask in a year's time maybe, if we've actually gotten to the catch-up point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll remember that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tanzania farm-in, quite excited about it; could be a good prospect. It's, as you're probably aware, a gassy play, so it's gas that we'd be looking for. Can't really give details on the target size. Hopefully, we will know more by the time of the next quarterly call. We're not the operators. I can't really give any details on timing.</p>
          <p>But we're very pleased to join Petrobras, good operator there, and look forward to the act. And we also have some other blocks in Tanzania that we've held for quite some years now, and they're actually in an area of interest to Zanzibar and Tanzania. So hopefully we can unlock those, and we've got quite interesting prospects overall in the region.</p>
          <p>Let's the see the cash flow uplift a little bit, and how long it's been to say what refining margin the season on the Gulf Coast. It's clearly full upgrading capacity, so it'll be at the top end of the yield capability and delivery; it can process just about any crude by the time it's up and running.</p>
          <p>And there's an extra 275,000 barrels a day of full upgrading capacity. So you'd probably do the sums yourself on what you think the refining capability or refining margins are going to be on the basis that this is a highly effective unit. I would like to say that as a joint venture the cash flow is actually the dividend coming out of Motiva. So it needs to be an assumption of dividends coming out. But by and large, it will be similar to the earnings.</p>
          <p>And hopefully that covers it. We do have actually one more question now, please, Operator.</p>

          <p>Hi, Lucy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You said in the past that you want some Qatargas 4 and <mark type="ph" /> MD Hill (1:05:30) both sort of fully ramped up. You might expect a $4 billion contribution in a $70 world. How might that change in a $100 world? And the second question was to see if you've given a guesstimate on where your Gulf volumes might be in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Qatar at $100. Can't really give you a figure there. It's partly confidential but clearly better than $4 billion. Back to the earlier question, clearly at $100 we're going to recover the cost in more like four, four plus or minus years rather than the seven or eight that it would take at $70.</p>
          <p>But essentially, it works like a standard production sharing contract, even though technically it's a revenue sharing contract. So, upside is pretty good. I will say that certainly for the next few years, the 400,000 barrels a day that we're expecting to produce in Pearl, in Qatargas 4, and in Athabasca Oil Sands, that, although that was stated obviously originally at $70, the production entitlement in the first few years doesn't change materially at $100, if that helps.</p>
          <p>And, sorry, I didn't know we had a question. Second question, Lucy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Gulf has declined. We're around 220,000, 230,000 barrels a day at the moment. We would hope &#x2013; Perdido's now up at 70,000 barrels a day and hopefully rising because drilling those development wells. We would hope to pick up at some point during the year, not clear exactly when, you need to operators to see the Tonga chute come online, and we've quite a bit of drilling to help sustain production over at  Auger, and Mars still to come.</p>
          <p>So we should reverse the decline that we've seen post-Macondo; difficult to say at this point exactly by how much. That's the best I can do for you, Lucy, I'm afraid.</p>
