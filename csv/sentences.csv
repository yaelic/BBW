95,"
            ",24,4,1391148,0,0,0,0,13,,,,,,,
96,"Hi, guys.",25,5,1391148,,0,0,0,9,,,,,,,
97,Good â€“ great quarter.,25,5,1391148,,9,1,1,23,,,,,,,
98,Good numbers.,25,5,1391148,,32,2,2,13,,,,,,,
99,I had a question on the Brazil operations and just what the 30% or 35% import tariff means.,25,5,1391148,,45,3,3,91,,,,,,,
100,Is that as big of a headwind as it sounds right now on your current sales there?,25,5,1391148,,136,4,4,80,,,,,,,
101,And how big of an impact will be having that factory there in Brazil?,25,5,1391148,,216,5,5,69,,,,,,,
102,Hello?,26,5,1391148,,0,0,6,6,,,,,,,
103,"Sorry, just give us one minute, please.",27,6,1391148,,0,0,0,39,,,,,,,
104,Okay.,28,7,1391148,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
105,Yes.,28,7,1391148,,5,1,1,4,,,,,,,
106,Hello?,29,8,1391148,,0,0,0,6,,,,,,,
107,Yes.,30,9,1391148,,0,0,0,4,,,,,,,
108,"Hi, there.",31,10,1391148,,0,0,0,10,,,,,,,
109,"Yes, the Brazil is a country on the emerging market.",31,10,1391148,,10,1,1,52,,,,,,,
110,It means they â€“ usually in the emerging market they have the high tariff for the imported vehicle to secure to their market.,31,10,1391148,,62,2,2,126,,,,,,,
111,"So that's the reason why that we started to make a factory in Brazil to come into the â€“ especially the C segment, that's very sensitive for the price.",31,10,1391148,,188,3,3,152,,,,,,,
112,Usually right now our sales in the Brazil is some SUV or the SUV or the largest sedan because that segment is not sensitive for the price.,31,10,1391148,,340,4,4,138,,,,,,,
113,So that our market share in Brazil is around 3%.,31,10,1391148,,478,5,5,48,,,,,,,
114,"So that sort of we started to produce from the Brazil, we expect that we can come into that high pressure market like the C segment market.",31,10,1391148,,526,6,6,139,,,,,,,
115,And then we expect we can increase into our the sales and market share in Brazil.,31,10,1391148,,665,7,7,81,,,,,,,
116,Got it.,32,11,1391148,,0,0,0,7,,,,,,,
117,So almost none of your sales today are in the C segment.,32,11,1391148,,7,1,1,56,,,,,,,
118,They're all in the higher segments?,32,11,1391148,,63,2,2,35,,,,,,,
119,"Well, that, are not at all, but we saw just a small amount of vehicle at that segment.",33,12,1391148,,0,0,0,86,,,,,,,
120,Okay.,34,13,1391148,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
121,And is there any figures or numbers you can put behind this?,34,13,1391148,,5,1,1,60,,,,,,,
122,"What does it do for your profitability to switch from importing in a scenario like that with such high tariffs, as far as margin improvement or is there any sort of calculations you've done on that?",34,13,1391148,,65,2,2,198,,,,,,,
123,"Sorry, this is the too early to the estimate that some of the profitability or some of the thing for that Brazil market.",35,14,1391148,,0,0,0,120,,,,,,,
124,Brazil is one of the growing markets.,35,14,1391148,,120,1,1,37,,,,,,,
125,So we are focusing more like kind of quantities than the qualities on this market.,35,14,1391148,,157,2,2,82,,,,,,,
126,"So by having the local production we can â€“ we can expand our sales, the market presence in the Brazilian market.",35,14,1391148,,239,3,3,114,,,,,,,
127,Okay.,36,15,1391148,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
128,"For the profit side, we have to know after the factories are running.",37,16,1391148,,0,0,0,69,,,,,,,
129,"And do you any figures for Russia which is further along, than Brazil then on â€“ I'm just trying to get a sense of what it means when you're largely importing and then shifting to local production, what sort of effect that has on your profits.",38,17,1391148,,0,0,0,244,,,,,,,
130,"Well, for the first year of the local production, usually we have a lot of the depreciation which impacts the loss and the profit side.",39,18,1391148,,0,0,0,135,,,,,,,
131,Thank you.,39,18,1391148,,135,1,1,10,,,,,,,

279,The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.,93,47,1430166,5,27,2,2,65,,,,,,,
280,[Instructions].,93,47,1430166,5,92,3,3,15,,,,,,,

282,"Operator, please go ahead.",93,47,1430166,5,170,5,5,26,,,,,,,
283,And there are no questions in the queue at this time.,94,48,1430166,4,0,0,0,53,,,,,,,
284,Actually we just had a question up here.,94,48,1430166,4,53,1,1,40,,,,,,,
285,We'll take your first question from Benjamin Moyer with BlackRock.,94,48,1430166,4,93,2,2,66,,,,,,,
286,"Yes, thanks, thanks.",95,49,1430166,7,0,0,0,20,,,,,,,
287,I guess this is a simple but complex question.,95,49,1430166,7,20,1,1,46,,,,,,,
288,"Given your revenue increase and your volume increase for the first nine months, which was quite large, the increase in your profit is â€“ although your rate of increase and profit exceeds your rate of increase in revenue, it doesn't seem to be that much scale benefit here.",95,49,1430166,7,66,2,2,273,,,,,,,
289,And I am wondering if you could â€“ I know the U.S.,95,49,1430166,7,339,3,3,51,,,,,,,
290,"dollar-wan moved against you, but the wan-euro moved in your favor, so I'm just wondering if you could kind of highlight some of the factors that may have depressed your profit growth in this nine-month period or in the last three months.",95,49,1430166,7,390,4,4,238,,,,,,,
291,"Mainly, the â€“ I can say, the first, our â€“ the volume growth, it was around 11% and the wholesale base around 10%, compared to the last year for the nine months.",96,50,1430166,,0,0,0,164,,,,,,,
292,"So it's one of the reasons, and another reason is our utilization was improved also, compared with the last year.",96,50,1430166,,164,1,1,113,,,,,,,
293,And then the â€“ for the profit side our ASP trend was something improved.,97,50,1430166,,0,0,2,74,,,,,,,
294,"We disclosed only our ASP, based upon Korean factories, but for the domestic sales from the Korean factory, I mean the ASP was increased around 4.3%, but export portion was increased to 18% compared with the last year, the nine months.",97,50,1430166,,74,1,3,235,,,,,,,
295,"So to combine those three factors, it brings to us the increase in our revenue and the profit side.",98,50,1430166,,0,0,4,99,,,,,,,
296,And then the thing that we are focusing on right now is the value pricing strategy.,98,50,1430166,,99,1,5,83,,,,,,,
297,"I mean based up on the strong need from the customer side, we tried our best to less depending over the incentives.",98,50,1430166,,182,2,6,115,,,,,,,
298,"So as you know the in the U.S., our incentive varies to the lowest level to U.S.",98,50,1430166,,297,3,7,80,,,,,,,
299,"$1,060 average achieved this September.",98,50,1430166,,377,4,8,39,,,,,,,
300,"And then â€“ we are keep going the platform in duration strategy, so the periods just on the third quarter the global base â€“ platform inflation proportion was increased at 55%.",98,50,1430166,,416,5,9,178,,,,,,,
301,Last year that was only 31% at the global basis.,98,50,1430166,,594,6,10,48,,,,,,,
302,"So when combing those two factors, the decrease â€“ the cost of the goods, so combing those factors our profits increase.",99,50,1430166,,0,0,11,121,,,,,,,
303,So I can't say that that's the reason why we can increasing the our revenue and profit also.,99,50,1430166,,121,1,12,92,,,,,,,
304,"Right, right.",100,51,1430166,7,0,0,0,13,,,,,,,
305,But I was kind of surprised that you didn't have a higher growth in profit.,100,51,1430166,7,13,1,1,75,,,,,,,
306,"So I was wondering, I understand those factors were all positive, but I was wondering what factors were negative for you outside of the won U.S.",100,51,1430166,7,88,2,2,144,,,,,,,
307,dollar?,100,51,1430166,7,232,3,3,7,,,,,,,
308,"One second, please...",101,52,1430166,,0,0,0,21,,,,,,,
309,"So actually the revenue growth is much less than the profit growth for Hyundai compared to the last year, same period.",102,52,1430166,,0,0,1,118,,,,,,,
310,The consolidated basis our revenue growth was 18% compared to the profit growth of 34%.,102,52,1430166,,118,1,2,87,,,,,,,
311,"Well, as Mr.",102,52,1430166,,205,2,3,12,,,,,,,
312,"Chung mentioned, it's caused by the higher integrated proportion and now we have much better economies of scale benefit here.",102,52,1430166,,217,3,4,125,,,,,,,
313,Okay.,103,53,1430166,7,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
314,And could I ask another question?,103,53,1430166,7,5,1,1,33,,,,,,,
315,Yes.,104,54,1430166,,0,0,0,4,,,,,,,
316,You have both your retail and your wholesale volume in this presentation.,105,55,1430166,7,0,0,0,73,,,,,,,
317,"So if I compare those two numbers, if I subtract your retail sales from your wholesale sales, that should give me the change in inventory, assuming these two numbers are comparable.",105,55,1430166,7,73,1,1,181,,,,,,,
318,"If so, it would appear that your global inventory decreased by around 70,000 units over the nine month, does this makes sense to you, or is it â€“ am I missing something here?",105,55,1430166,7,254,2,2,175,,,,,,,
319,"Yeah, well, it looks that way, so, well, it's not exact but almost a similar numbers you can...",106,56,1430166,,0,0,0,95,,,,,,,
320,Okay.,107,57,1430166,7,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
321,"So what's that â€“ you mentioned value pricing strategy and you are reducing your incentive, but what about the possibility that you will increase your price?",107,57,1430166,7,5,1,1,158,,,,,,,
322,"Or that you will increase, you raise the price more than the content, as the value of the content is increasing on your new products.",107,57,1430166,7,163,2,2,133,,,,,,,
323,"It seems that the supply for your product is tight globally, so there seems to be an opportunity for you to raise price, not just reduce your incentive, so what is your view on that point?",107,57,1430166,7,296,3,3,188,,,,,,,
324,"This year, we already increased MSRP for some of our models a couple of times already.",108,58,1430166,,0,0,0,86,,,,,,,
325,"And yes, first step to achieve the value pricing strategy is reducing the incentive, but after that, yes, we need to increase the MSRP.",108,58,1430166,,86,1,1,135,,,,,,,
326,Since we don't have much inventories and customers are still looking for the cars.,108,58,1430166,,221,2,2,82,,,,,,,
327,So I think there are possibilities that we can increase the price.,108,58,1430166,,303,3,3,66,,,,,,,
328,"On the MSRP increases that you just mentioned, could you just give me a few examples?",109,59,1430166,7,0,0,0,85,,,,,,,
329,"Were those on vehicles in the domestic market or were they exports, or is there any example that you can give me?",109,59,1430166,7,85,1,1,113,,,,,,,
330,"Well, in U.S.",110,60,1430166,,0,0,0,13,,,,,,,
331,"market the price of Sonata has been increased and also for some other models, not all the models, but some models that we maintain such a low inventories and high interest from the customers, yes, we did.",110,60,1430166,,13,1,1,204,,,,,,,
332,Okay.,111,61,1430166,7,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
333,And I don't know if there is no other questions -- maybe I should just let someone else ask a question.,111,61,1430166,7,5,1,1,103,,,,,,,
334,Okay.,111,61,1430166,7,108,2,2,5,,,,,,,

336,Okay.,113,63,1430166,7,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
337,"Operator, do we have any other questions?",114,64,1430166,,0,0,0,41,,,,,,,
338,We do have two others questions in the queue.,115,65,1430166,4,0,0,0,45,,,,,,,
339,Okay.,116,66,1430166,7,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
340,I'll stop.,116,66,1430166,7,5,1,1,10,,,,,,,
341,Okay.,117,67,1430166,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
342,The next we will hear from ,118,68,1430166,4,0,0,0,27,,,,,,,
343,"Hi, gentlemen.",119,69,1430166,,0,0,0,14,,,,,,,
344,"One question from me, it's regarding there's been some talk in the press about trade deals in the auto space between Europe and Korea, and I know some of the European companies have complained about barriers, of being able to penetrate the Korean market.",119,69,1430166,,14,1,1,254,,,,,,,
345,Can you talk about what those barriers are and are you concerned at all from some pretty competitive products from the likes of Volkswagens and BMWs and whatnot if there is some very favorable deals made with the Europeans?,119,69,1430166,,268,2,2,223,,,,,,,
346,Thanks.,119,69,1430166,,491,3,3,7,,,,,,,
347,Hold on a second.,120,70,1430166,,0,0,0,17,,,,,,,
348,Especially European makers we had FTA's agreement with the EU.,121,70,1430166,,0,0,1,62,,,,,,,
349,"So well, we reduced the tariff imported from the European countries, since July this year.",121,70,1430166,,62,1,2,90,,,,,,,
350,"So but they can have much better price competitiveness in domestic markets and we recognized that in domestic market, their market shares or the sales has been increased dramatically.",121,70,1430166,,152,2,3,183,,,,,,,
351,So I don't think it's there's certain barriers they're facing difficulties in domestic market.,121,70,1430166,,335,3,4,94,,,,,,,
352,Okay.,122,71,1430166,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
353,So it's only the tariff right now and is there a risk of that tariff being reduced further?,122,71,1430166,,5,1,1,91,,,,,,,
354,"Well, yeah, it will be go away to the 0% in year 2016.",123,72,1430166,,0,0,0,54,,,,,,,
355,Okay.,124,73,1430166,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
356,And what are your thoughts on your market share position relative to this decreasing tariff?,124,73,1430166,,5,1,1,92,,,,,,,
357,And what do you think the Europeans could gain in market share at your expense?,124,73,1430166,,97,2,2,79,,,,,,,
358,"Well, in domestic markets, we already have over 45% of market share.",125,74,1430166,,0,0,0,68,,,,,,,
359,"So, and also that we are not actually competing with the premium brands like BMW or Mercedes.",125,74,1430166,,68,1,1,93,,,,,,,
360,"So we don't think there, the expansion in the Korean market will hurt our sales, and for that lowered mass production brand like Volkswagen, also â€“ they are expanding the presence in domestic market.",125,74,1430166,,161,2,2,201,,,,,,,
361,But I believe the quality of the product itself is almost a similar level with the Volkswagen and the Hyundai.,125,74,1430166,,362,3,3,110,,,,,,,
362,So we try to bring the customers back from the ,125,74,1430166,,472,4,4,47,,,,,,,
363,Okay.,126,75,1430166,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
364,Thank you.,126,75,1430166,,5,1,1,10,,,,,,,
365,Next question will come from Perry Vickery with Columbia Management.,127,76,1430166,4,0,0,0,68,,,,,,,
366,Thanks for taking my question.,128,77,1430166,8,0,0,0,30,,,,,,,
367,Two questions if I could.,128,77,1430166,8,30,1,1,25,,,,,,,
368,"Your operating margin in the auto side are up around 10% or 11%, is there a long term target?",128,77,1430166,8,55,2,2,93,,,,,,,
369,"In other words, do you think you can continue to raise that or are your initiatives like platform integration and things like that, mostly just to sustain that margin level?",128,77,1430166,8,148,3,3,173,,,,,,,
370,"And then second question, can you talk a little bit about your capacity utilization right now and is there a possibility, for say, more overtime or anything like that to increase that, or will production for next year just grow at your increase in capacity?",129,77,1430166,8,0,0,4,257,,,,,,,
371,Thanks.,129,77,1430166,8,257,1,5,7,,,,,,,
372,"For the Op margin, we don't have any, the set up target for these factories, but as I mentioned our strategy is we are focused on how we can improve our quality growth.",130,78,1430166,,0,0,0,168,,,,,,,
373,"I mean the quality is not only the product quality, but also the brand quality.",130,78,1430166,,168,1,1,79,,,,,,,
374,"And then, I mean, given that, will be Op improvement.",130,78,1430166,,247,2,2,53,,,,,,,
375,"So â€“ and then there are one more thing is year 2013, so integrated platform portion maybe gradually increased to 100%.",131,78,1430166,,0,0,3,120,,,,,,,
376,"So under this situation, if the whole circumstances that similar like this kind of levels, we believe that our margins level can be improved.",131,78,1430166,,120,1,4,141,,,,,,,
377,"But as you know the OP margins or the profit was combined with a lot of factors that only come from inside the various matters, so from the outside matters.",131,78,1430166,,261,2,5,156,,,,,,,
378,So the â€“ our strategy is to â€“ we want to keep going and we want to keep the sustainability of the â€“ this kind of the high margins as a best OEM brand.,131,78,1430166,,417,3,6,156,,,,,,,
379,"And therefore capacity, is nowadays we have the 3.87 million capacity, and then we are â€“ this year, we start with Russia plants and then our Czech plant today adding 100k more by changing there, the working shift, from two shift to the three shifts.",131,78,1430166,,573,4,7,251,,,,,,,
380,"And last year the China third plant, we will be starting in the middle of the next year with 300k capacity, and Brazilian plant will be started at the end of 2012.",131,78,1430166,,824,5,8,163,,,,,,,
381,"So our total capacity will be 4.32 million at end of the 2012, and after that time, we don't have the any specific plan to adding another capacity, global basis.",131,78,1430166,,987,6,9,161,,,,,,,
382,"I guess, this could â€“ the current capacity utilization, are you running above a 100% or how is it right now?",132,79,1430166,8,0,0,0,110,,,,,,,
383,The key to our third quarter is our total utilization.,133,80,1430166,,0,0,0,54,,,,,,,
384,"I mean, global utilization was the 105%, and if you divide the Korean plant is the 99%, and overseas plant is 110%.",133,80,1430166,,54,1,1,115,,,,,,,
385,"For the disc utilization based upon our design the capacity, I mean design the capacity meaning is the five days, 10 hours and two shift based.",133,80,1430166,,169,2,2,143,,,,,,,
386,So if we work in the Saturday or something over work we can expect our â€“ the utilization can be adding the 10% to 15% more based upon the designs capacities.,133,80,1430166,,312,3,3,159,,,,,,,
387,"But it's already different, I mean the area by areas.",134,80,1430166,,0,0,4,53,,,,,,,
388,"One example is there last month our Chinese operation they made the 73,000 units that's over 140% of the utilization for their month fees.",134,80,1430166,,53,1,5,138,,,,,,,
389,Sometimes we can't do that kind of oral work but the general price we can say over 10% to 15% more from the designed capacity if the regional numbers is over time â€“ from the over time.,134,80,1430166,,191,2,6,186,,,,,,,
390,All right.,135,81,1430166,8,0,0,0,10,,,,,,,

408,"Despite Hyundai's automotive division's operating profit margin recording a record high of 10.6% for the fourth quarter, numbers have slightly missed the Bloomberg consensus, mainly due to a one-off cost from its finance division, but I think the fundamentals do remain intact and I think the prospects do look bright for 2012.",141,87,1449281,10,53,3,3,327,,,,,,,

646,We'll take our first question today from ,212,114,1472171,15,20,1,1,41,,,,,,,
647,"Hi, thanks for taking my question.",213,115,1472171,,0,0,0,34,,,,,,,
648,"I was wondering if you could comment on the sustainability, I'm mean you just did Hyundai Kia sales but on the equity earnings just if you have any guidance for what we can expect going forward and what the major drivers are in a normal quarter?",213,115,1472171,,34,1,1,245,,,,,,,
649,Hold a second please.,214,116,1472171,14,0,0,0,21,,,,,,,
650,"During the first quarter, as our equity income we've got KRW779 billion among KRW779 billion, KRW172 billion was come as a one-time gaining through the start of the Kia so the less of the amount is the KRW600 â€“ almost KRW650 billion Korean won is the actual equity income in first quarter of 2012.",214,116,1472171,14,21,1,1,299,,,,,,,
651,And then the most of our equity income is related really to the Kia Motors and our Chinese operation and in the Beijing Automotive.,214,116,1472171,14,320,2,2,131,,,,,,,
652,At this time though it is a bit hard to give to you some detail about those kind of numbers because of the Kia Motors they will announce their reserves today.,214,116,1472171,14,451,3,3,158,,,,,,,

655,Thank you.,215,117,1472171,,5,1,1,10,,,,,,,
656,"And then also there's been some commentary about the warranty expense declining to 1% of sales, down from somewhere around 1.5% for most quarters last year, can you comment on what's driving the warranty expense down and if you expect that to stay well in that kind of a one-time event and what â€“ just what your expectations are for warranty expense?",215,117,1472171,,15,2,2,352,,,,,,,

658,And then one more â€“ the important thing is the unit gain operations.,216,118,1472171,14,151,1,1,70,,,,,,,
659,"But at the first quarter, the Korean won appreciated around 1.3% against the U.S.",216,118,1472171,14,221,2,2,81,,,,,,,
660,dollars.,216,118,1472171,14,302,3,3,8,,,,,,,
661,So that's the one of the reasons why the won provisions are down from the normal seasons.,216,118,1472171,14,310,4,4,89,,,,,,,
662,"And then I just want to emphasize the one thing at the first quarter of 2011, there was the one-off spend of course for the warranty because of the -- at the initial stage of the 2011 re-audit, IFRS rules, on the IFRS, we had to consider some more amount because we have to cover some ",216,118,1472171,14,399,5,5,285,,,,,,,

664,"First quarter, yes, that's the one thing.",218,120,1472171,14,0,0,0,41,,,,,,,

666,At the first quarter of the 2011 there was this something a one-time spending.,218,120,1472171,14,79,2,2,78,,,,,,,
667,Yeah.,219,121,1472171,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
668,And then the â€“ something seasonality can be the one of the reason why there was something low warranties.,220,122,1472171,14,0,0,0,107,,,,,,,
669,Okay.,221,123,1472171,,0,0,0,5,,,,,,,
670,And then I'd also like to ask you've been running at well in excess of stated capacity.,221,123,1472171,,5,1,1,87,,,,,,,
671,I guess there's kind of two questions that come to mind from that.,221,123,1472171,,92,2,2,66,,,,,,,
672,Can you â€“ is there anything that you are doing or plan to do to increase the high-end model so you can improve your mix further given your capacity or just what do you think the actual maximum capacity that you'll likely run at for the remainder of this year will be?,221,123,1472171,,158,3,3,269,,,,,,,
673,Hold a second please.,222,124,1472171,14,0,0,0,21,,,,,,,
674,At the first quarter our utilization on a global basis is 109% but still our inventory level is only 1.9 months ,222,124,1472171,14,21,1,1,112,,,,,,,
675,And do you have any ability to increase the number of options that customers might take on the average vehicle and you might get that would be showing up then average price.,223,125,1472171,,0,0,0,173,,,,,,,
676,"I don't know because you do offer quite a few options as standard versus competition, but is there any ability to increase price in that way, just the same model but better options?",223,125,1472171,,173,1,1,181,,,,,,,
677,"Yes, we showed a certain kind of trend, even the motors are same, there were some change because of the customer they started to order some more options at each motors.",224,126,1472171,14,0,0,0,168,,,,,,,
678,"So because of that during 2011, from the first quarter to the second quarter and third quarters, our ASP for the exports from the Korean factory was gradually increased from the US$13,500 to the US$16,300.",224,126,1472171,14,168,1,1,205,,,,,,,
679,"So that can be the â€“ one of the reason how we can improve the ASP through the option changes and there can be some of the mixture of the model mix changes also, but anyway though we can see those kind of trends so that we increased our ASP can be gradually improved to find options with changes.",224,126,1472171,14,373,2,2,297,,,,,,,

689,"The Chinese plant is coming up in second half of 2012, but though we need some kind of wrap up here so we're only expecting about 100,000 units this year, but at full capacity will be 200,000 for 2013. ",228,130,1472171,14,0,0,0,202,,,,,,,
